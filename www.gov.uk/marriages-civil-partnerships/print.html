  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can get married or enter into a civil partnership if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>16 or over</li>
  <li>free to marry, or form a civil partnership (single, divorced or widowed)</li>
  <li>not closely related</li>
</ul>
<p>You need permission from your parents or guardians if you’re under 18.</p>

<h2>Anglican marriages</h2>

<p>If you want to get married in an Anglican Church, contact:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.achurchnearyou.com/" title="your local church in England">your local church in England</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/rb/findchurch.php" title="your local church in Wales">your local church in Wales</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The church can help you with the official arrangements for the marriage.</p>

<h2>Other marriages or civil partnerships</h2>

<p>For all other marriages or civil partnerships you must give notice at your local register office. </p>

<p>Your notice is publicly displayed in the register office for 15 days.</p>

<p>Contact your <a href="/register-offices/" title="local register office">local register office</a> to make an appointment.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You need to give the register office at least 16 days’ notice of your marriage or civil partnership.</p>
</div>

<p>You can only use a register office if you have lived in the registration district for at least the past 7 days.</p>

<h2>If you’re living abroad and want to marry in England or Wales</h2>

<p>If you’re a British or Commonwealth citizen living abroad, you may be able to give notice in the country where you’re living. </p>

<p>Contact the register office for the district in England and Wales where you intend to marry.</p>

<h2>If you’re a foreign national</h2>

<p>If you or your partner are foreign nationals, and subject to immigration control, you must go to one of the register offices in the list below.</p>

<p>You must both go together at the same time.</p>

<p>You must have have the correct entry clearance before you travel to the UK to marry or register a civil partnership.</p>

<p>Find out more on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/while-in-uk/marriageandcivilpartnership/" title="UK Border Agency website">UK Border Agency website.</a> </p>

<h2>If you want to get married abroad</h2>

<p>If you want to get married abroad, contact the country’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/what-we-do/protocol/embassies-in-uk" title="embassy in the UK">embassy in the UK,</a> which will tell you which documents you need.</p>

<p>You can’t register an overseas marriage or civil partnership in the UK, but it will usually be recognised if it’s valid in the other country.</p>

<h2>Get your documents sent to the UK</h2>

<p>If you get married abroad, you can get the marriage or civil partnership documents sent to the UK, to make it easier to get copies.</p>

<p>Find out how to <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/births-deaths-marriages-civil/marriage-and-civil-partnerships/depositing" title="'deposit' documents in the UK ">‘deposit’ documents in the UK.</a></p>

<p>You can’t do this if you got married in a Commonwealth country.</p>

</article><article id="documents-to-take-to-the-register-office"><header><h1>Part 2: Documents to take to the register office</h1>
  </header><p>When you go to the register office, you need to take proof of your name, age and nationality, eg your:</p>

<ul>
<li>passport</li>
  <li>birth certificate</li>
  <li>driving licence</li>
</ul>
<p>The registrar will need something with your address on it - eg your driving licence or a recent:</p>

<ul>
<li>Council Tax bill</li>
  <li>gas, water or electricity bill</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You each need to pay a £35 fee when you attend the register office to give notice.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you’ve been divorced or widowed</h2>

<p>If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you need to take:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a href="/copy-decree-absolute-final-order" title="decree absolute or final order">decree absolute or final order</a>, or</li>
  <li>the <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/" title="death certificate">death certificate</a> of your former partner</li>
</ul>
<p>A foreign divorce will usually be recognised in England and Wales if it was valid in the country where it took place.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure if an overseas divorce is valid, check with the registrar. The registrar may then have to get in touch with the General Register office to confirm your divorce is valid. </p>

</article><article id="weddings-and-civil-partnership-ceremonies"><header><h1>Part 3: Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies</h1>
  </header><p>A religious wedding can take place at a church, chapel or other religious building.</p>

<p>You can have a civil ceremony or civil partnership at:</p>

<ul>
<li>a register office</li>
  <li>any venue approved by the local council - eg a stately home or hotel</li>
</ul>
<p>The Home Office has a list of <a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/ips/general-ips-publications/civil-reg/approved-premises.csv?view=Standard&amp;pubID=1080230" title="Approved civil marriage and civil partnership venues on the Home Office website">all approved civil marriage and civil partnership venues.</a></p>

<p>You will need to have at least 2 witnesses at the ceremony.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Civil ceremonies can include readings, songs or music, but must not include anything that’s religious - eg hymns or readings from the Bible.</p>
</div>

<h2>Wedding vows</h2>

<p>If you’re getting married you must exchange some formal wording.</p>

<p>Discuss any other wording you want in the ceremony with the person conducting the wedding.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You don’t need to exchange vows for a civil partnership, but you can do so if you wish.</p>
</div>

<h2>Signing the register</h2>

<p>You, your partner and your 2 witnesses must sign the marriage register or civil partnership document.</p>

<h2>Cost of registering a marriage or civil partnership</h2>

<p>You will have to pay a fee to register the marriage or civil partnership. </p>

<p>This is £45 if you have the ceremony at a register office, but may be more at other venues. Ask the registrar or religious minister for details.</p>

<p>The marriage or civil partnership certificate costs £4 on the day of the event - you may need a copy to prove your marital status in the future. </p>
