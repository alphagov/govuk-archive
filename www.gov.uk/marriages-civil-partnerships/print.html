<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.achurchnearyou.com/" title="your local church in England">your local church in England</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The vicar can help you with the official arrangements for the marriage.</p>

<h2>Other marriages or civil partnerships</h2>

<p>For all other marriages or civil partnerships you must give notice at your local register office. Your notice is publicly displayed in the register office for 15 days.</p>

<p>Contact your <a href="/register-offices/" title="local register office">local register office</a> to make an appointment.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">

</div>

<p>You can only use a register office if you have lived in the registration district for at least the past 7 days.</p>

<h2>If you’re living abroad and want to marry in England or Wales</h2>

<p>If you’re a British or Commonwealth citizen living abroad and wanting to marry in England or Wales, you may be able to give notice in the country where you’re living. Contact the register office for the district where you intend to marry.</p>

<h2>If you’re a foreign national</h2>

<p>If you or your partner are foreign nationals, and subject to immigration control, you must both go together to one of the register offices in the list below:</p>

</div>

<p>You must have have the correct entry clearance before you travel to the UK to marry or register a civil partnership.</p>

<p>You can find more information on getting married or registering a civil partnership in the UK if you’re subject to immigration control on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/while-in-uk/marriageandcivilpartnership/" title="getting married or registering a civil partnership in the UK">UK Border Agency website.</a> </p>

<h2>If you want to get married abroad</h2>

<p>If you want to get married abroad, contact the country’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/what-we-do/protocol/embassies-in-uk" title="embassy in the UK">embassy in the UK,</a> who will tell you which documents you need.</p>

<p>You can’t register an overseas marriage or civil partnership in the UK, but it will usually be recognised if it’s valid in the other country.</p>

<p>You can get the marriage or civil partnership documents sent to the UK, to make it easier to get copies. This can be done from a foreign country, but not from a Commonwealth country. Find out about <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/births-deaths-marriages-civil/marriage-and-civil-partnerships/depositing" title="depositing documents in the UK ">depositing documents in the UK.</a> </p>

</article><article id="documents-to-take-to-the-register-office"><header><h1>Part 2: Documents to take to the register office</h1>
  </header><p>When you go to the register office, you need to take proof of your name, age and nationality, eg your:</p>

<ul>
<li>passport</li>
  <li>birth certificate</li>
  <li>driving licence</li>
</ul>
<p>The registrar will need something with your address on it - your driving licence or a recent:</p>

<ul>
<li>bank statement</li>
  <li>Council Tax bill</li>
  <li>gas, water or electricity bill</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You each need to pay a £35 fee when you attend the Register Office to give notice to the registrar for your proposed marriage or civil partnership.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you’ve been divorced or widowed</h2>

<p>If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you need to take:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a href="/copy-decree-absolute-final-order" title="decree absolute or final order">decree absolute or final order</a>, or</li>
  <li>the <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/" title="death certificate">death certificate</a> of your former partner</li>
</ul>
<p>If you divorced overseas, the divorce will usually be recognised in England and Wales if it was valid in the country where it took place.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure if an overseas divorce is valid, check with the registrar.</p>

</article><article id="weddings-and-civil-partnership-ceremonies"><header><h1>Part 3: Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies</h1>
  </header><p>A religious wedding can take place at a church, chapel or other religious building.</p>

<p>You can have a civil ceremony or civil partnership at:</p>

<ul>
<li>a register office</li>
  <li>any venue approved by the local council - eg a stately home or hotel</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://maps.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/MapAction.do?ref=weddingvenues" title="Find a civil marriage or civil partnership venue">Find a civil marriage or civil partnership venue.</a></p>

<p>You will need to have at least 2 witnesses at the ceremony.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Civil ceremonies can include readings, songs or music, but must not include anything that’s religious - eg hymns or readings from the Bible.</p>
</div>

<h2>Wedding vows</h2>

<p>If you’re getting married you must exchange some formal wording.</p>

<p>Discuss any other wording you want in the ceremony with the person conducting the wedding.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You don’t need to exchange vows for a civil partnership, but you can do so if you wish.</p>
</div>

<h2>Signing the register</h2>

<p>You, your partner and your 2 witnesses must sign the marriage register or civil partnership document.</p>

<h2>Cost of registering a marriage or civil partnership</h2>

<p>You will have to pay a fee to register the marriage or civil partnership. </p>

<p>This is £45 if you have the ceremony at a register office, but may be more at other venues. Ask the registrar or religious minister for details.</p>

<p>The marriage or civil partnership certificate costs £4 on the day of the event - you may need a copy to prove your marital status in the future. </p>
