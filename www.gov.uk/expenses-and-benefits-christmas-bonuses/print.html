  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing Christmas bonuses to your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<p>This depends on:  </p>

<ul>
<li>whether you give cash bonuses or goods (gifts) to an employee</li>
  <li>if you give goods to an employee, whether or not they can be resold for cash</li>
  <li>whether the employee is a director, and how much they earn</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report anything to HM Revenue &amp; Customs or pay tax and National Insurance if: </p>

<ul>
<li>you give goods that can’t be resold for cash to employees who earn <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="Calculate earnings 'at a rate'">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the Christmas bonuses you provide aren’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-christmas-bonuses/whats-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you may have to report them to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>), and deduct and pay tax and National Insurance (<abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr>) on them.</p>

<h2>Cash bonus</h2>

<p>Any cash you give to employees as a Christmas bonus counts as earnings, so you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>add the value to your employee’s other earnings</li>
  <li>deduct and pay Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) tax and Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> through payroll</li>
</ul>
<h2>Goods</h2>

<p>If you give goods as Christmas gifts to employees, what you have to report and pay depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>whether or not they can be resold for cash</li>
  <li>whether you give them to company directors or employees who earn <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="Calculate earnings 'at a rate'">at a rate</a> of more than £8,500 a year</li>
</ul>
