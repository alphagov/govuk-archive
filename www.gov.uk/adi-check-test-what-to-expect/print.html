  <li>are not currently working as an <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It lasts for about 1 hour. There’s a 15 minute debrief at the end of the test when you get a grade of your performance.</p>

<h2>How check tests are booked</h2>

</article><article id="what-happens-during-the-check-test"><header><h1>Part 3: What happens during the check test</h1>
  </header><p>A check test usually involves the examiner watching a lesson you give to a real pupil.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a pupil available you can use:</p>

<ul>
<li>someone with a full driving licence, but they can’t be an approved driving instructor (<abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the examiner, who will act as a pupil in a role-play check test</li>
</ul>
<h2>What the examiner looks for</h2>

<p>The examiner will look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>how you instruct, and how clear, thorough and correct your instruction is</li>
  <li>your observation of the pupil’s errors, and whether or not you correct them properly</li>
  <li>your manner, patience, tact and ability to inspire confidence</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll be assessed on 3 main areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>core competencies</li>
  <li>instructional techniques</li>
  <li>instructor characteristics</li>
</ul>
<h2>Core competencies</h2>

<p>The core competencies that the examiner will assess are:</p>

<ul>
<li>fault identification</li>
  <li>fault analysis</li>
  <li>remedial action</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructional techniques</h2>

<p>The examiner will assess your instructional techniques on how you:</p>

<ul>
<li>give a recap of the previous lesson at the start</li>
  <li>set relevant aims and objectives for the lesson</li>
  <li>match your level of instruction to the ability and experience of the ‘pupil’</li>
  <li>plan the lesson</li>
  <li>control the lesson</li>
  <li>communicate</li>
  <li>ask questions and listen to the answers</li>
  <li>give feedback and encouragement</li>
  <li>use the dual controls</li>
  <li>give a recap at the end</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructor characteristics</h2>

<p>The examiner will assess if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a relaxed and friendly manner, but aren’t overly familiar</li>
  <li>appear confident and are able to fill your ‘pupil’ with confidence in a patient and tactful way</li>
</ul></article><article id="your-check-test-grade"><header><h1>Part 4: Your check test grade</h1>
  </header><p>At the end of your check test, the examiner will:</p>

<ul>
<li>give you your grade from 1 to 6</li>
  <li>discuss your performance with you</li>
  <li>give you a copy of the marking sheet</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your grade will determine how long it’ll be before you have to take your next check test.</p>
</div>

<h2>Grades you can get</h2>

<p>You’ll usually have to take a check test again within:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 years if you get a grade 4</li>
  <li>4 years if you get a grade 5 or 6</li>
</ul>
<h3>Grade 2 or 3</h3>

<p>If you get a grade 2 or 3, you’ll have 2 more attempts to meet the required standard.</p>

<p>If you need a 3rd test, a more senior examiner will take it. This is to make sure that the process is fair and transparent.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The approved driving instructor (<abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>) registrar will start removing you from the register if you don’t reach an acceptable standard in 3 consecutive check tests.</p>
</div>

<p>If this happens, you’ll have to retake and pass all the <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> qualifying tests to join the register again.</p>

<h3>Grade 1</h3>

<p>If you get a grade 1 you only get 1 more attempt to prove that you can meet the required standard. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registrar will start removing you from the register If you don’t meet the standard.</p>
</div>

<h2>Educational check test</h2>

<p>If you’re a newly qualified <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> and your instruction is not acceptable, you’ll get an ‘E’ grade. You’ll normally have to take the check test again within 6 months.</p>
