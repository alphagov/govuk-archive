  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer covering the costs of congestion charges for your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<p>Different rules apply depending on whether the employee used a company vehicle or their own car, and whether they were travelling on business or not.</p>

<h2>Business travel</h2>

<p>Travelling on business means that the employee either travels as part of their job (eg for meetings) or needs to go to a temporary workplace. Everything else is counted as private travel.</p>


</article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report or pay anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> if the employee is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>driving in a company vehicle </li>
  <li>using their own vehicle for business travel and earning <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If congestion charges aren’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-congestion-charges/whats-exempt" title="What is exempt">exempt</a>, you must report them to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and may have to deduct and pay tax and National Insurance on them.</p>

<p>The value of the benefit to use is the amount you pay in congestion charges.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can <a href="/apply-for-a-dispensation" title="apply for a dispensation">apply for a dispensation</a>, which means you won’t have to include congestion charges on your end-of-year reports.</p>

<h2>If you reimburse congestion charges for an employee’s private travel</h2>

<p>This counts as earnings, so you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>add the value of the benefit to your employee’s other earnings</li>
  <li>deduct and pay Class 1 National Insurance and <abbr title="Pay as you earn">PAYE</abbr> tax through payroll.  </li>
