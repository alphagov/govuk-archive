  </header><p><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses must:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep records of sales and purchases</li>
  <li>keep a separate summary of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> called a <a href="/vat-record-keeping/vat-account" title="VAT account"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> account</a> </li>
  <li>issue correct <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoices</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to keep <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> records</h2>

<p>You must keep <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> records for at least 6 years. </p>

<p>There are no rules on how you must keep records. You can keep them on paper, electronically or as part of a software program (like book-keeping software). But they must be accurate, complete and readable.</p>

<p>If you’ve lost a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoice you can’t rely on a photocopy. Ask the supplier for a duplicate (marked ‘duplicate’). </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can visit your business to inspect your record keeping and charge you a penalty if they aren’t in order.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="vat-invoices"><header><h1>Part 2: VAT invoices</h1>
  </header><p>Only <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses can issue <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoices and you must: </p>

<ul>
<li>issue and keep valid invoices (these can be paper or electronic) </li>
  <li>keep copies of all your invoices even if you cancel them or produce one by mistake</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can’t reclaim <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> using an invalid invoice, pro-forma invoice, statement or delivery note.</p>
</div>

<h2>Valid invoices</h2>

<p>You’ll use a full <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoice for most transactions. For retail transactions you can use:</p>

<ul>
<li>a simplified invoice for amounts under £250 </li>
  <li>a modified invoice for amounts over £250</li>
</ul>
<p>Include the following information on your invoice, depending on which type you use.</p>

<p>(1) If items are charged at different <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> rates, then show this for each.</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>There are different invoice rules if you use a <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/start/schemes/margin.htm" title="VAT Margin Schemes"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Margin Scheme</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/charging/vat-invoices.htm#8" title="Trading internationally">trade internationally.</a> </p>

<p>If you use the Cash Accounting Scheme you have to stamp an invoice with the amount of cash paid and the date. </p>

<h2>Deadlines</h2>

<p>Usually <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoices must be sent within 30 days of the ‘<a href="/vat-record-keeping/time-of-supply-or-tax-point" title="Date of supply">date of supply</a>’ or the date of payment (if you’re paid in advance).</p>


</article><article id="vat-records"><header><h1>Part 3: VAT records</h1>
  </header><p>Records you must keep include:</p>

<ul>
<li>copies of all invoices you send </li>
  <li>originals of all invoices you receive </li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/charging/self-billing.htm" title="Self-billing">self-billing agreements</a> (this is where the customer prepares the invoice) </li>
  <li>name, address and <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> number of any self-billing suppliers</li>
  <li>debit or credit notes </li>
  <li>import and export records</li>
  <li>records of items you can’t reclaim <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on - eg business entertainment</li>
  <li>records of any goods you give away or take from stock for your <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/special-situations/private-use.htm" title="VAT and private use of stock">private use</a>
</li>
  <li>records of all the zero-rated, reduced or <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> exempt items you buy or sell</li>
  <li>a <a href="/vat-record-keeping/vat-account" title="VAT account"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> account</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also keep general business records such as bank statements, cash books, cheque stubs, paying-in slips and till rolls. </p>

<p>If you use the Cash Accounting Scheme you must use these records to match them against your payment records and receipts.</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<p>Retailers don’t have to issue <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoices unless the customer asks for one (keep a copy). Retailers can issue ‘<a href="/vat-record-keeping/vat-invoices" title="Simplified VAT invoices">simplified invoices</a>’ for supplies under £250. </p>

<h2>Debit and credit notes</h2>

<p>When you return goods to a supplier or a customer returns goods to you, the balance of payment can be settled with a credit or debit note. </p>

<p>Record these in your accounts and keep any original notes. </p>

<p>Credit and debit notes must show the same information as the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoice and:</p>

<ul>
<li>why it was issued</li>
  <li>the total amount credited, excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the number and date of the original <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoice</li>
</ul></article><article id="vat-account"><header><h1>Part 4: VAT account</h1>
  </header><p>You must keep a separate record of the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you charge and the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you pay on your purchases. This record is called a ‘<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> account’.</p>

<p>You use the figures in your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> account to complete your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return. </p>

<p>There aren’t any rules on what a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> account should look like, but it must show:</p>

<ul>
<li>your total <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> sales </li>
  <li>your total <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> purchases </li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you owe HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you can reclaim from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>if your business uses the <a href="/vat-flat-rate-scheme" title="VAT Flat Rate Scheme"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Flat Rate Scheme</a> - the flat rate percentage and turnover it applies to</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on any EU acquisitions (purchases) or dispatches (sales)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Errors</h2>

<p>If you’ve made an error in your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> account must show:</p>

<ul>
<li>the date you discovered the error</li>
  <li>details about the error - eg how it happened, how you corrected it</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also need to report the error to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Bad debts</h2>

<p>If you write off an invoice as a bad debt, you must keep a separate ‘<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> bad debt account’. The debt must be older than 6 months and for each bad debt you must show:</p>

<ul>
<li>total amount of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> involved</li>
  <li>amount written off and any payments you’ve received</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you’re claiming on the debt</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> period(s) you paid the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and are claiming the relief</li>
  <li>invoices details like date, customer name </li>
</ul>
<p>You must keep this information for 4 years.</p>


</article><article id="time-of-supply-or-tax-point"><header><h1>Part 5: Time of supply or tax point</h1>
  </header><p>The tax point (or ‘time of supply’) for a transaction is the date the transaction takes place for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> purposes. </p>

<p>You need to know this because, for example: </p>

<ul>
<li>it’s included on <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoices</li>
  <li>it tells you which <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> period the transaction belongs to </li>
  <li>it tells you which <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return to put the transaction on</li>
</ul>
<p>The tax point can vary, but is usually the following. </p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Situation</th>
      <th>Tax point</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>No invoice needed</td>
      <td>Date of supply</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>
<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoice issued</td>
      <td>Date of invoice</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>
<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoice issued 14 days or more after the date of supply</td>
      <td>Date the supply took place</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Payment or invoice issued in advance of supply</td>
      <td>Date of payment or invoice (whichever is earlier)</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Payment in advance of supply and no <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoice yet issued</td>
      <td>Date payment received</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The date of supply is: </p>

<ul>
<li>for goods - the date they’re sent, collected or made available (eg installed in the customer’s house)</li>
  <li>for services - the date the work is finished</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<p>If you use the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Cash Accounting Scheme, the tax point is always the date the payment is received. </p>

<p>There are <a href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_001596&amp;propertyType=document#P1032_86132%20%E2%80%9CExceptions%20to%20the%20usual%20tax%20point%20rules%E2%80%9D" rel="external">different tax point rules</a> for:</p>

<ul>
<li>certain trades - like barristers, building and construction</li>
  <li>where the supply is not a ‘sale’ – eg business items taken for personal use</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, one sale can give rise to 2 or more tax points - eg where the customer pays a deposit in advance, and then a final payment.</p>
