<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/benefits-adviser" title="Benefits adviser">benefits adviser</a> to work out how much you can get.</p>
</div>

<p>How much you get depends on your circumstances (eg <a href="/employment-support-allowance/eligibility" title="Income">income</a> and the type of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> you qualify for:</p>

<ul>
<li>contribution-based <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> - usually you get this if you’ve got enough <a href="/national-insurance" title="National Insurance">National Insurance contributions</a> (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>) </li>
  <li>income-based <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> - usually you get this if you’re on a low income or you don’t have enough <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After 13 weeks of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> you’ll be put into a group. </p>

<h2>Work-Related Activity Group</h2>

<p>You have to go to regular interviews with an adviser. The adviser can help with things like job goals, improving your skills, work-related issues.</p>

<h3>Benefit sanctions</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> can be reduced if you don’t go to interviews or do work-related activity as agreed with your adviser. The reduction can continue up to 4 weeks after you’ve gone to the interview.</p>

<p>You’ll get a ‘sanction letter’ that says you haven’t gone to an interview and your benefit may be affected. Tell your <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> adviser if you have a good reason for missing the interview. </p>

<p>You’ll get another letter if the decision is made to give you a sanction. Your benefit will only be affected once a decision has been made.</p>

<p>If you get a sanction:</p>

<ul>
<li>the letter tells you how to appeal</li>
  <li>you can also ask for a ‘hardship payment’ </li>
</ul>
<h2>Support Group</h2>

<p>You don’t have to go to interviews, but you can ask to talk to a personal adviser if you want to. You’re usually in this group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Contribution-based <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> lasts 1 year if you’re in the Work-Related Activity Group (you may be moved onto income-based <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> after this time).</p>
</div>

<h2>How you’re paid</h2>

<p>All benefits, pensions and allowances are paid <a href="/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid" title="how to have your benefits paid">into an account</a>, eg your bank account.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>From April 2013 a <a href="/benefit-cap" title="benefit cap">cap</a> (limit) will be put on the total amount of benefit that most people aged 16 to 64 can get. The cap won’t affect you if you’re in the Support Group.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>You may get Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) if your illness or disability affects your ability to work and you’re: </p>

<ul>
<li>under <a href="/state-pension" title="State Pension">State Pension</a> age </li>
  <li>not getting Statutory Sick Pay or Statutory Maternity Pay and you haven’t gone back to work</li>
  <li>not getting Jobseeker’s Allowance </li>
</ul>
<p>You can apply for <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> if you’re employed, self-employed, unemployed or a student on <a href="/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit" title="Disability Living Allowance">Disability Living Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>You may get <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> if you’ve lived or work abroad and paid enough National Insurance (UK or equivalent). </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/benefits-adviser" title="Benefits adviser">benefits adviser</a> to check your eligibility.</p>
</div>

<h2>Working and claiming <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Usually your <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> isn’t affected if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>do volunteer work </li>
  <li>work and earn up to £20 a week</li>
  <li>work and earn up to £99.50 a week doing work supervised by someone from a local council or voluntary organisation</li>
  <li>work less than 16 hours a week, earn up to £99.50 a week for up to 52 weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called ‘permitted work’. </p>

<p>You can also do ‘supported permitted work’ for less than 16 hours a week and earn up to £99.50 a week for up to 52 weeks.</p>

<p>Supported permitted work is supervised by someone from a local council or a voluntary organisation whose job it is to arrange work for disabled people.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Tell the <a href="/contact-jobcentre-plus" title="Contact your Jobcentre Plus office">Jobcentre Plus office</a> dealing with your claim if your circumstances change - this can affect your <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> (eg income changes, you go abroad).</p>
</div>

<h2>Your income and savings</h2>

<p>Your income may affect your income-based or contribution-based <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>. Income can include: </p>

<ul>
<li>you and your partner’s income</li>
  <li>savings over £6,000 </li>
  <li>pension income</li>
</ul>
<p>You won’t qualify for income-based <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> if you have savings over £16,000. </p>

<h2>Work Capability Assessment</h2>

<p>You’ll be asked to fill out the ‘Limited capability for work’ questionnaire during your application.</p>

<p>During the first 13 weeks of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> you might also have to go to a Work Capability Assessment. This is to see if your illness or disability affects your ability to work, and can include a medical assessment. </p>

<p>You’ll get a letter explaining what to do. Your benefit may be stopped if you don’t go. </p>

</article><article id="further-information"><header><h1>Part 5: Further information</h1>
  </header><h2>Moving from Incapacity Benefits to Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</h2>

<p>You’ll be told whether you’re in the Support Group or Work-Related Activity Group after the review of your claim to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Incapacity Benefit</li>
  <li>Income Support paid because of illness or disability</li>
  <li>Severe Disablement Allowance</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your benefit will be transferred automatically and there will be no break in the payments you receive.</p>
</div>

<p>If the amount of Incapacity Benefit you get is more than the amount of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, you’ll get a ‘top-up payment’. This means that you’ll continue to get the same amount of money as you get now. The amount of benefit you get won’t rise until the amount of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> catches up with the amount of the top-up payment.   </p>

<p>If the amount of Incapacity Benefit you get is lower than the amount of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, you will get more money. Your money will increase as soon as you move to <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>.</p>
