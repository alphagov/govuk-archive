<h2>Work-related support and interviews</h2>

<p>After 13 weeks of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> you’ll be put into a group. </p>

<p>In the Work-Related Activity Group - you’ll be expected to look for work and go to regular interviews with an adviser. The adviser can help with things like job goals, improving your skills, work-related issues. Your <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> may stop if you don’t take part in these interviews. Contribution-based <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> lasts 1 year if you’re put into the Work-Related Activity Group. </p>

<p>In the Support Group - you don’t have to go to interviews, but you can ask to talk to a personal adviser if you want to. You’re usually in this group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do. </p>

<h2>How you’re paid</h2>

<p>All benefits, pensions and allowances are paid <a href="/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid" title="how to have your benefits paid">into an account</a>, eg your bank account.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>From April 2013 a <a href="/benefit-cap" title="benefit cap">cap</a> (limit) will be put on the total amount of benefit that most people aged 16 to 64 can get. The cap won’t affect you if you’re in the Support Group.</p>

  </header><h2>Moving from Incapacity Benefits to Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</h2>

<p>You’ll be told whether you’re in the Support Group or Work-Related Activity Group after the review of your claim to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Incapacity Benefit</li>
  <li>Income Support paid because of illness or disability</li>
  <li>Severe Disablement Allowance</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your benefit will be transferred automatically and there will be no break in the payments you receive.</p>
</div>

<p>If the amount of Incapacity Benefit you get is more than the amount of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, you’ll get a ‘top-up payment’. This means that you’ll continue to get the same amount of money as you get now. The amount of benefit you get won’t rise until the amount of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> catches up with the amount of the top-up payment.   </p>

<p>If the amount of Incapacity Benefit you get is lower than the amount of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, you will get more money. Your money will increase as soon as you move to <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>.</p>
