</header><article id="driving-licence-rules-and-what-you-can-tow"><header><h1>Part 1: Driving licence rules and what you can tow</h1>
  </header><p>The rules on what you can tow are different depending on when you passed your driving test.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The rules are changing for new licences issued from 19 January 2013 onwards.</p>
</div>

<h2>Licences held from 1 January 1997</h2>

<p>If you passed your driving test after 1 January 1997 and have an ordinary category B (car) licence, you can drive either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes or 3,500 kilograms (kg) Maximum Authorised Mass (<abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr>) towing a trailer of up to <abbr title="kilograms">750kg</abbr> <abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr> (with a combined weight of up to 4,250kg in total)</li>
  <li>a trailer over <abbr title="kilograms">750kg</abbr> <abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr> as long as it is no more than the unladen or ‘kerb’ weight of the towing vehicle (with a combined weight of up to <abbr title="kilograms">3,500kg</abbr> in total)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>For anything heavier you need to take a <a href="/towing-with-car/car-trailer-practical-test" title="Car and trailer practical test">category B+E driving test</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Licences held before 1 January 1997</h2>

<p>If you passed your car test before 1 January 1997 you are generally entitled to drive a vehicle and trailer combination up to 8.25 tonnes <abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr>.</p>

<p>This is the weight of a vehicle or trailer including the maximum load that can be carried safely when it’s being used on the road.</p>

<p>You also have entitlement to drive a minibus with a trailer over <abbr title="kilograms">750kg</abbr> <abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Licences issued from 19 January 2013</h2>

<p>From 19 January 2013, drivers passing a category B (car and small vehicle) test can tow:</p>

<ul>
<li>small trailers weighing no more than <abbr title="kilograms">750kg</abbr>
</li>
  <li>trailers weighing more than <abbr title="kilograms">750kg</abbr>, where the combined weight of the towing vehicle and the trailer isn’t more than <abbr title="kilograms">3,500kg</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to tow a trailer weighing more than <abbr title="kilograms">750kg</abbr>, when the combined weight of the towing vehicle and trailer is more than <abbr title="kilograms">3,500kg</abbr>, you’ll have to pass a further test and get B+E entitlement on your licence.</p>

<p>You’ll then be able to tow trailers up to <abbr title="kilograms">3,500kg</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Towing heavier combinations</h2>

<p>If you want to tow heavier combinations, you’ll have to first <a href="/adding-higher-categories-to-your-driving-licence" title="apply for provisional entitlement">apply for provisional entitlement</a> to the new C1+E entitlement. You’ll then have to pass the category C theory test and C1+E practical test.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done this you can drive vehicles and trailers with a combined weight of up to 12 tonnes <abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr>.</p>


</article><article id="car-towing-weight-and-width-limits"><header><h1>Part 2: Car towing weight and width limits</h1>
  </header><p>Most cars have a maximum weight of what they can tow. It’s usually listed in the handbook or specification sheet.</p>

<p>Alternatively the vehicle’s <strong>gross train weight</strong> may be listed on the vehicle identification number (<abbr title="vehicle identification number">VIN</abbr>) plate on the car. This is normally under the bonnet or inside the driver’s door. The gross train weight is the weight of the fully loaded car plus fully loaded trailer and must not be exceeded.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="vehicle identification number">VIN</abbr> plate doesn’t list a train weight, you should not use your vehicle for towing.</p>

<h2>Width and length</h2>

<p>The maximum trailer width for any towing vehicle is 2.55 metres. The maximum length is 7 metres for a trailer towed by a vehicle weighing up to 3.5 tonnes (3,500 kilograms).</p>


</article><article id="towing-equipment-safety-standards"><header><h1>Part 3: Towing equipment safety standards</h1>
  </header><p>The equipment you use with your trailer or caravan must meet certain safety standards.</p>

<h2>Towing bars</h2>

<p>If you get a tow bar for your car, it needs to be ‘type approved’. This means it meets <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations and is designed for your car.</p>

<p>A type-approved tow bar will have a label with an approval number and details of the vehicles it’s approved for.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If your car was first used before 1 August 1998, your tow bar doesn’t need to be type-approved.</p>
</div>

<h2>Towing mirrors</h2>

<p>You must have an adequate view of the road behind you. If your caravan or trailer is wider than the rear of the towing vehicle, you may need to fit suitable towing mirrors.</p>

<p>If you tow without proper towing mirrors you can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>prosecuted by the police</li>
  <li>given 3 points on your licence</li>
  <li>fined up to £1,000</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trailer brakes</h2>

<p>Any trailer weighing over 750 kilograms must have a working brake system.</p>

<p>Some smaller trailers also have brakes, although these are optional.</p>

<p>Any brakes on a trailer or caravan must be in good working order.</p>

<h2>A-frames and dollies</h2>

<p>If you attach an A-frame to a car in order to tow it with a larger vehicle, the car plus A-frame counts as a trailer.</p>

<p>If you use a dolly to tow a broken-down vehicle, the dolly counts as a trailer.</p>

<p>In both cases the usual safety regulations for trailers apply.</p>

  </header><p>American trailers and caravans don’t always meet European safety regulations.</p>

<p>If you want to use an American caravan or trailer in the UK or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you must first check that it’s legal.</p>

</article><article id="car-trailer-practical-test"><header><h1>Part 5: The car and trailer practical test</h1>
  </header><p>If you want to tow a caravan or certain types of trailer you may have to take a further test.</p>

<h2>Licences held from 1 January 1997</h2>

<p>You’ll need to take a practical test to get a B+E entitlement on your licence if you passed your driving test after this date and hold a category B (car) licence. </p>

<p>You’ll need to do this if you want to tow a trailer or caravan heavier than 750 kilograms (<abbr title="Kilogram">kg</abbr>) when the combined maximum authorised mass (<abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr>) of the towing vehicle and the trailer or caravan is more than 3,500kg.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr> means the weight of a vehicle or trailer including the maximum load that can be carried safely when it’s being used on the road. This is also known as gross vehicle weight.</p>
