<h2 id="what-are-british-forces-doing-in-iraq">What are British forces doing in Iraq?</h2>

<p>British Armed Forces are helping the Iraqis to rebuild their country after years of neglect and conflict.</p>

<p>Royal Navy personnel, alongside US colleagues, are continuing to play a crucial role in training the Iraqi Navy, a task they have been engaged in since 2004.</p>

<p>Iraq’s ability to rebuild its infrastructure and services after decades of neglect is heavily dependent on income from oil exports. And so it is vital that the Iraqi Navy develops the capability to protect their own territorial waters and offshore oil platforms from which 80% of their oil is exported.</p>

<p>The Iraqi Navy continues to develop well and now has responsibility for the vast majority of Iraqi territorial waters, playing a central role in protecting Iraqi oil export platforms in the Northern Gulf.</p>

<p>The Royal Navy remains on course to complete their contribution to the Training and Maritime Support mission by spring 2011.</p>

<p>We also continue to assist the Iraqi Ministry of Defence with the professionalisation of its Armed Forces as part of a wider NATO mission in Iraq.</p>

<p>The UK has the lead for officer education and training whereby British mentors are providing training and advice to the Iraqi Security Forces.</p>

<p>This mentoring is not only focused on developing the capacity of the Iraqi Security Forces but is also helping to develop Iraqi training structures and institutions, so that in the future Iraq can sustain its security forces and continue to meet the security needs of the Iraqi people.</p>

<h3 id="when-did-the-uk-cease-combat-operations-in-iraq">When did the UK cease combat operations in Iraq?</h3>

<p>UK combat operations were declared complete on 30 April 2009 and all UK combat forces were withdrawn from the country prior to 31 July 2009.</p>

<p>This was a fundamental change of mission that was agreed by the Iraqi and UK governments.</p>

<h3 id="under-what-legal-basis-do-british-forces-remain-in-iraq">Under what legal basis do British forces remain in Iraq?</h3>

<p>British forces remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Government of Iraq. The legal basis for our presence is provided by two separate agreements: the bilateral UK-Iraq Training and Maritime Support Agreement and the multilateral NATO Long Term Agreement.</p>

<p>Royal Navy personnel training the Iraqi Navy and helping to protect Iraq’s maritime infrastructure operate under the Training and Maritime Support Agreement which was signed by the UK and Iraqi governments on 6 June 2009. This agreement entered into force on 22 November 2009 having been ratified by both the UK and Iraqi Parliaments.</p>

<p>The Training and Maritime Support Agreement had a duration of one year and had been due to expire on 22 November 2010. However, on 9 November 2010, the Iraqi Council of Ministers requested that our Royal Navy trainers continue their work under the Training and Maritime Support Agreement.</p>

<p>The UK Government agreed to this request and as such the Royal Navy remains in Iraq to complete their contribution to the mission, most likely by spring next year.</p>

<p>Once the government in Iraq is fully formed and functioning, we expect the Council of Ministers decision to be ratified by the Council of Representatives.</p>

<p>British forces operating within NATO’s Training Mission in Iraq (NTM-I) operate under a separate Long Term Agreement between the Government of Iraq and NATO.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-will-british-forces-stay-in-iraq">How long will British forces stay in Iraq?</h3>

<p>We expect that the Royal Navy will have completed their contribution to the Training and Maritime Support mission by spring 2011.</p>

<p>The Long Term Agreement that NATO has with Iraq is due to expire in December 2011. Work is underway to establish the future of the NATO mission beyond December 2011 but it is too early to determine what this might be, or how the UK might contribute.</p>

<p>The UK and Iraq share a long history of defence cooperation and our partnership will continue to take on new dimensions. This partnership will be strengthened through cooperation in a range of areas including economic development, culture, commerce and education, as well as defence.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-iraq">Security in Iraq</h3>

<p>The Government of Iraq has been responsible for maintaining security throughout Iraq since the expiry of UNSCR 1790 on 31 December 2008, when US and UK military personnel focused on mentoring and supporting the Iraqi Security Forces.</p>

<p>Today, violence is at its lowest level since 2003 and US forces have been able to end combat operations in Iraq, as we did in 2009. US force numbers were reduced to around 50,000 at the end of August 2010 and under Operation New Dawn the US plan to further reduce their presence in Iraq to an Office of Security Cooperation by the end of 2011.</p>

<p>Whilst still capable of appalling atrocities, Al Qaeda in Iraq has suffered repeated setbacks and indiscriminate terrorist attacks have lost it any sympathy it once enjoyed amongst some Iraqi communities.</p>

<p>This reflects the success of the UK and partner forces in training Iraqi troops to be able to deliver security on the streets, thereby allowing the Iraqi authorities to focus on tackling the key social challenges.</p>

<p>Over half-a-million Iraqi police and military personnel have been trained and equipped by Coalition forces since 2004. The Coalition has also worked very closely with the Iraqi authorities to develop their Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Interior.</p>

<p>The Iraqi Police Service has made significant progress in its capability to maintain public order, investigate crimes and arrest suspects. The number of Iraqi units capable of conducting independent counter-insurgency operations is increasing steadily. There are now around 270,000 police officers trained and equipped nationwide, plus some 40,000 border enforcement personnel.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-basra">Security in Basra</h3>

<p>Security is no longer the biggest concern for ordinary Basrawis. In a poll, they put security 15th on their list of issues of concern - well below issues such as employment, public utilities and corruption.</p>

<p>Peaceful Provincial Elections in January 2009 were followed by successful National Elections in March 2010, which further underlined the move away from violence towards the ballot box, in Basra, and across the country.</p>

<p>This progress is vindication for the long-term strategy that we have pursued with our Iraqi partners.</p>

<p>When the Iraqi authorities took on responsibility for security in Basra in 2009 they began to deliver an Iraqi-led security solution which has proved to be so successful. General Petraeus, who personally approved the strategy, said at the time that it was ‘a positive step on the path to Iraqi self-reliance’.</p>

<h3 id="what-british-forces-have-achieved">What British Forces have achieved</h3>

<p>British Forces have been concentrated in southern Iraq. Their key military tasks have been:</p>

<h4 id="security-force-training">Security force training</h4>

<p>UK troops based in the south of Iraq trained over 22,000 policemen and 20,000 Iraqi soldiers between 2004 and 2009; first as part of building up 10th Iraqi Army Division in south-eastern Iraq and, after 2007, training 14th Division in Basra.</p>

<h4 id="basra-international-airport">Basra International Airport</h4>

<p>We have also worked closely with the Iraqi civilian authorities to develop Basra International Airport which will be key to the ongoing economic development of Basra and southern Iraq.</p>

<p>The airport handles some 4,000 passengers a month and is able to cope with significant surges; in December 2008 it proved itself able to handle around 5,000 pilgrims during the Hajj. Scheduled commercial services operate routinely to Baghdad, Jordan and the Gulf States.</p>

<p>The RAF was able formally to hand over control of the airport to the Iraqis on 1 January 2009, the same date as Iraq took back control of its sovereign airspace.</p>

<p>Naval Training: For the past six years British forces have been involved in rebuilding the Iraqi Navy. This work continues today under the auspices of the Training and Maritime Support Agreement that we have with Iraq. Royal Navy ships also continue to patrol the Gulf area and to contribute to the defence of Iraqi territorial waters and oil platforms. The main accomplishments of British forces are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>around 100 Royal Navy personnel are based at the main Iraqi naval base in the southern port of Umm Qasr.</li>
  <li>the Royal Navy are working alongside US colleagues to train and mentor the Iraqi Navy, building up expertise and developing skills that will help the Iraqi Navy develop into a fully independent force, able to carry out its crucial role of protecting Iraq’s territorial waters and maritime infrastructure.</li>
  <li>the Iraqi Navy has noticeably improved its operational capability, generating more frontline presence in Iraqi waters than before.</li>
  <li>Iraq’s maritime security forces are most likely to be the first of all of Iraq’s defence forces to be fully mission-capable, as a direct result of the Royal Navy’s endeavours.</li>
  <li>given the total destruction of the Iraqi Navy under the previous regime, rebuilding it since 2004 has been no small feat. The Royal Navy are making a significant contribution to stability in Iraq.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="officer-training">Officer training</h4>

<p>The UK has been supporting the NATO Training Mission –Iraq (NTM-I) since 2004. Today the UK provides a quarter of the 175 personnel from 14 different nations working within NTM-I. British mentors are providing training and advice to the Iraqi Security Forces in order to contribute to the development of Iraqi training structures and institutions, so that Iraq can continue to build effective, sustainable and self-sufficient security forces in the long term. The main accomplishments of British forces are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>around 40 members of the British Armed Forces are working throughout the Baghdad Area of Operations providing advice, mentoring, training and support to the Iraqi Security Forces.</li>
  <li>the UK has concentrated its effort in the training of the Iraqi officer corps, although it also contributes to NCO training, doctrine development and the Strategic Security Advisory &amp; Mentoring Division (SSAMD), as well as a number of key leadership and supporting roles within the mission.</li>
  <li>UK forces are helping Iraq to develop a self-sustaining, capable and properly governed officer education and training system with which to develop a professional officer corps.</li>
  <li>in particular, investment in the development of young Iraqi officers, through high-end professional education and training, will reap long-term benefits for the Iraqi Security Forces, ensuring a better future for the nation.</li>
  <li>British mentors are providing specialist advice to the Iraqi leadership responsible for Iraqi officer training and education institutions within the National Defence University. They are also undertaking other activities to broaden Iraqi understanding of the needs of a modern professional officer corps. These include facilitating overseas training opportunities to similar officer training institutions within the region and more widely.</li>
  <li>the Iraqi military will also accrue long term benefits through developing English Language competence amongst the officer cohort allowing Iraqi officers to engage meaningfully with the wider international military community.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="uk-based-training">UK based training</h4>

<p>We also continue to offer places for Iraqi officers at UK-based defence training establishments; for example, young Iraqi officers have recently graduated with distinction from RAF Cranwell.</p>

<h3 id="the-sacrifice-of-british-troops-in-iraq">The sacrifice of British troops in Iraq</h3>

<p>Between the start of operations in 2003 and 2009, 178 UK Service personnel and one <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> civilian have died on Operation Telic. We pay tribute to the sacrifice they made in service of their country, and to their family and friends. Iraq’s progress shows that their sacrifice has not been in vain.</p>

<p>All UK personnel that were killed during Operation TELIC are commemorated by a plaque inscribed with their name on the Basra Memorial Wall, which now stands at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. The wall was rededicated in a poignant service on 11 March 2010. The wall was originally constructed by UK forces outside the Multi-National Division South East Headquarters in Basra, to commemorate all UK and Coalition personnel that had died whilst under UK command in southern Iraq. The wall was dismantled at the end of UK combat operations in April 2009 and was shipped back to the UK to be reassembled at the National Arboretum.</p>

<h3 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4 id="what-is-noticas-reporting">What is <abbr title="Notification of Casualty">NOTICAS</abbr> reporting?</h4>

<p>Notification of Casualty (<abbr title="Notification of Casualty">NOTICAS</abbr>) is the name for the formalised system of reporting casualties within the UK Armed Services. It sets in train the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s next-of-kin informing procedure. <abbr title="Notification of Casualty">NOTICAS</abbr> is taken extremely seriously – as the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s Joint Casualty &amp; Compassionate Policy &amp; Procedures set out, <abbr title="Notification of Casualty">NOTICAS</abbr> reports are to be raised for every casualty and the reporting process “must be undertaken as quickly and sensitively as possible and it takes precedence over all but the most urgent operational and security matters”.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-seriously-injured-and-very-seriously-injured-mean">What do ‘Seriously Injured’ and ‘Very Seriously Injured’ mean?</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Notification of Casualty">NOTICAS</abbr> reports raised for casualties contain information on how seriously medical staff in theatre judge their condition to be. This information is used to inform what the next of kin are told. VSI and SI are the two most serious categories into which personnel can be classified:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘Very Seriously Ill/Injured/Wounded’ or VSI – The illness or injury is of such severity that life or reason is imminently endangered.</li>
  <li>‘Seriously Ill/Injured/Wounded’ or SI – The patient’s condition is of such severity that there is cause for immediate concern, but there is no imminent danger to life or reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>The VSI and SI categories are defined by Joint Casualty &amp; Compassionate Policy &amp; Procedures. They are not strictly medical categories but are designed to give an indication of the severity of the illness to inform what the individuals next of kin are told. In the figures above we have excluded those individuals categorised as VSI or SI whose condition was identified to be caused by illness, to produce figures for the number of UK personnel categorised as Very Seriously Injured and Seriously Injured whatever the cause of the injury, but excluding illnesses.</p>

<h4 id="what-about-less-serious-injuries">What about less serious injuries?</h4>

<p>Minor injuries were not consistently reported to the UK during the early stages of Op TELIC due to the tempo of operations. Additional theatre reporting requirements took effect on 11 April 2005, at the same time as the activation of the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Cell at RAF Innsworth. However, there is still variability in the nature of these reports, and so we cannot produce a fully reliable and consistent set of figures.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-the-medical-evacuation-figures-mean">What do the ‘medical evacuation’ figures mean?</h4>

<p>These figures give the total number of aeromedical evacuations, including any aeromed movements connected to the casualty’s treatment outside of Iraq.</p>

<h4 id="why-is-this-figure-higher-than-the-others">Why is this figure higher than the others?</h4>

<p>This is not just troops wounded in action. Personnel can be medically evacuated (“medevaced”) from theatre for a variety of reasons, such as heat stroke and road accidents. The majority of aeromeds have been as a result of illness rather than injury.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-killed-in-action-and-died-of-wounds">What is the difference between Killed in Action and Died of Wounds?</h4>

<p>Killed in Action is the definition used where a battle casualty is killed outright or dies as a result of wounds or other injuries before reaching a medical treatment facility. Died of Wounds is the definition used where a battle casualty dies of wounds or other injuries received in action, after having reached a medical treatment facility.</p>

<h4 id="what-medical-facilities-are-available-for-the-150-troops-that-remain-in-iraq">What medical facilities are available for the 150 troops that remain in Iraq?</h4>

<p>Role 1 medical care for UK personnel based at Umm Qasr is provided by a RN Petty Officer Medical Assistant supported by a US medic, whilst at sea, each ship has integral Role 1 medical support within its scheme of compliment.</p>

<p>For the small number of UK Servicemen working at the NATO Training Mission in Iraq (NTMI) (Fwd) at AR Rustamiyah, Role 1 medical care is provided by a NATO enabled contract as part of the Private Military Security Company (PMSC) which provides the force protection there.</p>

<p>At the British Embassy in Baghdad, where the UK Defence Section is based, Role 1 medical care is provided by contract nurses. All other UK servicemen working in or around Baghdad receive Role 1 medical care from the US military under the Acquisition of Core Services Agreement (ACSA) between the two countries.</p>

<p>All medical care above Role 1, eg, hospital care, for all locations including aero-medical evacuation, is provided by the US military under the ACSA.</p>

<h2 id="british-fatalities">British fatalities</h2>

<p>It is with very deep regret that the Ministry of Defence has confirmed the following fatalities suffered during Operation TELIC.</p>

<p>A total of 179 British Armed Forces personnel or <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> civilians have died serving on Operation TELIC since the start of the campaign in March 2003.</p>

<p>Of these, 136 were killed as a result of hostile action.</p>

<p>43 are known to have died either as a result of illness, non-combat injuries or accidents, or have not yet officially been assigned a cause of death pending the outcome of an investigation.</p>

<p>The balance of these figures may change as inquests are concluded. A more detailed breakdown of fatalities and casualties can be found <a rel="external" href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/OperationsFactsheets/OperationsInIraqBritishCasualties.htm">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="british-forces-in-iraq">British forces in Iraq</h2>

<p>Details of UK military personnel currently deployed to the theatre of operations.</p>

<p>Since 22 November 2009 the UK has maintained a small training force of around 150 British military personnel in Iraq.</p>

<p>The majority of these forces (around 100) are based at the main Iraqi naval base in the southern port of Umm Qasr. These are mostly Royal Navy and Royal Marine personnel, and they are working alongside US colleagues to train and mentor the Iraqi Navy.</p>

<p>They are there at the request of the Iraqi Government under our bilateral training and maritime support agreement which came into effect in November 2009.</p>

<p>This agreement also allows for the presence of Royal Navy ships in Iraqi territorial waters in order to ensure the security of Iraq’s offshore oil pipelines and platforms.</p>

<p>UK forces are also contributing to the NATO Training Mission in Iraq (known as NTM-I) under a separate Agreement between NATO and the Government of Iraq.</p>

<p>There are currently around 40 UK military - mostly Army - personnel based at the military academy in Baghdad undertaking this role alongside other NATO partners. Their role is to train and educate Iraqi military officers.</p>

<p>The remaining UK military personnel are assigned to the Defence Attaché, based in the Defence Section of the British Embassy in Baghdad.</p>

<p>A summary of key information relating to the British and International presence in Iraq.</p>

<h3 id="countries-involved-in-the-coalition-in-iraq">Countries involved in the coalition in Iraq</h3>

<p>International military support to the government of Iraq is currently co-ordinated by the Headquarters of United States Forces - Iraq (USF-I).  Within this construct the UK is the sole bilateral partner, whilst 12 additional countries contribute to NATO’s Training Mission in Iraq. Since 2003 a total of 37 countries contributed to the Multi-National Forces: Iraq.</p>

<h3 id="number-of-uk-military-personnel-in-iraq">Number of UK Military Personnel in Iraq</h3>

<p>There are now around 150 British military personnel serving in Iraq.</p>

<p>The total number of UK personnel deployed on Operation TELIC as a whole is higher - around 850 - as this includes personnel involved in the operation but not situated in Iraq itself (for example Royal Navy ships in the Gulf).</p>

<p>The number of UK military personnel deployed in Iraq has changed over time:</p>

<li>peak during Major Combat Operations (March/April 2003): 46,000 (including those stationed outside of Iraq in support of the operation)</li>
  <li>at the end of May 2003: 18,000</li>
  <li>at the end of May 2004: 8,600</li>
  <li>at the end of May 2005: 8,500</li>
  <li>at the end of May 2006: 7,200</li>
  <li>at the end of May 2007: 5,500</li>
  <li>at the end of May 2008: 4,100 (in southern Iraq)</li>
  <li>at the end of May 2009: 4,100 (in southern Iraq)</li>
  <li>at the end of Jan 2010: 150</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of UK personnel are based in southern Iraq mentoring the Iraqi Navy, with a smaller number based in Baghdad providing training to Iraqi officers as part of the NATO training mission.</p>

<h3 id="iraqi-security-force-development">Iraqi Security Force development</h3>

<p>The coalition has been involved in what was probably the most ambitious security sector reform effort in modern times.  More than 585,000 members of the Iraqi Security Forces have now been trained and equipped.</p>

<h3 id="reconstruction-across-iraq">Reconstruction across Iraq</h3>

<p>The UK has pledged a total commitment of £744 million towards reconstruction in Iraq.  The UK pledged an initial £544m for reconstruction projects at the Madrid Conference in 2003.  The then Chancellor, Gordon Brown, increased this by £100m when he visited Basra in November 2006, and the former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett pledged a further £100m in May 2007.</p>

<p>The funding has helped in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>over five million children have received life-saving vaccinations. There has been a resulting decline in the prevalence of polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and malaria.</li>
  <li>1,000 healthcare facilities have been rehabilitated or equipped and more than 6,000 staff trained.</li>
  <li>access to safe drinking water dropped by one third under the previous regime. Twenty potable water treatment facilities have been built or rehabilitated, and nine centralized sewage treatment facilities have been rehabilitated. More than one million people in southern Iraq have improved access to water.</li>
  <li>Basra International Airport has been undergoing extensive renovation and now handles some 4,000 passengers a month.</li>
  <li>Iraq dropped from 76 to 126 on the Human Development Index under Saddam Hussein. Now, with the support of the international community, for example, education services are being restored, thousands of teachers are being trained and over 5,000 schools have been rehabilitated.</li>
  <li>more than 100,000 primary and 40,000 secondary teachers have been trained.</li>
  <li>2,500 Iraqi NGOs are now registered with the Iraqi government and trade unions.</li>
  <li>576 judges, lawyers and prosecutors have been trained in International Human Rights Law.</li>
  <li>over 3,000 women and young people in the south have been trained in business skills.</li>
  <li>over 180 journalists have been trained in independent journalism and feature writing.</li>
  <li>250 newspapers and magazines have been launched. New TV and radio stations have been set up.</li>
  <li>a new mobile phone network has been introduced with over eight million subscribers.</li>
  <li>oil production is now around two million barrels per day. Production and export facilities are much more secure. Increased oil production and prices have increased Iraq’s revenues from $US18bn (2002) to $US29bn (2005,2006) and $41bn (2007).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a summary of reconstruction in Iraq. For detailed information, please see the website of the Department for International Development (DFID) here.</p>

<h3 id="reconstruction-across-basra">Reconstruction across Basra</h3>

<h4 id="water-and-sewage">Water and sewage</h4>

<ul>
<li>in 2003, only 23% of Basrawis had access to piped water, by far the worst figures for any of Iraq’s 18 provinces. Only 9% of Basrawis were connected to a reliable sewage system.</li>
  <li>since then, improvements to water supplies, including pumps for isolated villages, have benefited over 1.25 million people (70% of Basrawis).</li>
  <li>200km of modern piping have been laid and over 5,000 leaks repaired.</li>
  <li>$160 million invested in modernising and extending sewage system.</li>
  <li>40km of sewers and 7,000 septic tanks have been cleaned.</li>
  <li>a water training centre in Basra has been constructed to train and increase the skills of Iraqi engineers in water treatment and leakage repair.</li>
  <li>a reverse osmosis unit has been refurbished to supply potable water to about 500,000 people.</li>
  <li>improved water supply to 60,000 people in Al Amtahiyah (Basra Province).</li>
  <li>DfID power and water projects will employ around 450 people, generate almost 100,000 workdays and secure around 17,000 workdays per year for operation and maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="power">Power</h4>

<ul>
<li>in 2003, Basra’s power stations had not enjoyed proper investment for three decades.</li>
  <li>since 2003, Department for International Development reconstruction has provided additional electricity equivalent to that needed for a city the size of Leeds.</li>
  <li>the Hartha power stations chimney has been repaired as well as transmission lines from the power station to Basra city.</li>
  <li>65,000 homes now have a mains supply for the first time and 239,000 homes now have a much more reliable mains supply. This is benefiting 1.5 million residents.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="education">Education</h4>

<ul>
<li>the former Multi-National Division (South-East) (MND(SE)) has run almost 400 education projects worth $25 million.</li>
  <li>in 2003, 80% of 7-13 year old Basrawi children attended school.</li>
  <li>since then, attendance has increased by 9.8% (an extra 25,000 children).</li>
  <li>61 primary schools have been refurbished to modern standards.</li>
  <li>in 2003, 49% of 13-16 year old Basrawi children attended school.</li>
  <li>since then, attendance increased by 8.9% (an extra 10,700 children).</li>
  <li>18 secondary schools have been refurbished to modern standards.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="health">Health</h4>

<ul>
<li>in 2003, all 16 Basrawi hospitals discharged untreated waste back into the water supply. Saddam allowed one of the best regional health services in the 1960s to rot. Since then, over $14 million spent by the former MND(SE) alone on 189 health projects, with particular emphasis on refurbishing hospital laundries and providing appropriate sewage and sanitation.</li>
  <li>the Iraqi Government has raised doctors’ salaries from around $30 per month under Saddam, to up to $2,000 per month.</li>
  <li>the Coalition-backed immunisation programme across Iraq protected 98% of under fives against measles/mumps/rubella, and 97% against polio.</li>
  <li>progress has been made in combating malnutrition - the number of Iraqis going hungry reduced by 75% between 2005 and 2007 (from 4 million to 930,000).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="democracy">Democracy</h4>

<ul>
<li>the Iraqis adopted a new permanent constitution by referendum in October 2005, with a turnout of 63%. The constitution defines Iraq as democratic and pluralist.</li>
  <li>elections in January 2005 saw the first true democracy in Iraq for over three decades, and those in December 2005 saw a turnout of over 12 million people, or 76% of the electorate. Iraq’s Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, announced his Government of National Unity on 20 May 2006.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="institution-building">Institution-building</h4>

<ul>
<li>the focus of our efforts has been to build capacity of local authorities to plan for, access and spend central and local funds.</li>
  <li>in Basra, supported production of the first ever Provincial Development Strategy by the Provincial Council.</li>
  <li>on the back of this work, Basra Provincial Council was able to access $US172 million of central government funding in 2006 and $205 million in 2007 (after receiving none in 2005) and is undertaking more than 300 local reconstruction projects based on this work.</li>
  <li>refurbished Governorate offices; trained Governorates officials</li>
  <li>built up financial management and budgeting capacity of governorates.</li>
  <li>576 Iraqi judges, lawyers and prosecutors trained in human rights, international humanitarian law, and independence of the judiciary.</li>
  <li>private sector development</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-business">Local business</h4>

<ul>
<li>established a local Business Journal and Business Information Centre.</li>
  <li>over 3,000 women and young people in the south trained in business and enterprise skills.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="agriculture">Agriculture</h4>

<ul>
<li>60 Agricultural directorate staff trained in administrative, IT and planning skills.</li>
  <li>restoration of the marshlands in Basra, Maysan and Dhi Qar, which resulted in the return of the Marsh Arabs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cost-of-uk-military-action-in-iraq">Cost of UK military action in Iraq</h3>

<p>The costs of our operations in Iraq come from the Treasury Special Reserve.  The Ministry of Defence identifies the costs of military operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred, over and above planned expenditure on defence. The costs for the following financial years were:</p>

<ul>
<li>2002/03 - £847M</li>
  <li>2003/04 - £1,311M</li>
  <li>2004/05 - £910M</li>
  <li>2005/06 - £958M</li>
  <li>2006/07 - £956M</li>
  <li>2007/08 - £1,457M</li>
  <li>2008/09 - £1,381M</li>
  <li>2009/10 - £342M</li>
</ul>
<p>The costs for 2003/04 include the costs of combat operations from 1 April 2003, the costs incurred in maintaining and supporting subsequent peacekeeping operations and the costs of recuperating operational capability afterwards.</p>

<p>British Forces played a key role in the United States-led coalition military operations, which began on 20 March 2003, and ultimately brought down Saddam Hussein’s regime. British Forces, along with US colleagues, continue to work with the democratically-elected Iraqi Government to maintain security and strengthen democracy as well as assist with reconstruction and economic development.</p>
