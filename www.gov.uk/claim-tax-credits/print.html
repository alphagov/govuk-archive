<p>If you’re already claiming tax credits you don’t need a claim form - just call the helpline to update your claim.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re new to tax credits, contact the Tax Credit Helpline for a claim form. You can’t apply online or download the form and it takes up to 2 weeks to arrive. </p>

<p>You can apply for tax credits as a single person or as a couple (known as a ‘<a href="/claim-tax-credits/joint-claims" title="Joint claims">joint claim</a>’).</p>

<div class="contact">

<h3>What happens when you call</h3>

<p>Before you’re sent the form, you’ll be asked for the following and given an estimate of how much you may get:</p>

<ul>
<li>your National Insurance number (if you have one)</li>
  <li>your <a href="/claim-tax-credits/what-counts-as-income" title="What counts as income">income</a> for the last tax year </li>
  <li>details of any <a href="/claim-tax-credits/what-counts-as-income" title="What benefits to include">benefits</a> you get</li>
  <li>details of any childcare payments </li>
</ul>
<h2>Where to send the form</h2>

<p>The address is on the form. If you claim benefits you can give it to your Jobcentre Plus, or Social Security Office if you live in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>Penalties</h2>

<p>You may be charged a penalty (up to £3,000) if you give wrong information: </p>

<ul>
<li>fraudulently (on purpose)</li>
  <li>negligently (you didn’t take enough care)</li>
</ul>
<p>You won’t get a penalty if you made a mistake but took reasonable care when making a claim.</p>

<h2>Get help with your application</h2>

<p>You’re sent guidance notes with your claim form. You can also get help from the Tax Credit Office, your benefits office or an organisation like <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk" title="Citizens Advice">Citizens Advice.</a> </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you want someone else to talk to the Tax Credit Office for you - you must <a href="/getting-help-with-your-tax-credits-claim" title="Claim tax credits on behalf of someone else">authorise them</a>.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="when-to-claim"><header><h1>Part 2: When to claim</h1>
  </header><h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Use the <a href="/tax-credits-calculator" title="Tax credits calculator">tax credits calculator</a> to check what you’re entitled to. </p>

<h2>Deadlines</h2>

<p>You can claim tax credits at any time of the year.</p>

<p>Usually, tax credits are <a href="/claim-tax-credits/backdate-a-claim" title="Backdated claims">backdated</a> by 1 month from the date of your claim. </p>

<p>Apply as soon as you know you’re eligible to get all the money you’re entitled to.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example: baby born 1 September</strong><br>
You claim tax credits on 1 January so your tax credits get backdated to 1 December.  </p>

<p>If you’d claimed them by 1 October you’d have been getting tax credits from 1 September.</p>
</div>

<h2>Applying if you’re not eligible</h2>

<p>If you know your income will drop to a level that means you qualify for tax credits they can be backdated to either: </p>

<ul>
<li>6 April - if your claim is received by 5 May </li>
  <li>1 month before your claim - if your claim is received after 5 May </li>
</ul>
<p>You might know your income is going to drop if, for example, you or your partner are being made redundant, leaving a job or taking a pay cut. </p>

<p>The income levels for <a href="/working-tax-credit" title="Working Tax Credit">Working Tax Credit</a> and <a href="/child-tax-credit" title="Child Tax Credit">Child Tax Credit</a> are different. </p>

</article><article id="joint-claims"><header><h1>Part 3: Joint claims</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for tax credits as a single person or as a couple (known as a ‘joint claim’). </p>

<p>You must make a joint claim if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re married or in a civil partnership</li>
  <li>you’re not permanently or legally separated </li>
  <li>you live with your partner as though you’re married or in a civil partnership</li>
  <li>you’re temporarily living away from your partner - eg to look after a relative</li>
  <li>your partner lives with you in the UK but works abroad </li>
  <li>you and your partner live abroad but work in the UK and don’t have children</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exception</h2>

<p>Claim as a single person if all the following apply: </p>

<ul>
<li>you regularly travel to or from the UK for work</li>
  <li>you don’t live in the UK </li>
  <li>you have no children </li>
  <li>your partner doesn’t work in the UK (if you have one)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you don’t make the right sort of application you must pay back any tax credits you’re not entitled to.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="backdate-a-claim"><header><h1>Part 4: Backdate a claim</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>When you make a claim your tax credits are backdated by 1 month.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to get tax credits backdated</h2>

<p>Usually, you don’t have to do anything - it happens automatically. The date they’re backdated to is shown on your award notice. </p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>You have to ask for your tax credits to be backdated if you get:</p>

<ul>
<li>Income Support </li>
  <li>Jobseeker’s Allowance (income-based) </li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (income-related) </li>
  <li>Pension Credit </li>
  <li>Working Tax Credit and you’re not claiming for any children </li>
</ul>
<p>To do this include a page with your claim form confirming: </p>

<ul>
<li>your name, address and National Insurance number </li>
  <li>the date you started work</li>
  <li>if you’re not in work - the date you started getting one of the benefits above </li>
</ul>
<h2>Backdating more than a month</h2>

<p>Claims can be backdated by more than a month if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you or your child start to get a disability benefit - eg Disability Living Allowance</li>
  <li>you start to get a sickness benefit - eg Statutory Sick Pay</li>
  <li>you get refugee status</li>
</ul>
<p>You must send your claim within 1 month of qualifying for the above. The Tax Credit Office will tell you how much more you’ll get. </p>

</article><article id="what-counts-as-income"><header><h1>Part 5: What counts as income</h1>
  </header><p>Usually, what you’re entitled to is based on your income for the last tax year (6 April 2011 to 5 April 2012). </p>

<p>Income includes: </p>

<ul>
<li>work - your earnings before tax and national insurance (check your P60 or payslips) </li>
  <li>certain benefits</li>
  <li>money from a pension - including your state pension</li>
  <li>interest on savings - if it’s more £300 a year</li>
  <li>your partner’s income - if you make a <a href="/claim-tax-credits/joint-claims" title="Joint claims">joint claim</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Income includes the money you get from state benefits but <strong>not</strong> the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Child Benefit</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit</li>
  <li>Council Tax Benefit</li>
  <li>Attendance Allowance</li>
  <li>Disability Living Allowance</li>
</ul>
<p>The guidance notes sent with your claim form tell you how to work out your income.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To support your claim, keep records about your income, bills, payslips, benefits, tax credits and child care.</p>
