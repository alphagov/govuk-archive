<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you trade goods within the EU and the value of either your sales or purchases exceeds the thresholds for the calendar year you must provide details on a monthly basis by returning Supplementary Declarations (SDs) to the Intrastat system.</p>

<p>Intrastat is a monitoring system giving essential information to the government about trade between EU member states. Any VAT registered business that has Arrivals (goods acquired from suppliers in other EU member states) or Dispatches (goods supplied to customers in other EU member states) with a value above the relevant threshold has to complete and submit SDs. Thresholds are reviewed annually and may change.</p>

<p>The Intrastat system only covers the movement of goods - services are not included except in very specific circumstances. This guide specifically covers SDs for Intrastat. Help and advice for supplying SDs for trade with non-EU countries is covered elsewhere on the site.</p>

<p>The information contained in this guide is detailed. For intermediate information, see our guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/intrastat-duty-to-report-statistics">Intrastat - reporting the value and volume of intra-EU trade </a> and for basic information see an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/introduction-to-intrastat">introduction to Intrastat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="intrastat-and-the-role-of-sds">Intrastat and the role of SDs</h2>

<p>Intrastat is a system used to keep accurate records of the UK’s trade with other EU member states.</p>

<p>If you’re VAT registered and trading goods with businesses or individuals in other EU member states and either your flow of Arrivals (goods acquired from within the EU) - or your flow of Dispatches (goods dispatched to other EU member states) pass either or both annual thresholds you must submit SDs for Intrastat.</p>

<p>The 2011 thresholds are £600,000 for Arrivals and £250,000 for Dispatches.</p>

<p>If you are trading goods with countries outside the EU you may need to complete customs declarations.</p>

<p>Data supplied on SDs is used to build an accurate picture of trade between EU member states. It’s used by the government to inform and improve economic policy. The data required to complete SDs is closely aligned with the information on your VAT returns - you will already be gathering much of the information required to discharge your VAT responsibilities.</p>

<h2 id="your-responsibilities-for-making-supplementary-declarations">Your responsibilities for making Supplementary Declarations</h2>

<p>You must submit SDs if the value of the goods you either bring in from or sell on to individuals or businesses in the EU exceeds the annual threshold.</p>

<p>The threshold is set for the calendar year. It is reviewed annually and may be subject to change. The 2011 thresholds remained at 2010 levels - £600,000 for Arrivals (goods acquired from other EU member states) and £250,000 for Dispatches (goods you send to customers in other EU member states).</p>

<p>You must submit SDs if the value of either your Arrivals or Dispatches exceeds the applicable threshold in the calendar year. If both your Arrivals and Dispatches exceed the thresholds, you must submit SDs for both.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that SDs are only required to record the movement of goods - the supply of services is excluded. SDs are required when goods over the threshold value are:</p>

<ul>
<li>bought and sold</li>
  <li>transferred between the same legal entity - such as subsidiary companies in different EU member states</li>
  <li>sent or returned after processing - such as components being shipped out and finished products being returned</li>
  <li>installed or used in construction</li>
  <li>on long-term hire or lease exceeding 24 months</li>
  <li>supplied free of charge - excluding commercial samples and promotional material</li>
  <li>supplied as part of a service contract - for example industrial cleaning equipment necessary to fulfil a cleaning contract in another member state</li>
  <li>lost or destroyed - if goods dispatched from the UK are lost or destroyed in transit they should be recorded on the supplementary declarations - this does not apply to arrivals</li>
</ul>
<p>When calculating the value of goods for SDs you must include any related freight or insurance charges where they form part of the invoice or contract price of the goods. You must also include any goods supplied free of charge. However, you must not include the value of any excise duty that may be payable. You must also exclude any freight and insurance costs not included in the contract price.</p>

<h3 id="submission-deadlines-and-threshold-calculations">Submission deadlines and threshold calculations</h3>

<p>You must submit SDs on a monthly basis. SDs usually cover a calendar month and you must submit your SDs by the end of the following month - ie the SDs for March must be submitted by the end of April. If you use special VAT accounting periods, your SDs can match but please refer to HM Revenue &amp; Customs Notice 60 for more information. </p>

<p>If your level of trade in goods with other EU member states reaches the threshold you must submit SDs from the first day of the month in which the threshold is exceeded. You must continue to submit SDs until the annual value of your trade falls below the next year’s threshold - usually announced in November each year. </p>

<p>Submitting accurate and timely SDs is a legal requirement. If you persistently file your data late or provide misleading or partial information, you may be prosecuted and fined.</p>

<h2 id="information-you-need-to-complete-sds-for-intrastat">Information you need to complete SDs for Intrastat</h2>

<p>To complete SDs you will need specific information to hand.</p>

<h3 id="business-information">Business information</h3>

<p>You will need your business name and address, VAT registration number and branch identifier if required. If an agent is submitting SDs on your behalf they’ll also need to supply their own matching information. You will also need your sales or purchase ledgers, invoices, and any other commercial documentation relating to the sale or purchase of goods for the month of return.</p>

<h3 id="period-covered">Period covered</h3>

<p>This is the calendar month - or the month most covered by the period if you’re using special VAT accounting periods. The period is the month and year (mmyy) to which the declaration refers - eg 0110 for January 2010. </p>

<h3 id="commodity-code">Commodity code</h3>

<p>You must classify your goods using the Intrastat Classification Nomenclature (<abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr>) codes. </p>

<p>It’s essential that you use the right classification codes. See the link to classifying your goods for SDs.</p>

<h3 id="value">Value</h3>

<p>The value of the goods covered by the <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr> must be included, rounded up to the nearest pound in the same way as your VAT return. You must not include duty or service charges that may have been included on the invoice. See the information on preparing SDs.</p>

<h3 id="nature-of-transaction-codes">Nature of Transaction Codes</h3>

<p>Special codes are used to signify what type of transaction you’re reporting. For example, a straightforward sale is signified by Nature of Transaction Code (<abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr>) 10 while credit notes are denoted by using <abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr> 16. </p>

<h3 id="weight-or-supplementary-units">Weight or supplementary units</h3>

<p>You must record the weight (net mass in kilograms) or a supplementary unit for each data line of goods. The required unit of measurement is defined by the commodity code. Only one measure is required.</p>

<h3 id="to-and-from-codes">To and from codes</h3>

<p>On SDs for Arrivals you must use the country code indicating the member state from where the goods have come. On the <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr> for Dispatches you must use the code for the member state to which you have sent the goods.</p>

<h3 id="delivery-terms">Delivery terms</h3>

<p>If the value of the goods you acquire or supply exceeds £16 million annually you will also have to record the delivery terms on your SDs.</p>

<h2 id="classifying-your-goods-for-sds">Classifying your goods for SDs</h2>

<p>When reporting your Arrivals and Dispatches on SDs you must use the <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> - a set of commodity codes that specifies the type of goods in which you’re trading.</p>

<p>Commodity codes comprise eight digits, with each pair of digits added from left to right adding more detail to the description. The first two digits signify a broad product category, the second pair of digits are a subdivision of that category, and so on. </p>

<h3 id="getting-the-right-codes">Getting the right codes</h3>

<p>There are a number of methods you can use to find your goods’ commodity codes. You can use the <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> Online service from uktradeinfo. You can browse or search the database of codes and keep a list of ‘favourites’ for regularly used codes. The service is free. <a rel="external" href="https://www.uktradeinfo.com/TradeTools/ICN/Pages/ICNSearch.aspx">Find out about <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> Online on the uktradeinfo website</a>. </p>

<h3 id="help-and-advice-on-classification">Help and advice on classification</h3>

<p>While the <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> system is detailed, there may be circumstances when it’s not easy to achieve a perfect match for your goods to a particular classification. If you’re not sure you can call the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Tariff Classification Service enquiry line on 01702 366 077. You can get advice on a maximum of three different types of goods in each call. It’s worth having detailed information to hand when you call so the advice can be as accurate as possible.</p>

<p>In some cases, you may find it useful to obtain Binding Tariff Information (<abbr title="Binding Tariff Information">BTI</abbr>). This is a document that establishes - for six years - a commodity code within which a specific type of goods fall. It’s binding across the EU and cannot be transferred to another holder. If the classification for your goods is unclear, holding <abbr title="Binding Tariff Information">BTI</abbr> can save you time and money. The service is free although you will have to bear the costs of any laboratory work or expert research required to finalise the document. For further information on how to get <abbr title="Binding Tariff Information">BTI</abbr> see the information on classification of goods.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-sds">Preparing SDs</h2>

<p>There are two types of <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr> - C1500 for Arrivals and C1501 for Dispatches. If the value of your Arrivals (goods coming into the UK) or your Dispatches (goods leaving the UK) exceeds the Intrastat threshold you need to submit an Arrivals or Dispatches <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr>, as appropriate. If both Arrivals and Dispatches exceed the threshold you need to submit both an Arrivals and a Dispatches <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr>.</p>

<p>The 2011 thresholds were £600,000 for Arrivals and £250,000 for Dispatches.</p>

<p>You will need to classify your goods according to the <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> in order to complete your SDs. </p>

<h3 id="calculating-the-value">Calculating the value</h3>

<p>The calculation of the value of your goods is an essential step in preparing your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr>. Using International Commercial Contracts (Incoterms) to describe the basis of the transaction will help define the value you need to declare.</p>

<p>For example, if you’re supplying goods free on board you should only declare the value of the goods and the cost of transport to the port of departure. If you’re supplying goods delivered duty paid, you should include the value of the goods and the costs incurred in delivering the goods to the specified destination.</p>

<p>If the annual value of your flow of Dispatches or Arrivals exceeds £16 million you will also have to report the delivery terms on your SDs for that section of the flow which exceeds £16 million.</p>

<p>It’s essential to remember that you must not include any excise duty in your value calculations. To read about the goods for which you must return SDs see the information on your responsibilities for making SDs.</p>

<h3 id="transaction-codes">Transaction codes</h3>

<p>You will also need to have a Nature of Transaction Code (<abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr>) ready to complete your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr>. An <abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr> defines what type of transaction you’re reporting. NOTCs are also used to reconcile returns following replacements of goods or credit notes being issued. The most common NoTCs are:</p>

<ul>
<li>10: denoting a sale or purchase</li>
  <li>30: denoting a change of ownership of the goods at no charge</li>
  <li>40: denoting goods sent for processing</li>
  <li>50: denotes goods returned from processing</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr> 40 and 50 can only be used when the goods sent for processing from the UK are returned to the UK (not necessarily to the company which originally dispatched the goods).</p>

<h3 id="weight-or-supplementary-unit">Weight or supplementary unit</h3>

<p>You will need to record either the weight (net mass) or a supplementary unit for the consignment. The <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> commodity code you use will define which measurement is required for your goods.</p>

<h3 id="destination-or-origin">Destination or origin</h3>

<p>You will also need to indicate which EU member state the goods have come from or are going to in the form of a two-letter code.</p>

<h2 id="submitting-sds-for-intrastat">Submitting SDs for Intrastat</h2>

<p>You can submit SDs in paper or electronic form. It’s a good idea to use the electronic services as they can save you time and money.</p>

<h3 id="submitting-sds-online">Submitting SDs online</h3>

<p>Online you can either fill in the form or upload the data from a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file you have prepared, or use the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).</p>

<p>You can find out about completing the online form, uploading data files for SDs and using EDI to submit your SDs in the information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/intrastat-technology-and-technicalities">Intrastat - technology and technicalities</a>.</p>

<h3 id="using-paper-forms">Using paper forms</h3>

<p>If you prefer, you can submit paper forms. However, this method is more time consuming and crucial information may be omitted accidentally. It’s better to use the electronic services.</p>

<p>If you wish to use the paper forms you must fill in form C1500 for your Arrivals and form C1501 for Dispatches. You can access these forms to complete paper returns from the links below:</p>

<h2 id="advice-on-complex-transactions-under-the-intrastat-system">Advice on complex transactions under the Intrastat system</h2>

<p>While the reporting requirements for Intrastat are simple there are occasions where the nature of your business may mean your responsibilities are more complex - such as when your VAT accounting periods don’t align with calendar months or goods have been returned.</p>

<h3 id="location-of-goods">Location of goods</h3>

<p>The movement of your goods is the most important element in completing your SDs correctly. For example, if you buy goods from a customer in Spain but the goods are dispatched from Germany you should record those Arrivals as coming from Germany rather than Spain. This is known as triangulation.</p>

<h3 id="errors-credit-notes-and-retrospective-discounts">Errors, credit notes and retrospective discounts</h3>

<p>Sometimes you will have to issue credit notes or discounts after your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr> for the period has been submitted. When this happens you need to add a balancing entry to your next return covering the credit. To do so using the electronic service you must use the first digit of the <abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr> followed by a ‘6’. This will indicate to the system that it’s a minus value and will balance your records accordingly.</p>

<p>A similar principle is followed if an adjustment needs to be made as a result of a change in trading terms or goods being returned, such as goods shipped and not paid for or the receipt of stage payments. Further information on this can be found in section 7.2 of HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) Notice 60. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000267&amp;propertyType=document">Read Notice 60 Intrastat general guide on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>However, you must not use NoTCs to amend errors on your SDs. If you find an error, you must supply an additional declaration for that period.</p>

<h3 id="customs-processes">Customs processes</h3>

<p>If your goods are entered into customs processes this will have an impact on your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr> reporting.</p>

<p>If your goods move into customs warehouses or Free Zones do not record them for Intrastat. If the goods are brought into free circulation and then move to another EU member state an Intrastat report will be required. This also applies to goods moved between excise warehouses in different member states. Goods moving between excise warehouses within the UK should not be reported for Intrastat.</p>

<p>For goods going into an excise warehouse in the UK from another member state there are different rules depending on whether the goods are for retail distribution or are to be further processed.</p>

<p>If your goods are covered by Inward Processing (<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>) suspension and are moving under Community Transit procedures you do not include them on your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr>. If both you and the company in the other member state are approved by their respective customs authorities to use the simplified procedure for <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> suspension goods the movements should be reported on the <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can find further information about the arrangements for goods in customs processes in sections 17.1 to 17.4 of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Notice 60. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000267&amp;propertyType=document">Read Notice 60 Intrastat general guide on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="other-detailed-information">Other detailed information</h3>

<p>The uktradeinfo website has detailed information for other special situations, such as the position for leasing and hire of goods, progress and stage payments and goods on sale or return. </p>

<p>If your query isn’t covered, other detailed information is available in Notice 60 which provides detail about all your Intrastat obligations.</p>

<h2 id="supplementary-declaration-record-keeping-and-the-intrastat">Supplementary Declaration record keeping and the Intrastat</h2>

<p>You must keep specific paperwork when completing and filing SDs.</p>

<h3 id="key-documents">Key documents</h3>

<p>You must retain a copy of every <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr> you submit - or an agent submits on your behalf - and all papers and documents used to compile your SDs for at least six years.</p>

<p>You can keep these documents in an electronic format, provided it can be read by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>..</p>

<h3 id="inspections">Inspections</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> carries out inspections from time to time to ensure that businesses are complying with their Intrastat obligations. The visit is almost always to your premises even if you use an agent. When the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> representative visits they’ll need access to all your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SD</abbr>-related paperwork, so it’s advisable to keep your records organised.</p>

<h3 id="day-to-day-management">Day-to-day management</h3>

<p>In most cases, managing your Intrastat responsibilities will be comparatively simple. It’s prudent to check your SDs against your VAT return to see if the figures tally.</p>

<p>Any differences between your VAT returns and SDs may be queried by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, although <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> understands that circumstances - such as credit notes - may create a discrepancy between the SDs and the VAT return.</p>

<p>Check Notice 60, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s guide to Intrastat - for more detailed guidance on inspections and day-to-day management of your Intrastat responsibilities. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000267&amp;propertyType=document">Read Notice 60 Intrastat general guide on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>
