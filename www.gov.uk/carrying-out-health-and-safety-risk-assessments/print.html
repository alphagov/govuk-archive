</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>A risk assessment identifies how accidents, injuries or illness could be caused by your business - and shows you how to reduce the chances of them happening.</p>

<p>You must carry out a health and safety risk assessment if:</p>

<ul>
<li>people work for you</li>
  <li>you work for yourself but other people, like customers or suppliers, visit your workplace</li>
</ul>
<h2>How risk assessments work</h2>

<p>There are 5 steps to a risk assessment:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Identify hazards - the things in your business that could cause harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand your risks - who could be harmed by your hazards, and how.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take precautions against risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write down what you’ve done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review and update your risk assessment regularly or when things change in your business.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you have 5 or more employees, you must record the risk assessment in writing.</p>
</div>

<p>You can use the Health and Safety Executive’s <a href="write-down-your-risk-assessment" title="Risk assessment tools and templates">online tools, templates and examples</a> to help.</p>

<p>You don’t need to remove every single risk - but you must do everything you reasonably can to minimise them.</p>

<h2>Fire hazards</h2>

<p>If you’re working in commercial premises, you must do a <a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/fire/firesafety/firesafetylaw/aboutguides/" title="Fire safety and risk assessment">fire risk assessment.</a>. </p>

<p>You can a fire risk assessment as part of your health and safety risk assessment, or you can do it separately.</p>

<p>There are different rules for <a rel="external" href="http://firelawscotland.org/v23323.html?pContentID=240" title="Fire safety and risk assessment in Scotland">fire risk assessments in Scotland.</a></p>

</article><article id="identify-hazards"><header><h1>Part 2: Identify hazards</h1>
  </header><p>A hazard is anything that could cause harm. For example, it could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>the way you need to do something (working on a ladder, working without supervision)</li>
  <li>something about your premises (rain making the entrance to your premises slippery, stock stored on high shelves)</li>
  <li>something your business uses (machinery, equipment, chemicals)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to identify hazards</h2>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask your employees about the hazards that they see when they’re working</li>
  <li>check what may cause a hazard by walking round your premises and taking notes</li>
  <li>ask your trade association - they often have industry-specific guidelines for managing hazards for your type of business</li>
  <li>check safety instructions and data sheets for equipment or chemicals you use in your business - they will tell you what some of the hazards are </li>
  <li>review your accident and ill-health records for the causes of previous incidents</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get guidance on hazards and risk assessments for <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/industry.htm" title="Risk assessments for specific types of business">your type of business</a> from the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

<p>In Scotland, you can get workplace health and safety advice from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/industry.htm" title="Occupational health and safety advice in Scotland">‘Healthy working lives’ service.</a></p>

</article><article id="understand-your-risks"><header><h1>Part 3: Understand your risks</h1>
  </header><p>Once you’ve identified hazards, you must work out: </p>

<ul>
<li>what kind of incidents could happen</li>
  <li>who could be harmed by them</li>
</ul>
<p>These are your business’s risks.</p>

<p>For example, if you’ve identified as a hazard: </p>

<ul>
<li>‘lifting boxes of stock’ - the risk could be people in your warehouse damaging their backs</li>
  <li>‘rainwater making the floor around the shop doorway slippery’ - the risk could be staff and customers falling over</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve worked out all your business’s risks, you must ask people you employ for their views - they may think of something that you’ve missed.</p>

<h2>People with special safety needs</h2>

<p>You must also think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/youngpeople/index.htm" title="Advice on health and safety for young people">young workers</a> who may not be used to thinking about health and safety at work</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/migrantworkers" title="Advice on health and safety for migrant workers">migrant workers</a> who may have different attitudes to health and safety or speak different languages</li>
  <li>new or expectant <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/mothers" title="Advice on health and safety for new and expecting mothers">mothers</a>
</li>
  <li>people with <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/disability/risk.htm" title="Advice on health and safety for people with disabilities">disabilities</a>
</li>
  <li>people who may not be in your workplace all the time (like cleaners, visitors, freelancers or homeworkers)</li>
</ul></article><article id="take-precautions-against-risks"><header><h1>Part 4: Take precautions against risks</h1>
  </header><p>Once you’ve identified your business’s risks, you must do everything reasonable to avoid people being harmed by them.</p>

<p>You should try to eliminate risks if possible. For example, you should manufacture your product without using dangerous chemicals if you can. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You don’t need to try to do everything at once - but you should handle the biggest risks first and give yourself target dates to complete everything.</p>
</div>

<p>If it’s going to take you a while to arrange a permanent solution for a major risk, you should make short-term arrangements to reduce the risk as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>When you can’t completely remove a risk</h2>

<p>You should consider what you can do to reduce the risk, if possible in the order below:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Try a less risky option - for example, you could use a chemical that’s less dangerous instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep people away from the hazard - for example, you could put barriers around a furnace so people can’t accidentally get too close.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organise work so it keeps away from a hazard  - for example, print shops should keep guillotines at the end of production lines, not halfway through them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give staff and visitors protective equipment, like glasses, goggles, footwear or protective clothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide facilities to deal with problems, for example you could put first aid boxes close to hazards or provide washing facilities to reduce contamination risks.</p>
</li>
</ol></article><article id="write-down-your-risk-assessment"><header><h1>Part 5: Write down your risk assessment</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you employ 5 or more people, you must keep a written record of your risk assessment.</p>
</div>

<p>You don’t have to record your risk assessment in any particular way, but you can make it easier by using the Health and Safety Executive’s (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
<li>online risk assessment tool for <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/office.htm" title="Risk assessment tool for offices">offices</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/shop.htm" title="Risk assessment tool for shops">shops</a> </li>

<p>You can download a risk assessment template from the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>.</p>

</div>


</article><article id="review-and-update-your-risk-assessment"><header><h1>Part 6: Review and update your risk assessment</h1>
  </header><p>There’s no set deadline for you to review or update a health and safety risk assessment. </p>

<p>But you should do it regularly - many businesses review their risk assessments once a year. </p>

<p>You should also update it when things change in your business, eg you move premises, start using new chemicals or buy new equipment.</p>
