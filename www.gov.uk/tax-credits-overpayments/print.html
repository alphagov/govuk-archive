  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overpayments"><header><h1>Part 1: Overpayments</h1>
  </header><p>You have to repay any tax credits you’re not entitled to. Overpayments happen if: </p>

<ul>
<li>you don’t report a change in your circumstance to the Tax Credit Office </li>
  <li>you make a mistake on your claim form </li>
</ul>
<p>The Tax Credit Office will tell you what you owe and how to repay it. Overpayments can be repaid:</p>

<ul>
<li>by reducing your tax credits</li>
  <li>through your tax code - if you owe less than £3,000</li>
  <li>as a lump sum</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you owe less than £3,000</h2>

<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs can change your <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax code to collect your overpayment. You’ll pay back what you owe by paying more tax in the next tax year (6 April).</p>

<p>This only happens if:</p>

<ul>
<li>your overpayment is less than £3,000</li>
  <li>you work for an employer, or get a UK-based pension</li>
  <li>you haven’t contacted the Tax Credit Office about repaying the overpayment</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making extra payments</h2>

<p>If you want to make extra payments to clear the debt more quickly - call the Tax Credit Payment Helpline.</p>
