You contact an adoption agency - it will send you information about their adoption process.\r\ns2. The agency arranges to meet you - you may also be invited to a meeting with other people wanting to adopt a child.\r\ns3. If you and the agency agree to carry on, the agency will give you an application form.\r\n\r\n^The time it takes to adopt can vary - but it normally takes at least 8 months.^","slug":"early-stages-of-adoption","title":"Early stages of adoption"}},{"table":{"body":"Once the agency gets your application it will:\r\n\r\ns1. Invite you to a series of preparation classes - these are normally held locally and give advice on the effect adoption may have on you.\r\ns2. Arrange for a social worker to visit you on several occasions to carry out an assessment - this is to check you're suitable to become an adoptive parent.\r\ns3. Arrange a police check - you will not be allowed to adopt if you, or an \u2028adult member of your family have been convicted of a serious offence, eg \u2028against a child.\r\ns4. Arrange to get personal references from your employer or ex-employer(s).\r\ns4. Talk to people who know you well - like relatives and neighbours. \r\ns5. Arrange for you to have a full medical examination.  \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n##Your assessment\r\nThe social worker will send the assessment report to an independent adoption panel. If there's an adoption panel meeting, you can go along to ask questions and answer any questions the panel have. \r\n\r\nThe adoption panel will send its recommendation to the agency, which will then make the decision whether you're suitable to adopt a child.\r\n\r\n##If you can adopt a child\r\nOnce your agency decides you can adopt, it will begin the process of finding a child for you to adopt. \r\n\r\nIf a match isn't found after 3 months, the agency can refer you to the [Adoption Register for England and Wales.](http://www.adoptionregister.org.uk/site/page.aspx?pid=48 \"Adoption Register for England and Wales\"){:rel=\"external\"} \r\n\r\nThe Register holds details of children across England and Wales who need adopting.\r\n\r\n##If an adoption agency says you can't adopt\r\nIf you disagree with an adoption agency\u2019s decision, you can either:\r\n\r\n- challenge their decision by writing to the agency\r\n- apply to the [Independent Review Mechanism](http://www.independentreviewmechanism.org.uk/ \"Independent Review Mechanism\"){:rel=\"external\"} which will look into your case\r\n\r\nYou can also contact other adoption agencies - but you will have to start the process again.\r\n\r\n","slug":"adoption-assessment","title":"Adoption assessment"}},{"table":{"body":"To make an adoption legal, you need to apply for an adoption court order.
