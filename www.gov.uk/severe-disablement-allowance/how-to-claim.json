Jobcentre Plus will review your SDA claim to check if you\u2019re capable of work or can get [Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)](/employment-support-allowance \"Employment and Support Allowance\") instead.\r\n\r\nYour benefit claim will not be reviewed if:\r\n\r\n- you're already getting ESA\r\n- you are due to reach State Pension age before 6 April 2014\r\n\r\n##How your claim will be reviewed##\r\n\r\nJobcentre Plus will write to you when your benefit claim is going to be reviewed. Not everyone will be contacted at the same time. This process started in October 2010 and is expected to be completed in 2014.\r\n\r\n###Questionnaire###\r\n\r\nJobcentre Plus will send you a questionnaire to complete. This questionnaire will ask about how your long term health condition or disability affects your ability to complete everyday tasks.\r\n\r\nYou must complete this questionnaire with as much detail as possible and return it by the date requested. If you do not, your benefit claim may be affected.\r\n\r\n###Work Capability Assessment###\r\n\r\nThe information you give will be used to decide if you need to attend a face-to-face assessment. This is called Work Capability Assessment. This assessment will help find out:\r\n\r\n- what you're able to do\r\n- whether you might be capable of work\r\n\r\nIf you're asked to attend an assessment, you must go and take part fully. If you don't, your benefit claim may be affected.\r\n\r\n##If the review finds that you're capable of working##\r\n\r\nIf the assessment finds that you're capable of working, Jobcentre Plus will call you. They will discuss what benefits you might be able to claim, eg Jobseeker's Allowance. They will also write to you.\r\n\r\n##If the review finds you're entitled to ESA## \r\n\r\nIf you're entitled to ESA, Jobcentre Plus will call you to let you know. They will also write to you.\r\n\r\nYour SDA claim will be transferred automatically to ESA. There will be no break in the payments you get.\r\n\r\nDepending on how severe your disability or health condition is, you will be placed in one of two groups:\r\n\r\n- Work Related Activity Group\r\n- Support Group\r\n\r\n###Work Related Activity Group###\r\n\r\nIf you're placed in the Work Related Activity Group, you will get support to help you prepare for suitable work.\r\n\r\nYour benefit may be affected if you don't take part in the work-related support.\r\n\r\n###Support Group###\r\n\r\nIf you are severely disabled or have the most severe health conditions you will be placed in the Support Group. You will not be expected to look for work and will get the extra support you need.\r\n\r\nYou will not have to take up any work-related support unless you want to.\r\n\r\n##If your circumstances change##\r\n\r\nTell [Jobcentre Plus](http://los.direct.gov.uk/default.aspx?type=2&lang=en \"contact Jobcentre Plus\"){:rel=\"external\"} if your circumstances change. Some examples of the changes you need to report include:\r\n\r\n- doing any work, including voluntary work\r\n- starting training and getting a training allowance\r\n- changing your address\r\n- going abroad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*[SDA]: Severe Disablement Allowance\r\n*[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance","slug":"further-information","title":"Further information"}}],"type":"programme"}
