</ul>
<p>You need to tell the <a href="/contact-the-tax-credit-office" title="Contact the Tax Credit Office">Tax Credit Office</a> if any of the above apply so that your child continues to get payments.</p>

</article><article id="education"><header><h1>Part 2: Full-time education</h1>
  </header><p>You can get Child Tax Credit until your child turns 20 if they’re in eligible education. They must be accepted onto the course before they turn 19.</p>

<h2>Courses that count</h2>

<p>Education must be full-time (more than an average of 12 hours’ supervised study a week) and ‘non-advanced’. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>GCSEs</li>
  <li>A levels</li>
  <li>NVQ/SVQ level 1, 2 or 3</li>
  <li>BTEC National Diploma, National Certificate and First Diploma</li>
  <li>SCE higher grade or similar</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t include ‘advanced’ education, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>a degree</li>
  <li>Diploma of Higher Education </li>
  <li>NVQ level 4 or above</li>
  <li>BTEC Higher National Certificate (HNC) or Higher National Diploma (HND)</li>
  <li>teacher training</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Courses are not eligible if they’re provided by the child’s employer or provided through an office the child holds - eg the education is part of their role as a scout leader.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="training"><header><h1>Part 3: Approved training courses</h1>
  </header><p>You can still get Child Tax Credit up to your child’s 20th birthday if they are on an approved course that:</p>

<ul>
<li>is unpaid</li>
  <li>teaches them skills needed to do a job</li>
</ul>
<p>Your child needs to have started, enrolled or been accepted onto an approved course before their 19th birthday. </p>

<p>Approved courses are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Foundation Learning Programmes (or ‘Entry to Employment’)</li>
  <li>Get Ready for Work (including West Lothian Council’s Skills Training Programme)</li>
  <li>Skillbuild/Skillbuild+ (if started before 1 August 2011)</li>
  <li>Skillseekers</li>
  <li>Jobskills</li>
  <li>Training for Success: Professional and Technical Training</li>
  <li>Traineeships</li>
  <li>Foundation Apprenticeships</li>
  <li>Access to Apprenticeships (or unwaged Programme Led Apprenticeships)</li>
  <li>Programme Led Apprenticeships (Apprenticeships NI)</li>
</ul>
<p>A course provided by an employer as part of a job <strong>doesn’t count as approved</strong> eg Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland.</p>


</article><article id="breaks-in-education-or-training"><header><h1>Part 4: Breaks in education or training</h1>
  </header><p>You may get Child Tax Credit for 6 months if the break is for a good reason eg your child is changing course or pregnant.</p>

<p>You may be able to get Child Tax Credit for longer than 6 months if your child’s full-time education is interrupted because of illness or disability.</p>

<h2>Voluntary breaks</h2>

<p>You can’t normally get Child Tax Credit if your child has taken a voluntary break in education or training, eg if they travel overseas for personal reasons.</p>

<h2>After the break</h2>

<p>If your child goes back to education or training after a break, you should <a href="/child-tax-credit/how-to-claim" title="claim Child Tax Credit">make a new claim</a>.</p>

<div class="advisory">
<p><strong>If your child doesn’t go back into eligible education or training, you may have to pay back some of the payments you got during the break.</strong></p>
</div>

</article><article id="your-child-leaves-education-or-training"><header><h1>Part 5: Your child leaves education or training</h1>
  </header><p>If your child leaves education or training your Child Tax Credits will stop. You can get them paid for an extra 20 weeks if they register with their local careers service or Connexions (and also the Education or Library Board in Northern Ireland). </p>

<p>You’ll also get the extra credits if they registered with a similar organisation in the European Economic Area or join the Armed Forces. </p>
