  </header><p>You must apply to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) for permission if you supply new large goods trailers for use on the road.</p>

<p>This is called a ‘letter of consent’ and applies to <a href="/permission-to-supply-a-large-goods-trailer-for-use-on-the-road/who-needs-permission" title="more details on who needs permission">‘final suppliers’</a>. </p>

<p>You need a letter of consent for any new trailers that the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1988/1478/contents/made" title="Goods Vehicle (Plating and Testing) Regulations">Goods Vehicle (Plating and Testing) Regulations</a> apply to.</p>


</article><article id="who-needs-permission"><header><h1>Part 2: Who needs permission</h1>
  </header><p>You need to get permission if you’re a ‘final supplier’ of trailers. Final suppliers are: </p>

<ul>
<li>trailer manufacturers</li>
  <li>trailer dealers</li>
  <li>importers of new trailers</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re a dealer or importer, you only have to get permission if it hasn’t already been obtained (eg if the trailer was built abroad, and the manufacturer did not apply).</p>
</div>

<p>When you need to get permission depends on when the trailer was manufactured.</p>

<p>It’s an offence to supply or use these trailers without getting permission first and you could be fined.</p>
