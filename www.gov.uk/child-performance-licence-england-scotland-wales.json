performance, sporting event or modelling assignment.","licence_overview":"You need a licence from your local authority to pay a child to work at: \r\n\r\n* a public performance (such as film, play or musical)\r\n* a sporting event\r\n* a modelling assignment that you are organising and for which the child will be paid\r\n\r\nA public performance includes:\r\n\r\n* any show for which an admission fee or other charge is made\r\n* any show which takes place on licensed premises\r\n* any production which is being filmed, broadcast or recorded for public exhibition\r\n\r\nA child includes any person who has not yet reached compulsory school leaving age.\r\n\r\nYou don't need a licence if the child is not being paid to take part in the performance, eg in the case of a school play.\r\n\r\nYou will usually need to complete an application form providing details of:\r\n\r\n* your business\r\n* the production, sporting event or modelling assignment and the child's part in it\r\n* times, dates and duration of performances or activities\r\n* number of days and hours per day that the child will appear in the performances or activities (including rehearsals)\r\n* what the child will earn\r\n* arrangements that you will make for the child in relation to, eg schooling and chaperoning\r\n\r\nYou will also need to provide:\r\n\r\n* a statement by the child's parents in support of the application (this may be part of the application form)\r\n* the child's birth certificate or other evidence of age\r\n* two identical prints of a photograph of the child taken during the previous six months\r\n* a copy of the contract, draft contract or other documents containing details of the agreement regulating the child's appearance in the performance or the activity for which the licence is required\r\n* a letter from the child's school authorising their absence\r\n* a declaration, where the child is under 14 years of age, that the part they are acting or dancing can only be taken by a child of approximately the same age\r\n\r\nAn application fee is generally not payable.\r\n\r\nYou should apply at least 21 days before the performance or activity is due to start.\r\n\r\nThe local authority may interview you, the child and the child's parents during the process of determining your application and may request that the child is medically examined to ensure they are fit to participate.\r\n\r\nIf your application is granted, you will be issued a licence specifying the arrangements for the child to take part in the performance or activity.\r\n\r\n##Conditions\r\n\r\nLicences will be subject to a number of conditions.\r\n\r\nFor example:  \r\n\r\n* the number of days the child can be expected to perform \r\n* getting a matron/chaperone and for the child's education during the term of the licence.\r\n\r\nPremises where performances or rehearsals are to take place must be approved by the local authority to ensure they are suitable for children.\r\n\r\nYou will also be required to keep detailed records relating to the performance or activity and produce these for inspection on request.\r\n\r\n##Fines and penalties\r\n\r\n% If you allow a child to take part in an unlicensed performance, or fail to comply with any conditions attached to your licence, you are committing an offence and may be fined up to \u00a31,000, imprisoned for up to three months or both.%","updated_at":"2012-10-02T12:12:22+00:00"}],["tags",[{"title":"Recruiting and
