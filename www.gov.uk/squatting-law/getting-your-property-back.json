","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"Simply being on another person\u2019s property without their permission is not usually a crime. But if squatters commit other crimes when entering or staying in a property, the police can take action against them.\r\n\r\nThese crimes could include:\r\n\r\n+ causing damage when entering the property\r\n+ causing damage while in the property\r\n+ not leaving when the owner of the property asks them to (if it's a residential property)\r\n+ not leaving when they're told to by a court\r\n+ stealing from the property\r\n+ using utilities like electricity or gas without permission\r\n+ making a lot of noise or fly-tipping\r\n\r\n##Squatters' rights\r\nThere's a law that makes it illegal to threaten or use violence to enter a property with people in it. The law was introduced to stop landlords using violence to evict their tenants.\r\n\r\nHowever, this law doesn\u2019t apply to a [displaced residential occupier](where-to-get-help \"Where to get help\") or a [protected intending occupier](where-to-get-help \"Where to get help\"). This means that if you break down the door of your own home where you're living, you aren't committing a crime. \r\n\r\nYou may have to prove you're a displaced residential occupier or protected intending occupier if the police are called.\r\n\r\n##Squatters taking ownership of a property\r\nIt's difficult and very rare for squatters to take ownership of a property. To do this, they would have to stay in a property without the owner\u2019s permission for at least 10 years.\r\n","slug":"squatting-and-squatters-rights","title":"Squatting and squatters' rights"}},{"table":{"body":"##Getting an interim possession order\r\nIf you own or occupy the property that has been squatted, you can use an interim possession order (IPO) to get your property back quickly.
