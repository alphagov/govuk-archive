  <p>Notes</p>

  </header><div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Squatting in residential buildings (like a house or flat) is illegal. It can lead to 6 months in prison, a £5,000 fine, or both.</p>
</div>

<p>Squatting is when someone knowingly enters a residential building as a trespasser and lives there, or intends to live there. </p>

<p>A tenant who enters a property with the permission of the landlord, but who falls behind with rent payments, is <strong>not</strong> a squatter. </p>

<p>Although <a href="/squatting-law/squatting-in-nonresidential-properties" title="Squatting and the law (Squatting in non-residential properties)">squatting a non-residential building or land</a> isn’t in itself a crime, trespassers on non-residential property may be committing other crimes.</p>

<p>It’s normally a crime for a person to enter private property without permission and refuse to leave when the owner asks. </p>

<p>In certain circumstances, it may also be a crime if someone doesn’t leave land when they’ve been directed to do so by the police or council, or if they don’t comply with a repossession order.</p>


</article><article id="squatting-in-nonresidential-properties"><header><h1>Part 2: Squatting in non-residential properties</h1>
  </header><p>A non-residential property is any building or land that isn’t designed to be lived in. </p>

<p>Simply being on another person’s non-residential property without their permission is not usually a crime. But if squatters commit other crimes when entering or staying in a property, the police can take action against them.</p>

<p>These crimes could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>causing damage when entering the property</li>
  <li>causing damage while in the property</li>
  <li>not leaving when they’re told to by a court</li>
  <li>stealing from the property</li>
  <li>using utilities like electricity or gas without permission</li>
  <li>fly-tipping</li>
  <li>not complying with a noise abatement notice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting your non-residential property back</h2>
<p>If you own the property that has been squatted, you can use an interim possession order (<abbr title="Interim possession order">IPO</abbr>) to get your property back quickly. </p>

<h3>Court action</h3>
<p>If you follow the right procedure, you can usually get one issued by the courts within a few days.</p>

<p>To get final possession of the property, you must also make an application for possession when you apply for the <abbr title="Interim possession order">IPO</abbr>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use <a href="http://hmctscourtfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=379" title="Form N130: Application for possession including for interim possession order" rel="external">form N130</a> to apply for an interim possession order and for possession.</p>
</div>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>You can’t use an <abbr title="Interim possession order">IPO</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re also making a claim for damages caused by the squatters - instead you can make an ordinary claim for possession </li>
  <li>more than 28 days have passed since you found out about the squatters</li>
  <li>you’re trying to evict former tenants, sub-tenants or licensees - instead see <a href="/private-renting-evictions" title="Private renting: evictions">Private renting: evictions</a> or <a href="/council-housing-association-evictions" title="Council and housing association evictions">Council and housing association evictions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once squatters are served with an <abbr title="Interim possession order">IPO</abbr>, they must leave the property within 24 hours. If they don’t, they’re committing a crime and could serve up to 6 months in prison. </p>

<p>It’s also a crime for them to return to the property within 12 months.</p>

<h2>Squatters taking ownership of a property</h2>
<p>It’s difficult and very rare for squatters to take ownership of a property. To do this, they would have to stay in a property without the owner’s permission for at least 10 years.</p>

  </header><h2>If you’re squatting</h2>
<p>If you’re squatting, you may be classed as homeless.

<h2>To report squatters</h2>
