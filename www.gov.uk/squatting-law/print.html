  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Squatting is when someone enters and occupies an empty or abandoned property that they don’t own or rent, without the owner’s permission.</p>

<p>A tenant who enters a property with the permission of the landlord, but who falls behind with rent payments, is <strong>not</strong> a squatter. </p>

<p>Although squatting isn’t illegal, it’s normally a crime for a person to enter someone’s home without permission and refuse to leave when the owner asks. </p>

</article><article id="squatting-and-squatters-rights"><header><h1>Part 2: Squatting and squatters' rights</h1>
  </header><p>Simply being on another person’s property without their permission is not usually a crime. But if squatters commit other crimes when entering or staying in a property, the police can take action against them.</p>

<p>These crimes could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>causing damage when entering the property</li>
  <li>causing damage while in the property</li>
  <li>not leaving when the owner of the property asks them to (if it’s a residential property)</li>
  <li>not leaving when they’re told to by a court</li>
  <li>stealing from the property</li>
  <li>using utilities like electricity or gas without permission</li>
  <li>making a lot of noise or fly-tipping</li>
</ul>
<h2>Squatters’ rights</h2>
<p>There’s a law that makes it illegal to threaten or use violence to enter a property with people in it. The law was introduced to stop landlords using violence to evict their tenants.</p>

<p>However, this law doesn’t apply to a <a href="where-to-get-help" title="Where to get help">displaced residential occupier</a> or a <a href="where-to-get-help" title="Where to get help">protected intending occupier</a>. This means that if you break down the door of your own home where you’re living, you aren’t committing a crime. </p>

<p>You may have to prove you’re a displaced residential occupier or protected intending occupier if the police are called.</p>

<h2>Squatters taking ownership of a property</h2>
<p>It’s difficult and very rare for squatters to take ownership of a property. To do this, they would have to stay in a property without the owner’s permission for at least 10 years.</p>

</article><article id="getting-your-property-back"><header><h1>Part 3: Getting your property back</h1>
  </header><h2>Getting an interim possession order</h2>
<p>If you own or occupy the property that has been squatted, you can use an interim possession order (<abbr title="Interim possession order">IPO</abbr>) to get your property back quickly. If you follow the right procedure, you can usually get one issued by the courts within a few days.</p>

<p>To get final possession of the property, you must also make an application for possession when you apply for the <abbr title="Interim possession order">IPO</abbr>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use <a href="http://hmctscourtfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=379" title="Form N130: Application for possession including for interim possession order" rel="external">form N130</a> to apply for an interim possession order and for possession.</p>
</div>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>You can’t use an <abbr title="Interim possession order">IPO</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re also making a claim for damages caused by the squatters - instead make an ordinary claim for possession under <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/courts-and-tribunals/courts/procedure-rules/civil/contents/practice_directions/pd_part55a.htm" title="Part 55(A) of the Civil Procedure Rules">Part 55(A) of the Civil Procedure Rules</a>
</li>
  <li>more than 28 days have passed since you found out about the squatters</li>
  <li>you’re trying to evict former tenants, sub-tenants or licensees - instead see <a href="/private-renting-evictions" title="Private renting: evictions">Private renting: evictions</a> or <a href="/council-housing-association-evictions" title="Council and housing association evictions">Council and housing association evictions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once squatters are served with an <abbr title="Interim possession order">IPO</abbr>, they must leave the property within 24 hours. If they don’t, they’re committing a crime and could serve up to 6 months in prison. </p>

<p>It’s also a crime for them to return to the property within 12 months.</p>


</article><article id="where-to-get-help"><header><h1>Part 4: Where to get help</h1>
  </header><h2>If you’re squatting</h2>
<p>If you’re squatting, you’re legally classed as homeless. Read the <a rel="external" href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/homelessness/squatting" title="Shelter: Squatting">advice from Shelter</a> and <a href="/homelessness-help-from-council" title="Homelessness - get help from your council">contact your local council</a> for help.</p>

<h2>To report squatters</h2>
<p>If you see someone breaking into a property, call the police.</p>

<p>If you suspect someone is squatting in a property, <a href="/report-squatters-property" title="Report squatting to your local council">report them to your local council</a> or the police.</p>

<h2>Displaced residential occupiers</h2>
<p>If you find squatters in your home who won’t leave, you’re a ‘displaced residential occupier’ and the squatters are committing a crime. Call the police.</p>

<h2>Protected intending occupiers</h2>
<p>If there are squatters in a property you’re planning on moving into, you may be a ‘protected intending occupier’. Give the squatters a statement showing you are the rightful occupier. </p>

<p>You can find the legal definition of a protected intending occupier, and full details of the statement you need to write, in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/45/section/12A" title="Section 12A of the Criminal Law Act 1977">section 12A of the Criminal Law Act 1977.</a> <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/cabdir.ihtml#txt_getadvice_header-Anchor-search" title="Find your local Citizens Advice Bureau">Citizens Advice</a> can provide help and advice. </p>

<p>You should then call the police.</p>
