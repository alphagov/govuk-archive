<ul>

</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can only choose one option and you can’t change to the other after you’ve made your decision.</p>
</div>

<p>Talk to your sponsoring approved driving instructor (<abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>) or training organisation about which option is best for you.</p>

<h2>Option 1 - supervision of lessons</h2>

<p>In this option you have to be supervised by your sponsoring <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> for 20% of all the lessons you give.</p>

<p>You must keep a record of the number of hours:</p>

<ul>
<li>you give lessons</li>
  <li>you are supervised</li>
</ul>
<p>The form must be signed by both you and your <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>. You must send it to the Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>) when your trainee licence runs out.</p>

<br><br></p></div></div>

<h2>Option 2 - extra training</h2>

<p>In this option you have to do at least 20 hours of extra training in the topics in the training programme.</p>

<p>You must do the training within 3 months of getting your trainee licence or before you take the <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 3 test - whichever is sooner.</p>

<p>At least 25% of the training must be practical in-car training.</p>

<p>The training must be recorded on the instructor training declaration form.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must take 5 hours of extra training before your next attempt if you fail your first or second attempt at the <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 3 test.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll have to give proof that you’ve done the extra training. If you don’t, your trainee licence can be taken away.</p>


</article><article id="rules-for-using-your-trainee-licence"><header><h1>Part 3: Rules for using your trainee licence</h1>
  </header><p>You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be a ‘fit and proper’ person</li>
  <li>get the required amount of supervision or extra training while your licence is still valid</li>
  <li>make sure your advertising doesn’t make it seem like you’re a fully qualified instructor</li>
</ul>
<h2>Displaying your licence</h2>

<p>You must display your trainee licence on the nearside edge of the front windscreen of your car while you give driving lessons.</p>

<h2>Where you work</h2>

<p>Your trainee licence shows the name and address of your training establishment. You can only give instruction from there, so you can’t work independently, eg by setting up your own school.</p>

<h2>Changing your driving school</h2>

<p>You must apply for a new trainee licence if you leave a driving school and join a new one. There’s no fee for doing this.</p>

<p>The Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>) will send you a new licence showing the details of your new school. You should send your old licence to <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> as soon as you get the new one.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can still give driving lessons while you wait for your new licence.</p>
</div>

<h2>When trainee licences can be taken away</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registrar can take your trainee licence away before it runs out if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you break any of the rules for having a trainee licence</li>
  <li>the licence was issued by mistake or gained by fraud</li>
  <li>you fail 3 attempts at the <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 3 test</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not using your trainee licence</h2>

<p>You should return your trainee licence to <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> if you aren’t using it, eg because of a long period of illness.</p>

<p>You won’t get a refund, but <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> will know that you haven’t had full use of the licence. This will be a factor in deciding whether to give you another licence in future.</p>

<h2>Lost or stolen licence</h2>

<p>You should <a href="/contact-police" title="Tell the police">tell the police</a> straight away if your licence is lost or stolen. They will give you a crime reference number.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You’ll have to pay £3 if you lose your licence or can’t give <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> a crime reference number.</p>
</div>

<p>To get a replacement, you’ll need to send the following to <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>the crime reference number</li>
  <li>a recent passport-style photograph if you don’t give <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> permission to use your photocard driving licence photo or don’t have a photocard licence</li>
  <li>the fee if your licence was lost or you can’t give a crime reference number</li>
</ul>

</article><article id="when-your-trainee-licence-runs-out"><header><h1>Part 4: When your trainee licence runs out</h1>
  </header><p>Your trainee licence lasts for 6 months. When it runs out you must stop being paid for giving driving lessons.</p>

<h2>Getting another licence</h2>

<p>You can <a href="/apply-for-a-trainee-driving-instructor-licence" title="Apply for a trainee licence">apply for another trainee licence</a> if you feel you haven’t had the full benefit out it. You’ll need to pay the fee again.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can’t be paid for giving driving lessons when you don’t have a valid trainee licence.</p>
</div>

<p>You’re more likely to get another licence if you told the Driving Standards Agency you had stopped using the first, eg because of a period of illness.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely that you’ll get another licence just to give you more time to pass the approved driving instructor (<abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>) part 3 test.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> </p>

<p>It’s unlikely you’ll get another trainee licence if you already have a full-time job and you can only practise using your licence in the evenings and at weekends.</p>
