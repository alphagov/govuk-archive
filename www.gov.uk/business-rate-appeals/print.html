  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>The rates you pay on your business property depend on its ‘rateable value’. This is calculated by the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>).  </p>

<p>If you think the current value for your property is wrong you can: </p>

<ul>
<li>ask the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> to correct the details you think are wrong</li>
  <li>appeal your rates if you and the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> can’t agree (appeals are made to the Valuation Tribunal)</li>
</ul>
<p>You must continue to pay your rates during the appeal.</p>


</article><article id="before-you-appeal"><header><h1>Part 2: Before you appeal</h1>
  </header><p>The first step in appealing your business rates is to ask the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) to check details about your property.  This can change how much you pay for your business rates.  </p>

<p>If you think your rateable value is wrong:  </p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.2010.voa.gov.uk/rli/en/basic/find" title="Check the details of your property">check the details</a> used to value your property</li>
  <li>make a <a rel="external" href="http://www.2010.voa.gov.uk" title="VOA website">valuation enquiry</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> will change your rateable value if it was wrong.  They may need to visit your property.</p>

<p>You can start an appeal at any time with the Valuation Tribunal.</p>

<h2>Material changes</h2>

<p>A material change is a physical change to the part or all of your property. This can change the rateable value of your property.</p>

<p>Material changes can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>changes to how the property is used</li>
  <li>new developments in the area</li>
  <li>changes to access routes or footpaths to the area</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extreme flooding</h2>

<p>You should notify the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> immediately if extreme flooding is affecting the use of your property. There might be a reduction of your business rates.</p>

</article><article id="types-of-appeals"><header><h1>Part 3: Types of appeals</h1>
  </header><h2>Valuation appeals</h2>

<p>You must still pay your bill during the appeal.  </p>

<p>You can appeal once against the rateable value set at revaluation. You can also appeal against any one of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.2010.voa.gov.uk/rli/static/HelpPages/English/faqs/faq100-grounds_of_appeal.html" title="Valuation Office Agency - on what grounds can I appeal">12 stated grounds.</a></p>

<p>Reasons to appeal include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the valuation was wrong  </li>
  <li>there has been a change to the property or area that should be shown in the rateable value  </li>
  <li>a change made to the valuation by the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) is wrong  </li>
</ul>
<p>The rateable value is set every 5 years. The last time was 1 April 2010.</p>

<h2>Penalty notice appeals</h2>

<p>A penalty notice can be issued to you if don’t give the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> information they’ve asked you for to set their rateable value.</p>

<p>You don’t have to pay the penalty until after the tribunal has made a decision. However, you may get more penalties during the appeals process.</p>

<h2>Completion notice appeals</h2>

<p>Your local authority will give you a completion notice when it thinks that:</p>

<ul>
<li>a new property is finished</li>
  <li>a new property can be finished by a certain date</li>
</ul>
<p>This means you must start paying business rates on the property once the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> has added your property to the rating list.  </p>

<h2>Transitional certificate appeals</h2>

<p>A transitional certificate is given when a valuation officer knows there is something wrong with the ratings list  but can’t fix it. The certificate is given to show the correct amount in your business rates bill. You can appeal against the value transitional certificate but not against being given a transitional certificate.</p>
