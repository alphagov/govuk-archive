<p>Families’ Activity Breaks (<abbr title="Families' Activity Breaks">FAB</abbr>) is a non-public funded, tri-service initiative in partnership with the Youth Hostel Association of England and Wales, providing fun and challenging activity holidays around the UK for bereaved military families.</p>

<p>If your child is aged up to 19 years old and has suffered the loss of a loved one who was serving in the Armed Forces, then you may be eligible for a <abbr title="Families' Activity Breaks">FAB</abbr> holiday. The holidays offer an adventure for all the family and a welcome break to meet and socialising with others who have experienced a similar loss. A loved one can mean a parent, a step parent, or a child’s legal guardian, carer or sibling.</p>

<p><abbr title="Families' Activity Breaks">FAB</abbr> was originally conceived in early 2008, and run as a highly successful pilot in 2009. For the first year, 24 families took part at 2 locations, Coverack in Cornwall and Whitby in North Yorkshire. In 2010 we were able to provide 50 families with the opportunity to attend these exciting camps which were a great success. Looking forward to the summer of 2011, there will be spaces for 60 families to attend a <abbr title="Families' Activity Breaks">FAB</abbr> camp in either Coverack or Whitby.</p>

<p><abbr title="Families' Activity Breaks">FAB</abbr> is staffed by volunteers from the Armed Forces and defence civilians who mentor, lend a helping hand or simply listen. They are all trained by the Candle Project, a bereavement counselling service run by St Christopher’s Hospice, London, who specialise in supporting children and young adults facing bereavement.</p>

<h2 id="information-for-families-and-how-to-apply">Information for families and how to apply</h2>

<p>Family applications for <abbr title="Families' Activity Breaks">FAB</abbr> holidays will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. When arranging the holidays, we will also aim to provide each family with their first choice of location. On completion of the application form you will receive an acknowledgment letter and booking details from the Youth Hostel Association.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-eligible-for-a-fab-holiday">Who is eligible for a <abbr title="Families' Activity Breaks">FAB</abbr> holiday?</h3>

<p>If your child is aged up to 19 years old and has suffered the loss of a loved one who was serving in the Armed Forces, then you may be eligible for a <abbr title="Families' Activity Breaks">FAB</abbr> holiday. By loved one, we mean a parent, a step-parent, a legal guardian, a carer or a sibling. We aim to be as flexible and inclusive as possible, providing activity breaks to families based on the need of children. If you are unsure if you are eligible for a holiday please contact the Project Director (details below).</p>

<h3 id="support-during-your-break">Support during your break</h3>

<p>All families will be supported by our <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>-staffed volunteer scheme, and you will also have access to a bereavement counsellor throughout your stay. The <abbr title="Families' Activity Breaks">FAB</abbr> breaks are not intended as bereavement holidays, but we recognise that families may need some support during the week even if it is just someone friendly to talk to.</p>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

<p><abbr title="Families' Activity Breaks">FAB</abbr> holidays provide a full programme of popular events for families, including a variety of day trips and younger children’s activities.</p>

<p>Families are free to pick and choose which activities they want to take part in. Ultimately this is your families’ holiday and you are under no obligation to take part in anything, so please join in as and when you want to. If you would like to organise your own activities or day trips, we will be happy to provide local information and help.</p>

<p>All activities are conducted by fully insured, qualified and professional instructors using national standards of protection and safety equipment. </p>
