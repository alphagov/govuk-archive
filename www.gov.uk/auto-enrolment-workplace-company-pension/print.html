</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: How auto-enrolment works</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll be automatically enrolled into a workplace pension between 2012 and 2018 if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>don’t already have a workplace pension </li>
  <li>earn more than £8,105 a year</li>
  <li>are 22 or over</li>
  <li>are under State Pension age</li>
  <li>work (or usually work) in the UK</li>
  <li>don’t <a href="/auto-enrolment-workplace-company-pension/opting-out-auto-enrolment" title="Opting out of auto-enrolment">opt out</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>When auto-enrolment starts</h2>
<p>Your employer will tell you when auto-enrolment begins for your organisation.</p>

<p>Large employers start auto-enrolment in late 2012 and smaller organisations will follow between 2013 and 2018. </p>

<div class="advisory">
<p><strong>Your pension is protected by the government if your employer goes out of business - you should get any money you’re owed.</strong></p>
</div>

</article><article id="who-contributes-to-this-pension"><header><h1>Part 2: How much auto-enrolment costs</h1>
  </header><p>You and your employer pay money each month into your pension. Most people will also get tax relief (money you would have paid as tax) from the government.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/yourmoney/interactive/workplace_pension_contribution_calculator.aspx" title="Auto-enrolment calculator" rel="external">Money Advice Service’s auto-enrolment calculator</a> to work out how much you and your employer contribute to your pension.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

<p>John earns £12,000 a year (£1,000 a month) so he’ll get the following towards his pension: </p>

<ul>
<li>£30 a month from his employer (3% of John’s income)</li>
  <li>£40 a month from his monthly pay (4% of John’s income)</li>
  <li>£10 a month from the government in tax relief (1% of John’s income)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although John puts in £40, the total contribution to his pension is £80 a month.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="opting-out-auto-enrolment"><header><h1>Part 3: Opting out of auto-enrolment</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to join your employer’s workplace pension scheme, and you can leave (‘opt out’) at any time. This won’t change under auto-enrolment, but if you do leave you won’t get the employer contribution or tax relief from the government.</p>

<p><a href="/workplace-pensions/opting-out" title="Opting out">To opt out</a>, contact the people who run your employer’s pension scheme and tell them you want to leave. Your employer will provide you with their contact details.</p>

<p>If you do this within a month of joining the scheme, you’ll be treated as if you never joined in the first place and you’ll get any payments you’ve made back.</p>

<h2>Opting back in</h2>

<p>Contact your employer if you’ve left their pension scheme and want to rejoin.</p>
