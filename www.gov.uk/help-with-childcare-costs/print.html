  </header><p>There are different kinds of help you can get with the cost of childcare.</p>

<h2>Free education for 3 and 4 year olds</h2>

<p>All 3 and 4 year olds are entitled to 15 hours of free education for 38 weeks of the year. This can be at:</p>

<ul>
<li>nursery schools</li>
  <li>children’s centres</li>
  <li>day nurseries</li>
  <li>playgroups and pre-school</li>
  <li>childminders</li>
</ul>
<p>For help and advice, contact your local <a href="/find-family-information-service" title="Family Information Service">Family Information Service.</a></p>

<h2>Sure Start Children’s Centres</h2>

<p>Sure Start Children’s Centres offer a lot of help to families including:</p>

<ul>
<li>early years education for children</li>
  <li>parenting advice</li>
  <li>training and employment advice for parents</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/sure-start-childrens-centres" title="Find your local Sure Start centre">Find your local Sure Start centre.</a></p>

<h3>What it costs</h3>

<p>If you want more childcare than you’re entitled to for free (for 3 or 4 year olds), there will be a charge.</p>

<h2>After school clubs</h2>

<p>Some schools offer activities outside normal school hours. Schools can charge for this (as much as the activity costs to organise) but you might be able to get <a href="/qualify-tax-credits-quick-questionnaire" title="Tax Credits">Tax Credits.</a></p>

<h2>Childcare tax credits</h2>

<p>If you work and pay for childcare you may be able to get extra <a href="/childcare-tax-credits" title="Childcare and tax credits">Tax Credits</a> to help with the costs.</p>

</article><article id="childcare-from-your-employer"><header><h1>Part 2: Childcare from your employer</h1>
  </header><h2>Exempt from tax and national insurance</h2>

<p>There are types of childcare support your employer might provide that you don’t have to pay tax or national insurance contributions on:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/childcare-tax-credits/childcare-vouchers" title="Childcare vouchers">childcare vouchers</a></li>
  <li>directly contracted childcare (childcare arranged by your employer with a specific provider)</li>
  <li>workplace nurseries</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not exempt from tax and national insurance</h2>

<p>You have to pay tax and national insurance on what you get if your employer offers:</p>

<ul>
<li>cash to pay for childcare</li>
  <li>childcare fees paid direct to the childcare provider</li>
  <li>school fees paid direct</li>
</ul></article><article id="support-while-you-study"><header><h1>Part 3: Support while you study</h1>
  </header><h2>Discretionary Learner Support</h2>

<p>If you’re 19 or over and on a further education course you may be able to get <a href="/discretionary-learner-support" title="Discretionary learner support">Discretionary Learner Support</a> to pay for childcare. Each college has its own scheme so contact the college direct to find out more.</p>

<h2>Childcare Grant</h2>

<p>If you’re in full-time higher education you can apply for a <a href="/childcare-grant" title="Childcare Grant">Childcare Grant</a> to pay for childcare costs for children under 15, or under 17 if they have special needs.</p>

<h2>Care to Learn</h2>

<p><a href="/care-to-learn" title="Care to Learn">Care to Learn</a> payments go direct to your childcare provider to pay for childcare costs. You may be able to get Care to Learn if you’re under 20 and caring for your own child.</p>
