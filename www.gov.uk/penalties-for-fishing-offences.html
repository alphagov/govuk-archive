<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The financial administrative penalties (FAP) system for fisheries offences complements the existing fisheries enforcement system. You may be offered a penalty as an alternative to criminal prosecution in certain circumstances. A penalty will only be offered where there is reason to believe that an offence has been committed for which a FAP may be issued – these are known as penalty offences.</p>

<h2 id="offences-that-may-lead-to-a-fap">Offences that may lead to a FAP</h2>

<p>Penalty offences are categorised as:</p>

<ul>
<li>marketing offences</li>
  <li>miscellaneous offences</li>
  <li>technical conservation measures (gear) offences</li>
  <li>technical conservation measures (catch) offences</li>
  <li>recovery stock offences</li>
  <li>control offences (including Registered Buyers and Sellers and UK licence offences)</li>
  <li>access offences</li>
  <li>illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing offences</li>
  <li>undersized fiish offences</li>
  <li>inshore fisheries and conservation authorities (IFCA) access offences</li>
  <li>IFCA technical conservation (catch) offences</li>
  <li>IFCA technical conservation (gear) offences</li>
  <li>IFCA permit offences</li>
</ul>
<p>A full list of penalty offences is available in Appendix 2 of the full <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/documents/fap_guidance.pdf">Financial administrative penalties for fisheries offences guidance on the MMO website (PDF 256KB</a>.</p>

<p>The scheme applies to penalty offences committed in relation to sea fishing as listed in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/758/made">Sea Fishing (Penalty Notices) (England) Order 2011</a> in England and by English and Welsh vessels wherever they operate (except Wales and the Welsh Zone) or by other vessels within English waters of British fishery limits. The owner, master, charterer, representative, operator and/or legally liable person may be issued with a penalty notice.</p>

<p>If you commit a penalty offence and accept the offered FAP you will not be convicted if you pay the FAP within 28 days. You do not have to pay the FAP and can choose to have the matter dealt with in court instead. Not paying the FAP is not an offence.
FAPs will not be offered for:</p>

<ul>
<li>obstruction, failure to comply with requirements made by marine enforcement officers (MEOs) or preventing another person from complying, and assaults/threats to MEOs or those assisting them – these will be referred for prosecution</li>
  <li>offences under an EU recovery plan which attract automatic licence suspension when no further penalty will apply</li>
  <li>certain IUU offences pertaining to the operation and engagement of IUU-listed vessels</li>
</ul>
<p>Written warnings may still be issued, however please note that a written warning or a financial administrative penalty may not always be issued for a first or subsequent offence where the authorities believe that the offending is of such a nature that court proceedings are more appropriate.</p>

<p>Repeat offending may result in increased penalties or automatic referral for prosecution.</p>

<p>This guide explains the circumstances in which FAPs apply, the investigation process and how the level of the offence is assessed. It outlines the four levels of penalty payable, and explains how they can be paid.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-and-investigating-fisheries-offences">Detecting and investigating fisheries offences</h2>

<p>MEOs will carry out investigations into suspected fisheries offences according to MMO’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/about/documents/compliance_enforcement.pdf">Compliance and Enforcement Strategy (PDF 88KB)</a>.</p>

<p>A decision will be made regarding action to be taken for any offences detected within 6 weeks of finalising the investigation. You will be notified of the decision in writing.</p>

<p>Your fishing licence will be frozen for UK vessels during the investigation process. If you are offered a FAP the licence freeze will remain in place until the penalty is paid or, if you choose not to pay the penalty, until subsequent court proceedings are concluded.
If a decision is made not to take further action then the licence freeze will be lifted.</p>

<p>A FAP may be issued by the MMO for any of the penalty offences listed in Appendix 2 of the full <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/documents/fap_guidance.pdf">Financial administrative penalties for fisheries offences guidance on the MMO website (PDF 256KB</a>.</p>

<h2 id="considering-a-financial-administrative-penalty">Considering a financial administrative penalty</h2>

<p>Where there is evidence which gives an authorised officer reason to believe that a penalty offence has been committed, the facts of the case will be assessed against the following criteria for the purpose of deciding whether a FAP is appropriate:</p>

<ul>
<li>severity of the infringement – how serious the offence is including, where appropriate, environmental impact</li>
  <li>previous infringement history – including what action was taken as a result of any previous infringements</li>
  <li>other offences detected at the same time as the offence in question and the nature of these offences – these may add to the seriousness of the overall infringement</li>
  <li>value of catch – this may affect the decision if the potential financial gain of the offence exceeds the proposed penalty (the value of the illegal catch will be determined wherever possible by the previous week’s average prices at the most appropriate market, which may include markets outside the UK if, for example, the vessel concerned routinely lands abroad)</li>
  <li>volume of catch – this is particularly relevant to by-catch offences but may also factor in other offences where the volume of illegal catch is significant</li>
  <li>whether the species involved is subject to stock recovery measures</li>
</ul>
<p>Where a single investigation results in the discovery of more than one offence then the offences will be broken down, categorised and given individual penalties to a maximum combined value of £10,000. The MMO may at its discretion decide not to offer a penalty notice but refer the matter for prosecution.</p>

<h2 id="determining-penalty-level">Determining penalty level</h2>

<p>There are 4 basic levels of FAP depending on the nature of the offence committed. These range from £250 to £2,000 as set out in the first column of the table below.</p>

<p>Where the identified financial gain (connected to or resulting from the offence) is greater than the proposed level of penalty, the penalty offered will be increased by multiples of the relevant basic penalty level (£250, £500, £1,000 or £2,000) until the value of the penalty is greater than that of the identified financial gain.</p>

<p>This could include where appropriate, offering a penalty of up to £10,000. If the financial gain is greater than £10,000, or the financial gain in relation to the offence is deemed to be of a serious nature, a FAP will not be offered and the offence will be referred to court.</p>

<p>Where multiple offences are detected, the identified financial gain will only be considered once in relation to the penalty offences. Where the financial gain has already been considered in the calculation of a penalty, the remaining penalty offences will be offered at the relevant basic penalty level. Multiple penalty notices may be issued to a total combined value of £10,000.</p>

<p>The FAP will be increased to the next level available if any of the legally liable persons offered the penalty have received a penalty for the same category of offence in the previous two years. This could include, in the case of a second offence attracting a level 4 penalty, offering a basic penalty of £4,000 which may be increased to a maximum of £10,000 to cover the identified financial gain.</p>

<h2 id="penalty-notices">Penalty notices</h2>

<p>Once a decision has been made to offer a FAP  a notice containing details of the offence and the level of the penalty being offered will be issued to those deemed liable for the penalty offence. Notices will be hand-delivered or sent by post and will state how payments should be made if the offer is accepted.</p>

<p>A penalty notice can be withdrawn before or after the payment of the penalty, if it:</p>

<ul>
<li>is issued by mistake </li>
  <li>contains technical errors </li>
  <li>is issued to the wrong person </li>
</ul>
<p>Where a penalty notice is withdrawn, any monies paid will be repaid in full, but a new notice may be issued if appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="payment">Payment</h3>

<p>FAPs must be paid by owner, master, charterer, operator, representative and/or legally liable person within 28 days of the issue of the notice. The MMO will accept one person paying on behalf of others who are liable.</p>

<p>For example, if the master and the owner have both been issued with a £1,000 penalty notice for an offence for which they are jointly and severally liable, they do not have to pay £1,000 each. Instead, if the owner pays £1,000 the notice issued to the master is considered to have been paid </p>

<p>Once a payment has been received in respect of a joint offence a written notice (a notice of deemed payment) will be sent to any other legally liable person or people stating that payment has been received and their penalty is seen as being paid.</p>

<h3 id="objecting-to-the-penalty">Objecting to the penalty</h3>

<p>A written notice of objection must be sent by post or delivered by hand within 28 days of the penalty notice being issued, or within 5 days of the notice of deemed payment being given if the person(s) are opposed to their penalty being treated as having been paid.</p>

<p>Where this happens, your penalty will not be treated as having been paid, so if the penalty remains unpaid at the end of the 28 day period the case will be referred for prosecution in the usual way. This will not affect those who have actually paid, or who do not object to having their penalty notice treated as having been paid.</p>

<p>Should a prosecution result in conviction, the penalty you have paid will be applied towards any fine imposed by the court and any excess will be repaid to you. Should the court case result in acquittal, the penalty will be repaid to you in full.</p>

<h3 id="paying-the-penalty-if-you-are-a-non-british-registered-vessel">Paying the penalty if you are a non-British registered vessel</h3>

<p>The scheme applies to all relevant legally liable persons however a penalty will only be offered to a non-British registered vessel if the penalty is accepted at the time it is offered, or the vessel may be detained to port for prosecution. 28 days will still be permitted for payment of the penalty, however should no payment be made by the end of the 28 day period court proceedings will be issued and, if applicable, the vessel detained to port.</p>

<p>If, following payment of the penalty, you wish the matter to be referred for prosecution you must give written notice requesting that proceedings be brought. The notice must:</p>

<ul>
<li>indicate that the person giving the notice wishes proceedings to be brought in relation to the offence(s) to which the penalty notice relates</li>
  <li>be given within 28 days, beginning with the date the penalty notice was issued</li>
</ul>
<p>Should a prosecution result in conviction, the penalty you have paid will be applied towards any fine imposed by the court and any excess will be repaid to you. Should the court case result in acquittal, the penalty will be repaid to you in full.</p>

<h3 id="central-register-of-penalties">Central register of penalties</h3>

<p>Details of all penalties will be held in a central register. If you choose not to pay a penalty and are found not guilty in court, no infringement will be recorded on the database and will not count as a previous offence in any future decisions.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-pay-your-penalty">How to pay your penalty</h3>

<p>Payments must be made either by cheque or by electronic transfer. Please use  one of the payment methods listed in Appendix 3 of the full <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/documents/fap_guidance.pdf">Financial administrative penalties for fisheries offences guidance on the MMO website (PDF 256KB</a>.</p>

<p>You must make your payment in time to allow it to be cleared before the end of the 28 day payment period. If paying by cheque you should allow 5 working days for cheques paid to be cleared.</p>

<p>Payments in euros must be sufficient to cover the total penalty value after conversion into sterling and relevant bank charges.</p>
