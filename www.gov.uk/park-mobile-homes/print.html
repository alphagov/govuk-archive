  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="your-rights-and-obligations"><header><h1>Part 1: Your rights and obligations</h1>
  </header><p>Your rights and obligations are listed in a written agreement with the park (or site) owner. This sets out:</p>

<ul>
<li>your minimum legal rights and obligations, like your right to keep your park home on its pitch</li>
  <li>the rules, charges and services</li>
</ul>
<p>You have 28 days to review it before signing.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t have a written agreement, you still have all the rights set out in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/34/contents" title="Mobile Homes Act 1983">Mobile Homes Act of 1983.</a></p>

<h2>Keeping your home in good condition</h2>
<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>repair your home when necessary </li>
  <li>keep the outside of your home and pitch clean and tidy, including any fences or outbuildings that you own or use on your pitch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Site licence</h2>
<p>Privately owned sites must have a licence from the local council. The park owner must clearly display the licence. It will usually have conditions for:</p>

<ul>
<li>how many homes can be in the park </li>
  <li>services and amenities </li>
  <li>health and safety </li>
</ul>
<p>To complain about conditions in your park, talk to the park owner first. If the issue isn’t sorted out, contact your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Contact your local council">local council</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You could be forced to leave if you live on a site without planning permission for residential use.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="renting-a-park-home"><header><h1>Part 2: Renting a park home</h1>
  </header><p>Rented homes, including park homes, come under the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/26/contents" title="Landlord and Tenant Act 1988">Landlord and Tenant Act 1988</a></p>

<p>If your landlord collects rent from you, this means you have a rental contract even if it isn’t in writing.</p>

<h2>You don’t have a written contract</h2>
<p>If you don’t have anything in writing you should be able to stay for a year from the date you moved in. </p>

<h2>You have a written contract</h2>
<p>If you have a written contract it should say how long you can live in your home. </p>

<p>During this time your landlord can still ask you to leave if: </p>

<ul>
<li>your contract says they can ask you to leave with 4 weeks’ notice</li>
  <li>you break the rules (‘terms’) of your contract and it says the owner can ask you to leave as a result</li>
</ul>
<h2>When your contract ends</h2>
<p>Your landlord can ask you to leave as long as they give you 4 weeks’ notice. If you don’t leave the owner can ask the court for an ‘eviction order’ which forces you to leave.</p>

<h2>Your landlord asks you to leave</h2>
<p>If your landlord tries to <a href="/private-renting-evictions/rules-your-landlord-must-follow" title="Private renting: evictions">evict you</a> (force you to leave), you will have more rights to stay if you live on a ‘protected site’. A protected site is a mobile home park which has planning permission to have residents living there throughout the year. A holiday park isn’t a protected site. </p>

<p>Your right to stay also depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>what your rental contract says</li>
  <li>if your home is counted as a ‘dwelling house’ and therefore covered by certain tenancy laws</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your home is counted as a ‘dwelling house’</h3>
<p>You may have rights from tenancy laws if your home is counted as a ‘dwelling house’. </p>

<p>To be a dwelling house your park home must be:</p>

<ul>
<li>your permanent residence – where you live most or all of the time</li>
  <li>connected to mains supplies of electricity or water</li>
  <li>unmovable or so large that it can’t be moved in one piece – eg you can’t drive it or tow it away yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of tenancy you have depends on the date you moved in and started paying rent. You will have either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a href="/private-renting-tenancy-agreements/tenancy-types" title="Regulated tenancies">regulated tenancy</a> – this is if you moved in and started paying rent before 15 January 1989</li>
  <li>an <a href="/private-renting-tenancy-agreements/tenancy-types" title="Assured or assured short hold tenancies">assured or assured shorthold tenancy</a> – this is if you moved in and started paying rent after 15 January 1989</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting advice</h2>
<p>Tenancy rights can be complicated and depend on your situation. You should get <a href="/legal-aid" title="Get legal advice">legal advice</a> if you think your landlord is treating you unfairly.</p>

<p>You can also contact a Citizens Advice Bureau or charities such as Shelter or Age UK if you have questions.</p>

</article><article id="charges"><header><h1>Part 3: Charges</h1>
  </header><h2>Pitch fee</h2>
<p>You have to pay a ‘pitch fee’ to the park owner to rent the land your park home sits on.</p>

<p>The park owner can propose changing it once a year. They must give you 28 days’ notice in writing. </p>

<p>If you and the park owner can’t agree on a new fee, the park owner can apply to a <a href="/housing-tribunals/residential-property-tribunal-council-homes-and-park-homes" title="Housing tribunals: Residential property tribunal: council homes and park homes">residential property tribunal</a>. </p>

<p>Until the tribunal reaches a decision, you should continue to pay your current fee. </p>

<h2>Gas, water, electricity and liquefied petroleum gas (<abbr title="liquefied petroleum gas">LPG</abbr>)</h2>
<p>The Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets (<abbr title="Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets">Ofgem</abbr>) sets the amount you can be charged for gas and electricity.</p>

<p>The park owner can’t charge you more than the price <abbr title="Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets">Ofgem</abbr> sets, plus any connection charges set by the utility company.</p>

<p>For water, the park owner can only charge what the water company charges plus a reasonable administration fee. </p>

<p>Charges for <abbr title="liquefied petroleum gas">LPG</abbr> aren’t regulated.</p>


</article><article id="selling-or-giving-away-a-park-home"><header><h1>Part 4: Selling or giving away a park home</h1>
  </header><p>When you sell your home the site owner gets up to 10% of the selling price. </p>

<p>You need to get the site owner to approve your buyer. They must send you an answer in writing within 28 days.</p>

<p>If you think the site owner has been unfair or has not sent an answer within 28 days, you can apply to a <a href="/housing-tribunals/residential-property-tribunal-council-homes-and-park-homes" title="Housing tribunals: Residential property tribunal: council homes and park homes">residential property tribunal</a>. The tribunal will decide whether to order the site owner to approve your buyer.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Park homes <strong>don’t</strong> need an Energy Performance Certificate (<abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr>).</p>
</div>

<h2>Giving away a park home</h2>
<p>You have the right to give your park home away and pass on your agreement to a family member who’s been approved by the site owner.</p>

<h2>Inheritance rules</h2>
<p>If you die and people living with you are also covered under the agreement, they’ll continue with the same agreement. </p>

<p>If you’re the only person with an agreement, then your husband, wife or civil partner will automatically take it over and can continue living in the park home. </p>

<p>If there’s no such person but another member of your family was living in the home at the time, they can take over the agreement and continue to live there.</p>

<h3>If no family member lives with you</h3>
<p>Whoever inherits your home will also inherit your agreement. But, to live there, they must get approval from the site owner.</p>


</article><article id="park-repairs-and-improvements-"><header><h1>Part 5: Park repairs and improvements </h1>
  </header><p>Site owners are responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping common areas (like shared paths) in good condition</li>
  <li>repairing the area where your home sits (the ‘base’)</li>
  <li>maintaining any services they supply to your home or pitch (like sewerage)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Park improvements</h2>
<p>If the park owner plans to make improvements, they must:</p>

<ul>
<li>give you at least 28 days’ notice in writing and let you know how you can comment on the plans</li>
  <li>tell you if it will affect your pitch fee</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if most residents disagree with the proposed improvements in writing, the park owner can still go ahead. But the site owner can’t recover the costs of the improvements through a pitch fee review - unless a <a href="/housing-tribunals/residential-property-tribunal-council-homes-and-park-homes" title="Housing tribunals: Residential property tribunal: council homes and park homes">residential property tribunal</a> agrees to this. </p>

</article><article id="residents-associations"><header><h1>Part 6: Residents’ associations</h1>
  </header><p>You can set up a ‘qualifying’ residents’ association to represent home owners in the mobile home park where you live. </p>

<p>Qualifying residents’ associations have certain rights and should be consulted when park owners want to spend money on improvements or change how they run the park. </p>

<p>Park owners must give at least 28 days’ notice of any changes and take the association’s concerns into account before they make changes.</p>

<h2>Setting up a qualifying residents’ association</h2>
<p>Your association must include at least half of the home owners in your park. Residents who rent their homes can’t join.</p>

<p>It will have to keep certain records and documents, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>an up-to-date list of members </li>
  <li>a constitution </li>
  <li>any other rules of the association </li>
</ul>
<p>It will have to elect a:</p>

<ul>
<li>chairman</li>
  <li>secretary</li>
  <li>treasurer</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from administrative decisions taken by the chair, secretary and treasurer, decisions are taken by voting.</p>

<p>You need to ask the park owner to ‘acknowledge’ your association. If they don’t, you can apply to a <a href="/housing-tribunals/residential-property-tribunal-council-homes-and-park-homes" title="Housing tribunals: Residential property tribunal: council homes and park homes">residential property tribunal</a>. If the tribunal agrees with you, it will order the park owner to acknowledge your association. </p>

<p>If your association doesn’t meet the qualifying conditions, it won’t have the same rights. It can continue to meet, but the park owner won’t have to talk to the association about park operations and management.</p>

</article><article id="settling-disputes"><header><h1>Part 7: Settling disputes</h1>
  </header><p>If you have a dispute with the park owner that you can’t work out, you can go to a <a href="/housing-tribunals/residential-property-tribunal-council-homes-and-park-homes" title="Housing tribunals: Residential property tribunal: council homes and park homes">residential property tribunal</a>. Decisions made by the tribunal are legally binding.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If your agreement says you must use an arbitrator, ignore it. You must use a residential property tribunal instead.</p>
</div>

<p>The tribunal can settle disputes over:</p>

<ul>
<li>changing a resident’s agreement </li>
  <li>changing the pitch fee </li>
  <li>moving a park home </li>
  <li>damage and repairs to the site </li>
  <li>transferring ownership of a park home to someone else </li>
