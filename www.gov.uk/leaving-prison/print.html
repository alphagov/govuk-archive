  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="when-someone-can-leave-prison"><header><h1>Part 1: When someone can leave prison</h1>
  </header><p>When a prisoner is released depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the length of their sentence</li>
  <li>their behaviour in prison </li>
  <li>any time spent on remand (waiting for their trial)</li>
</ul>
<h3>If the prisoner has a fixed term (determinate) sentence</h3>

<p>A prisoner serving a determinate sentence is normally released automatically halfway through their sentence.</p>

<p>If their sentence is 12 months or more, they will be released on <a href="/guide-to-probation" title="Probation">probation</a>. </p>

<p>A Parole Board is not involved.</p>

<h4>When a Parole Board reviews a case</h4>
<p>A Parole Board only reviews a case if the prisoner’s sentence was more than 4 years and given for a serious violent or sexual crime committed before 4 April 2005.  </p>

<p>The prisoner must apply for parole.</p>

<p>A prisoner can ask their prison offender supervisor or their solicitor if they’re unsure when they can apply for parole.</p>

<p>A Parole Board will then discuss the case and decide if the person can be released.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The Parole Board is independent and not part of the Prison Service.</p>
</div>

<h3>If the prisoner has a non fixed term (indeterminate) or life sentence</h3>

<p>Prisoners serving an indeterminate sentence will have their case automatically reviewed by the Parole Board. This happens around 6 months before the end of their tariff (the minimum length of time the person was ordered to stay in prison).</p>

<p>The decision whether to release a prisoner is made at a Parole Board hearing.</p>


</article><article id="parole-board-hearings-what-happens"><header><h1>Part 2: Parole Board hearings: what happens</h1>
  </header><p>The Parole Board is made up of 3 people. They will review a report about the prisoner which includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>their behaviour in prison</li>
  <li>what they plan to do once released</li>
  <li>whether they’re likely to commit more crime or are a danger to the public</li>
</ul>
<p>There might be other people at the hearing - for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>the prisoner’s solicitor </li>
  <li>a prison psychologist</li>
  <li>the victim</li>
</ul>
<p>The prisoner normally attends a Parole Board hearing to say why they think they should be released.</p>

<h2>The Parole Board’s decision</h2>
<p>The Parole Board will write to the prisoner with their decision.</p>

<p>If the prisoner is released, they go on <a href="/guide-to-probation" title="Probation">probation</a> and are supervised by an offender manager. </p>

<p>If the prisoner isn’t released, their case is automatically reviewed by a Parole Board after a year.</p>

</article><article id="temporary-release-from-prison-"><header><h1>Part 3: Temporary release from prison </h1>
  </header><p>A prisoner may be allowed to leave prison for short periods towards the end of their sentence - whatever its type or length.</p>

<p>However, the prison won’t release someone if it thinks they’re a risk to the public or may commit more crime.</p>

<h2>Resettlement day release</h2>

<p>A resettlement day release lets a prisoner out during the day - eg to go on a training course to help them find work once they are released.</p>

<h2>Resettlement overnight release</h2>

<p>A resettlement overnight release lets a prisoner spend the night at the place they will live at after they’re released.</p>

<h2>Childcare resettlement licence</h2>

<p>A childcare resettlement licence lets a prisoner spend time with their child. They can only apply for this if they’ll be the sole carer of a child when they finish their prison sentence.</p>


</article><article id="support-when-someone-leaves-prison"><header><h1>Part 4: Support when someone leaves prison</h1>
  </header><p>A person leaving prison may get the following financial support:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/jobseekers-allowance" title="Jobseeker's Allowance">Jobseeker’s Allowance</a></li>
  <li><a href="/community-care-grant" title="Community Care Grants">Community Care Grants</a></li>
  <li><a href="/crisis-loans" title="Crisis Loans">Crisis Loans</a></li>
