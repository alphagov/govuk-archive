  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="what-is-contaminated-land"><header><h1>Part 1: What is contaminated land?</h1>
  </header><p>‘Contaminated land’ is used in general terms to describe land polluted by:</p>

<ul>
<li>heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium and lead</li>
  <li>oils and tars</li>
  <li>chemical substances and preparations, eg solvents</li>
  <li>gases</li>
  <li>asbestos</li>
  <li>radioactive substances</li>
</ul>
<h2>Legal definition</h2>
<p>Contaminated land also has a legal definition as land where substances could cause:</p>

<ul>
<li>significant harm to people or protected species</li>
  <li>pollution of surface waters or groundwater</li>
</ul>
<p>This definition refers to contamination caused by past uses of a site, such as former factories, mines, steelworks, refineries and landfills. </p>

</div>

<h2>Radioactive land</h2>
<p>Land is defined as radioactive when a person could be harmed by spending time on land where radioactivity is present.  </p>

<h2>Special sites</h2>
<p>Some types of contaminated land are classed as special sites. This includes land that:</p>

<ul>
<li>seriously affects drinking waters, surface waters (for example lakes and rivers) and important groundwater sources</li>
  <li>has been, or is being, used for certain industrial activities, such as oil refining or making explosives</li>
  <li>is being or has been regulated using a permit issued under the integrated pollution control or pollution prevention and control regimes</li>
  <li>has been used to get rid of waste acid tars</li>
  <li>is owned or occupied by the Ministry of Defence</li>
  <li>is contaminated by radioactivity</li>
  <li>is a nuclear site</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a local council has decided that an area is a special site, it is regulated by:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/planning/33706.aspx" title="Environment Agency - Land contamination">Environment Agency</a> in England and Wales</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/land/contaminated_land.aspx" title="SEPA - Contaminated land">Scottish Environment Protection Agency</a> (<abbr title="Scottish Environment Protection Agency">SEPA</abbr>) in Scotland</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/land-home/land-quality/contaminated_land-2.htm" title="NIEA - Contaminated land">Northern Ireland Environment Agency</a> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland Environment Agency">NIEA</abbr>) in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul></article><article id="who-decides-if-land-is-contaminated"><header><h1>Part 2: Who decides if land is contaminated</h1>
  </header><p>Your land could be investigated for a number of reasons, including when:</p>

<ul>
<li>land is sold, let, used or otherwise transferred</li>
  <li>land is proposed for development</li>
  <li>local councils inspect land in their area</li>
  <li>an application is made for an environmental permit or other licence</li>
  <li>land is polluted</li>
</ul>
<p>If the land is contaminated the local council will decide who is responsible. </p>

<p>If your local council finds contaminated land it will tell:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/planning/33706.aspx" title="Environment Agency - Land contamination">Environment Agency,</a> the <a rel="external" href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/land/contaminated_land.aspx" title="SEPA - Contaminated land">Scottish Environment Protection Agency</a> (<abbr title="Scottish Environment Protection Agency">SEPA</abbr>), or the <a rel="external" href="http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/land-home/land-quality/contaminated_land-2.htm" title="NIEA - Contaminated land">Northern Ireland Environment Agency</a> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland Environment Agency">NIEA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the owner of the land</li>
  <li>any occupiers of the land</li>
  <li>any person who appears to be responsible for the clean-up (known as an appropriate person)</li>
</ul></article><article id="who-has-to-clean-up-the-land"><header><h1>Part 3: Who has to clean up the land?</h1>
  </header><p>Local councils or the relevant agency will decide who is responsible for cleaning up the land. This is:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/planning/33706.aspx" title="Environment Agency - Land contamination">Environment Agency</a> in England and Wales</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/land/contaminated_land.aspx" title="SEPA - Contaminated land">Scottish Environment Protection Agency</a> (<abbr title="Scottish Environment Protection Agency">SEPA</abbr>) in Scotland</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/land-home/land-quality/contaminated_land-2.htm" title="NIEA - Contaminated land">Northern Ireland Environment Agency</a> (<abbr title="Northern Ireland Environment Agency">NIEA</abbr>) in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>
<h2>Classification</h2>

<p>You could be classified as either a:</p>

<ul>
<li>Class A person - if you caused or allowed the contamination</li>
  <li>Class B person - if you currently own or use the land</li>
</ul>
<p>If the council or agency can’t identify a Class A person, a Class B person may become responsible for cleaning up the site.</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p>The council or agency will:</p>

<ul>
<li>decide how the land should be cleaned up</li>
  <li>serve a ‘remediation notice’ on the polluter or other appropriate person telling them how and by when they must clean up the land</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re responsible for part or all of the clean up, you can agree a voluntary scheme with your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">local council</a>. You must tell them what steps you will take to clean up the land. </p>


</article><article id="developing-land"><header><h1>Part 4: Developing land</h1>
  </header><p>You could have to clean up land contamination on your site before you can develop it. </p>

<p>Contact your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">local council</a> to discuss planning and to check what you must do to make sure the land is suitable for your proposed development. </p>

</article><article id="buying-contaminated-land"><header><h1>Part 5: Buying contaminated land</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re buying contaminated land, you could get financial help to clean it up and make sure it is suitable for use. </p>

<p>You could get:</p>

<ul>
<li>capital allowances</li>
  <li>an exemption from stamp duty</li>
  <li>enhanced tax relief</li>
</ul>
