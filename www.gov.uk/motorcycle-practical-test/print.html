</article><article id="what-happens-during-the-motorcycle-practical-test"><header><h1>Part 3: What happens during the motorcycle practical test</h1>
  </header><p>The practical motorcycle test is split into 2 separate modules - the <strong>off-road module</strong> and the <strong>on-road module</strong>. To get a full motorcycle licence you need to pass both modules.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can book both modules at the same time, but you must pass module 1 before you take module 2.</p>
</div>

<p>If you don’t pass module 1, you must wait 3 full working days before you can retake it.</p>

<h2>Cancelling module 2</h2>

<p>You have to give 3 full working days’ notice to cancel your module 2 test. Otherwise you’ll lose your module 2 test fee.</p>

<p>You should leave a long enough time between the 2 modules so you don’t lose the module 2 fee if you don’t pass module 1 first time.</p>

<p>If you don’t pass module 2, you have to wait 10 full working days before you can take it again.</p>

<h2>Reporting for your riding test modules</h2>

<p>You need to bring <a href="/motorcycle-practical-test/documents-you-need-to-take-to-your-test" title="certain documents">certain documents</a> with you and a <a href="/motorcycle-practical-test/rules-for-mopeds-and-motorcycles-used-in-the-practical-riding-test" title="suitable moped or motorcycle">suitable moped or motorcycle</a>.</p>

<h3>Clothing rules</h3>

<p>You should wear appropriate motorcycle clothing to your test.</p>

<p>If you don’t wear the right clothing for your test it might be cancelled and you could lose your fee.</p>

<h2>Module 1: off-road manoeuvres</h2>

<p>Module 1 is the off-road module and normally takes about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>It includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>wheeling the moped or motorcycle and using the stand</li>
  <li>riding a slalom and figure of 8</li>
  <li>a slow ride</li>
  <li>a U-turn</li>
  <li>cornering and controlled stop</li>
  <li>cornering and the emergency stop</li>
  <li>cornering and hazard avoidance</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a minimum speed for the hazard avoidance and emergency stop exercises:</p>

<ul>
<li>for mopeds this is around 19mph</li>
  <li>for motorcycles this is around 31mph</li>
</ul>
<h3>Motorcycle manoeuvring area</h3>

<p>Module 1 takes place in a safe off-road area called a motorcycle manoeuvring area. The layout of the area depends on where you take your test.</p>

<p>You can download diagrams showing the different types of layout.</p>

<h2>Module 2: on-road riding</h2>

<p>Module 2 is the on-road module and normally takes about 40 minutes.</p>

<p>You must bring your module 1 pass certificate to module 2, plus all the documents you had to bring to the module 1 test.</p>

<h2>What happens during module 2</h2>

<p>Module 2 includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>eyesight test</li>
  <li>safety and balance questions</li>
  <li>road riding</li>
  <li>independent riding</li>
</ul>
<h3>The eyesight test</h3>

<p>You’ll have to correctly read a number plate on a parked vehicle.</p>

<p>The vehicle will be at least 20 metres away if it has a new-style number plate, and 20.5 metres away if it has an old-style number plate.</p>

<p>New-style number plates start with 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, for example AB51 ABC.</p>

<p>If you can’t pass the eyesight test you’ll fail your test and the test won’t continue.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you can’t speak English or have difficulty reading, you can write down what you see.</p>
</div>

<h3>Vehicle safety and balance questions</h3>

<p>You can download a list of all the safety and balance questions you could be asked by the examiner.</p>

</div>

<h3>Road riding</h3>

<p>You’ll ride in a variety of road and traffic conditions. You’ll be asked to carry out:</p>

<ul>
<li>normal stops</li>
  <li>an angle start (pulling out from behind a parked vehicle)</li>
  <li>a hill start (where possible)</li>
</ul>
<p>The examiner will give you directions using a radio. They will normally follow you on a motorcycle.</p>

<h3>Independent riding</h3>

<p>You’ll have about 10 minutes of <a href="/motorcycle-practical-test/independent-riding-section-of-the-test" title="independent riding">independent riding</a>. This is designed to assess your ability to ride safely while making your own decisions.</p>

<h3>At the end of module 2</h3>

<p>At the end of module 2, the examiner will give you the result and feedback. If you pass, the examiner will explain to you how to change your provisional licence into a full licence.</p>

<h2>Your riding test result</h2>

<p>At the end of each module the examiner will tell you if you’ve passed or not and give you feedback on your riding.</p>

<p>When you pass module 1, you’ll get your module 1 pass certificate which you’ll need when you take module 2.</p>

<p>When you pass module 2, you’ll be told how to <a href="/claiming-driving-test-pass" title="claim your driving test pass">claim your test pass</a> and get your full licence.</p>

<h3>Types of faults</h3>

<p>There are 3 types of faults that can be marked:</p>

<ul>
<li>a dangerous fault - involves actual danger to you, the examiner, the public or property</li>
  <li>a serious fault - could potentially be dangerous</li>
  <li>a rider fault - not potentially dangerous, but if you make the same fault throughout your test it could become a serious fault</li>
</ul>
<h3>Module 1 pass mark</h3>

<p>You need to make 5 or fewer rider faults to pass module 1.</p>

<p>You’ll automatically fail if you make 1 serious or dangerous fault.</p>

<h3>Module 2 pass mark</h3>

<p>You need to make 10 or fewer rider faults to pass module 2.</p>

<p>You’ll automatically fail if you make 1 serious or dangerous fault.</p>


</article><article id="independent-riding-section-of-the-test"><header><h1>Part 4: Independent riding section of the test</h1>
  </header><p>Your practical motorcycle test will include approximately 10 minutes of independent riding. It’s not a test of your orientation and navigation skills.</p>

<h2>How the test works</h2>

<p>During your test you’ll have to ride independently by either following:</p>

<ul>
<li>traffic signs</li>
  <li>a series of directions</li>
  <li>a combination of both</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you understand where you are going when following verbal directions, the examiner will show you a diagram.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can’t use sat nav because the independent riding section tests how you make your own decisions.</p>
</div>

<h3>If you forget the directions</h3>

<p>It doesn’t matter if you don’t remember every direction, or if you go the wrong way - that can happen to the most experienced riders.</p>

<p>Independent riding is not a test of your orientation and navigation skills. Riding independently means making your own decisions - this includes deciding when it’s safe and appropriate to ask for confirmation about where you’re going.</p>

<p>If you ask for a reminder of the directions, the examiner will confirm them to you.</p>

</div>

<h3>If you go off the independent riding route</h3>

<p>If you go off the independent riding route it won’t affect the result of your test unless you make a riding fault.</p>

<p>If you go off the route or take a wrong turning, the examiner will help you get back on the route. You can then continue with the independent riding.</p>

<h3>If there are poor traffic signs</h3>

<p>If there are poor or obscured traffic signs, the examiner will give you directions until you can see the next traffic sign. You won’t need to have a detailed knowledge of the area.</p>

</article><article id="your-test-result"><header><h1>Part 5: Your test result</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll pass your test if you make:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 or less riding faults on module 1</li>
  <li>10 or less riding faults on module 2</li>
  <li>no serious or dangerous faults</li>
</ul>
<p>When the test has ended, you can call your instructor over. This is so they can listen to the result and help you with any feedback afterwards.</p>

<p>The examiner will:</p>

<ul>
<li>tell you if you passed or not</li>
  <li>explain how you did during the test</li>
</ul>
<h2>The different types of faults</h2>

<p>There are 3 types of faults that can be marked:</p>

<ul>
<li>a dangerous fault - involves actual danger to you, the examiner, the public or property</li>
  <li>a serious fault - could potentially be dangerous</li>
  <li>a driving fault - not potentially dangerous, but if you make the same fault throughout your test it could become a serious fault</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you pass your test</h2>

<p>If you pass your test the examiner will give you a pass certificate. They will also ask you if you want your full licence to be sent to you automatically.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Once you have passed your test you can start riding straight away - you don’t need to wait for your full licence to arrive.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you don’t pass</h2>

<p>If you don’t pass, you have to wait another 10 working days before you can take another test. Working days include Saturdays.</p>

<h2>Feedback on how eco-efficient your riding is</h2>

<p>The examiner will also give you feedback about how eco-efficient your riding is.</p>

</article><article id="cancelled-or-stopped-tests-and-bad-weather"><header><h1>Part 10: Cancelled or stopped tests and bad weather</h1>
  </header><p>Sometimes the Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>) has to cancel or stop motorcycle practical tests because of bad weather, vehicle problems or other reasons.</p>

<h2>Bad weather</h2>

<p>Practical riding tests are not held in dangerous weather conditions, for example when the roads are icy.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If your test is cancelled because of bad weather, another will be arranged automatically at no further cost.</p>
</div>

<p>Only call your test centre if there is snow or ice in your local area on the day of your test.</p>

<h2>When to phone your test centre</h2>

<p>If your test is early in the morning, call as soon as you can on the day. If you call the day before, the test centre won’t be able to tell you if your test will go ahead.</p>

<p>If your test is in the afternoon, call the test centre later in the morning. The test centre is more likely to know if the roads will be suitable for your test.</p>

<h3>If there’s no answer from the test centre</h3>

<p>If nobody answers the phone, and the conditions in your area aren’t looking too bad, it’s likely that the examiners are:</p>

<ul>
<li>checking the local roads to see if practical tests can go ahead</li>
  <li>taking tests because the conditions are suitable</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this isn’t a guarantee that your test will go ahead. Call the test centre again or go there in time for your test.</p>

<h2>If your test can’t go ahead</h2>

<p>A new appointment date will usually be sent to you within 3 working days. This could take up to 7 days when the bad weather goes on for longer.</p>

<p>You won’t be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

<h2>Waiting times for a practical test</h2>

<p>As well as causing cancellations, bad weather can sometimes lead to longer waiting times for practical test appointments.</p>

<h2>If your test is cancelled by <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> for other reasons</h2>

<p>If your test is cancelled at short notice you might be able to claim out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

<p>‘Short notice’ means less than 3 clear working days’ notice. Working days include Saturdays, but don’t include public holidays.</p>

<p>You can’t claim if the test was cancelled because of:</p>

<ul>
<li>bad weather and poor light</li>
  <li>problems with your motorcycle</li>
  <li>rider problems</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll need to fill out and return a claim form to <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>.</p>
