If you call the day before, the test centre won't be able to tell you if your test will go ahead.\r\n\r\nIf your test is in the afternoon, call the test centre later in the morning. The test centre is more likely to know if the roads will be suitable for your test.\r\n\r\n###If there's no answer from the test centre\r\n\r\nIf nobody answers the phone, and the conditions in your area aren't looking too bad, it's likely that the examiners are:\r\n\r\n- checking the local roads to see if practical tests can go ahead\r\n- taking tests because the conditions are suitable\r\n\r\nHowever, this isn't a guarantee that your test will go ahead.
