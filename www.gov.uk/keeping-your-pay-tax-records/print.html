  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You need to keep records if you have to send HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) a Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<p>You’ll need your records to fill in your tax return correctly. If <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> checks your tax return, they may ask for the documents. </p>

<h2>How to keep your records</h2>

<p>There are no rules on how you must keep records. You can keep them on paper, digitally or as part of a software program (like book-keeping software). </p>

<p>If they aren’t accurate, complete and readable, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can charge you a penalty.</p>

<h2>Lost or destroyed records</h2>

<p>Try to get copies of as much as you can, eg ask banks for copies of statements, suppliers for duplicate invoice etc.</p>

<p>If you can’t recreate all your records, you can use ‘provisional’ or ‘estimated’ figures. You must use the ‘Any other information’ box on the tax return to say that this is what you’re doing.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>‘Provisional’ means you’ll be able to get paperwork to confirm your figures later. ‘Estimated’ means you won’t be able to confirm the figures.</p>
</div>

<p>If your figures turn out to be wrong and you haven’t paid enough tax, you may have to pay interest and penalties.</p>
