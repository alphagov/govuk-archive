  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>

<ul>
<li>construction </li>
  <li>demolition </li>
  <li>industry </li>
  <li>agriculture</li>
  <li>any commercial activity - including any you run from your home </li>
</ul>
<p>Your duty of care lasts from the moment the waste is produced to when it’s received by a business that is authorised to deal with it. For example, a licensed disposal site. </p>

</article><article id="duty-of-care"><header><h1>Part 2: Duty of care</h1>

  <li>fill in a <a href="/managing-your-waste-an-overview/transporting" title="Transporting waste">waste transfer note</a> for each load of waste you transport </li>
  <li>usually get a licence to transport, store, treat, recover or dispose of your waste yourself </li>

<ul>
<li>a single waste transfer note </li>
  <li>a season ticket waste transfer note - covers multiple transfers over a 12 month period </li>
</ul>

<p>Most waste can’t be imported or exported if it’s for disposal (eg landfill). In almost all cases, you can only move waste to recover it.
