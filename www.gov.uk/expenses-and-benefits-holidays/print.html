  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing holidays for your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>What you have to report and pay depends on whether you:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide a holiday, or vouchers that can be exchanged for a holiday</li>
  <li>arrange the holiday yourself, or your employee does</li>
  <li>pay for the holiday directly, or your employee pays for it and you pay them back</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>If you arrange and pay for a holiday yourself for an employee who earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year, you don’t have to pay or report anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>


</article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If any of the holidays you provide aren’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-holidays/whats-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you may have to report the costs to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and deduct or pay tax and National Insurance on them.</p>

<h2>Holiday vouchers</h2>

<p>You’ll always need to report and pay if you provide your employees with vouchers they can exchange for a holiday.</p>

<ul>
<li>add the amount you pay the employee to their other earnings</li>
