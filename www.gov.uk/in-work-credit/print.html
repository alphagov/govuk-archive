<h2>How you’re paid</h2>

<p>All benefits, pensions and allowances are paid <a href="/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid" title="How to have your benefits paid">into an account</a>, eg your bank account.</p>

</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>

  <li>work at least 16 or more hours a week on average</li>

  <li>claim it within 5 weeks of starting your job</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2>Qualifying benefits</h2>

<p>You must have:</p>

<ul>
<li>been getting a qualifying benefit for at least 52 weeks before starting work</li>
  <li>started claiming the qualifying benefit on or before 1 October 2012</li>
</ul>
<h3>London</h3>

<p>To qualify, you must stop getting one of these benefits before you start work:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/employment-support-allowance" title="Employment and Support Allowance">Employment and Support Allowance</a></li>
  <li><a href="/incapacity-benefit" title="Incapacity Benefit">Incapacity Benefit</a></li>
  <li><a href="/severe-disablement-allowance" title="Severe Disablement Allowance">Severe Disablement Allowance</a></li>
  <li><a href="/jobseekers-allowance" title="Jobseeker's Allowance">Jobseeker’s Allowance</a></li>
  <li><a href="/income-support" title="Income Support">Income Support</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Outside London</h3>

<p>To qualify, you must stop getting one of these benefits before you start work: </p>

<ul>
<li>Jobseeker’s Allowance </li>
  <li>Income Support </li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) paid for under 13 weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Employment and Support Allowance will only qualify if you got it because both of these apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>your child was too old for you to qualify for Income Support </li>

</ul>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
