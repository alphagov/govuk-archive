<p>Dhekelia Station is situated within the Eastern Sovereign Base Area, one of 2 British Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus, enshrined in the Treaty of Establishment between the UK and the Republic of Cyprus in 1960. Dhekelia itself is on the northern shore of the wide sweeping Larnaca Bay and is situated some 15km north east of the important coastal town of Larnaca and 20km West of Ayia Napa, the premier tourist resort for the club music scene in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Within the Eastern Sovereign Base Area there are two British Military stations at Ayios Nikolaos and Dhekelia, the latter being known as a ‘cantonment’. It consists of some 7 sq km and is home to the Headquarters of the Eastern Sovereign Base Area, a Resident Infantry Battalion, an Engineer Squadron, and various Logistic Units, as well as UK-based civilians and dependents, making a total British population of just over 1,500 people. </p>

<p>Dhekelia Cantonment has many excellent sporting and recreational facilities, with the emphasis, as you would expect, being very much on water sports. Amenities are constantly being enhanced and improved, with the aim being to create a village centre, so that shops, banks, the <abbr title="Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes">NAAFI</abbr> (Navy, Army &amp; Air Force Institutes), Post Office, travel agents, medical and dental centres and welfare services are all within easy walking distance.</p>
