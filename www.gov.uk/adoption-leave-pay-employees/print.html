  </header><h2>Statutory Adoption Leave</h2>

<p>Eligible employees can take up to 52 weeks Statutory Adoption Leave. The first 26 weeks is known as ‘Ordinary Adoption Leave’, the last 26 weeks as ‘Additional Adoption Leave’.</p>

<p>Leave can start: </p>

<ul>
<li>up to 14 days before the child starts living with the employee (UK adoptions)</li>
  <li>when the child arrives in the UK or within 28 days of this date (overseas adoptions) </li>
</ul>
<h2>Statutory Adoption Pay</h2>

<p>Statutory Adoption Pay for eligible employees is £135.45 a week or 90% of their gross average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) </p>

<p>It’s paid for up to 39 weeks of adoption leave. Tax and National Insurance need to be deducted. </p>

<h2>Extra leave or pay</h2>

<p>You can offer more than the statutory amounts if you have a company scheme for adoption leave and pay. You must make sure your scheme’s policies are clear and easily accessible to staff. </p>
