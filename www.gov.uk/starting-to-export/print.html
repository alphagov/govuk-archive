</article><article id="sending-goods-to-eu-countries"><header><h1>Part 2: Sending goods to EU countries</h1>
  </header><p>When sending goods within the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) you don’t have to pay duty and there are no customs checks. The goods are in ‘free circulation’. This also goes for goods from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> but only if duty has been paid on them. </p>

<p>Exports within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> are called ‘dispatches’. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Find information on doing business in <a href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/countries.html#eu" title="UK Trade &amp; Investment website">individual <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> markets</a> on  the UK Trade &amp; Investment website.</p>
</div>

<p>Regulations and product standards are the same in most <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states. If you sell products in the UK it’s likely that you already comply with standards in other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries (eg security for electrical goods). </p>

<h2>Paying VAT on dispatches within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You have to: </p>

<ul>
<li>record all the goods sold to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries on your <a href="/vat-returns" title="VAT return">VAT return</a> </li>
  <li>fill in an <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/international/esl/reporting-esl.htm" title="EC Sales List">EC Sales List</a>
</li>
  <li>fill in an <a href="/specialist/introduction-to-intrastat" title="Intrastat Declaration">Intrastat Declaration</a> if your total dispatches are worth more than £250,000 </li>
</ul>
<h3>Your customer is VAT registered</h3>

<p>If your customer is VAT registered in their country, they’ll pay VAT for the goods at their country’s rate. You don’t pay any VAT. You’ll need your customer’s VAT registration number for your VAT return and paperwork proving that the goods have been sent within certain time limits (usually 3 months).</p>

<h3>Your customer isn’t VAT registered</h3>

<p>If your customer isn’t VAT registered, you’ll normally have to pay UK VAT on the goods you export. You’ll only be exempt from paying VAT if you’re responsible for the delivery of the goods and their value is above a certain amount called the ‘distant selling threshold’. In this case your customer covers the VAT. The threshold varies in each <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country. </p>

<h2>Paying duty on dispatches within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>
<p>Goods that have been produced in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and are then sent to another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country are in free circulation and you don’t have to pay duty on them.</p>

<p>This also covers goods from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> if duty has already been paid on them. For example, an importer brings bicycles from China into the UK and pays duty on them. They are now in free circulation. You can buy the bicycles and dispatch them to France without paying duty on them. </p>

<p>If duty hasn’t been paid on goods arriving from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> you have to follow the rules for <a href="/starting-to-import/importing-from-noneu-countries" title="importing from non EU countries">importing goods from non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries.</a></p>

<h2>Commodity codes</h2>
<p>You need a <a href="/finding-commodity-codes" title="Find a commodity code">commodity code</a> for goods not in free circulation. The code classifies your goods for duty, tax rates and regulations (eg licences). </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Check if you need a <a href="/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence" title="Strategic exports: when to request an export licence">strategic export licence</a> for some controlled goods, eg military, defence or security related goods.

</div>


</article><article id="exporting-to-noneu-countries"><header><h1>Part 3: Exporting to non-EU countries</h1>
  </header><p>Exports to countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> are called exports to ‘third countries’. You need to submit an export declaration for these and may need an export licence. </p>

<p>You might also have to pay custom duties and taxes in the destination country.</p>

<p>Export regulations vary, depending on the country you’re exporting to. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can find information on doing business in <a href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/countries.html" title="UK Trade &amp; Investment website" rel="external">individual non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> markets</a>  on the UK Trade &amp; Investment website.</p>
</div>

<h2>Commodity codes</h2>
<p>You need a <a href="/finding-commodity-codes" title="Find a commodity code">commodity code</a> for all exports outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. The code classifies your goods for duty, tax rates and regulations (eg licences). </p>

<h2>Export licences</h2>
<p>Sometimes you might need a licence for exporting goods to a third country. For example, agricultural goods or valuable antiques often need one. You’ll have to get the licence from the relevant government organisation, eg <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-trade/" title="Department of Agriculture">Department for Agriculture</a> </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Check if you need a <a href="/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence" title="Strategic exports: when to request an export licence">strategic export licence</a> for some controlled goods, eg military, defence or security related goods. This also covers <a href="/controls-on-dual-use-goods" title="Controls on Dual-Use goods">Dual Use goods</a> that can be used for both civil and military purposes, eg some software. If you do need a strategic export licence, <a href="/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence" title="Strategic exports: when to request an export licence">read the guidance first</a> then <a href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login" title="SPIRE" rel="external">apply using SPIRE.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Export declarations</h2>
<p>If you want to export goods to a third country, you must submit an electronic export declaration. You do this by:</p>

<ul>
<li>registering for an <a href="/specialist/economic-operator-registration-and-identification-eori-scheme" title="Registering for an Economic Operator Registration Identification">Economic Operator Registration Identification number</a>(EORI)  </li>
  <li>registering for the <a href="/specialist/chief-trader-import-and-export-processing-system" title="CHIEF system">Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight system</a> (CHIEF)  </li>
  <li>submitting your export declaration through the National Export System (NES) - which is part of CHIEF</li>
</ul>
<p>Many businesses use an agent called a <a href="/freight-forwarders" title="Freight forwarders">freight forwarder</a> to handle these declarations for them. </p>

<p>Special rules apply if you’re moving goods via other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries before exporting them to a third country. This is called ‘indirect exports’.</p>

<p>There is more information on <a href="/specialist/export-declarations-and-the-national-export-system-export-procedures" title="Export declarations">submitting declarations through NES.</a></p>

<h2>Paying VAT on exports overseas</h2>
<p>You have to <a href="/vat-record-keeping" title="VAT record keeping">account for VAT</a> on your exports to non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries.</p>

<p>VAT for third country exports depends on how the goods are sent, eg if you send them directly or through an agent and if your customer collects the goods. </p>

<h2>Paying duty on exports to third countries</h2>
<p>Duty charges are set by the country you export to and depend on the type of goods, where they come from and their value.</p>

<p>The <a href="/trade-tariff" title="UK Trade Tariff">UK Trade Tariff</a> lists the duty charges, tax, custom rules and paperwork for exports to third countries. </p>

<p>You might be able to claim duty charges and VAT back or delay payments for some exports outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. </p>

<p>This is called <a href="/duty-relief-for-imports-and-exports" title="other duty relief schemes">‘duty relief’</a> and there are a number of schemes you can apply for. Some countries have trade agreements with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> that allow you to export at lower or zero duty rates. In these cases you must usually be able to prove where the goods originally come from. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Check if there are <a href="/sanctions-embargoes-and-restrictions" title="Sanctions, embargoes and restrictions">embargoes or sanctions</a> against exporting certain goods (eg military, defence or security related goods) to individual countries.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="exporting-via-other-eu-countries"><header><h1>Part 4: Exporting via other EU countries</h1>
  </header><p>Moving goods through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries is known as <a href="/specialist/exporting-goods-from-the-eu-to-a-third-country-outside-the-eu" title="Moving goods through the EU to non-EU countries">‘indirect exports’</a></p>

<p>Indirect exports need special procedures and paperwork, which generally depend on the final destination of your goods:</p>

<ul>
<li>you must fill in an export declaration - even though the goods are initially moving through an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country</li>
  <li>
<a href="/specialist/exporting-goods-from-the-eu-to-a-third-country-outside-the-eu" title="Export licences and other controls">export licences and other controls</a> will depend on the destination of your goods</li>
  <li>you won’t have to pay VAT on goods exported outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, though you’ll have to show proof that the goods actually left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you’ll need a {trade control licence](/trade-control-licences-for-brokering “Trade Control Licences for brokering”) if you’re moving strategically controlled goods (eg military or defence) between 2 non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries </li>
  <li>you might need a <a href="/transhipment-licences" title="Transhipment licences">transhipment licence</a> if you arrange the shipment of goods through the UK </li>
</ul>
