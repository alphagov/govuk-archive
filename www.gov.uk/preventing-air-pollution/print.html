  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="local-controls"><header><h1>Part 1: Local controls</h1>
  </header><p>Your local council can introduce extra controls on emissions if there are air quality problems in your area. </p>

<p>If air quality falls below required standards, local councils will declare an Air Quality Management Area (<abbr title="Air Quality Management Area (AQMA)">AQMA</abbr>) and make plans for improvements.</p>

<p>If your business is in an <abbr title="Air Quality Management Area (AQMA)">AQMA</abbr>, you could be affected by:</p>

<ul>
<li>road charging</li>
  <li>parking restraints</li>
  <li>increased restrictions on waiting and loading times</li>
  <li>taxes to encourage moving goods by rail</li>
  <li>the review of planning applications by a pollution control team</li>
</ul>

<h2>Smoke Control Areas</h2>
<p>Your local council can also declare a Smoke Control Area. This means that you can only use authorised fuels or exempted furnaces or boilers. In such areas, the emission of smoke from a chimney is not allowed, with only a few exceptions. </p>

<p>You could be fined up to £1,000 for each offence. </p>

<p>If you are a contractor and work at different locations you should check if you are in a <a rel="external" href="http://smokecontrol.defra.gov.uk/locations.php" title="Smoke control areas">Smoke Control Area.</a></p>


</article><article id="dark-smoke"><header><h1>Part 2: Dark smoke</h1>
  </header><p>The darker the smoke, the more polluting it tends to be. Smoke darker than a specified shade of grey is officially classified as ‘dark smoke’.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000000373338&amp;lang=_e" title="Ringelmann chart">Ringelmann chart</a> is used to define dark smoke. The chart has 5 shades of grey with 0 being clear and 5 being black. Smoke is considered ‘dark’ if it is shade 2 or darker. </p>

<h2>What you must do</h2>

<p>You must not release dark smoke from your premises, including from: </p>

<ul>
<li>chimneys serving furnaces</li>
  <li>fixed boilers or industrial plants, whether they are attached to buildings or not</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some exemptions if emissions won’t damage health or cause a nuisance.</p>

</article><article id="boilers-and-furnaces"><header><h1>Part 3: Boilers and furnaces</h1>
  </header><p>Most generators, furnaces or boilers need a permit from the Environment Agency or your local council.</p>

<h2>Get a permit</h2>
<p>Contact the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/contactus/default.aspx" title="Contact the Environment Agency">Environmental Agency</a> for a Part A(1) environmental permit if your appliances:</p>

<ul>
<li>have an aggregated rated thermal input of 50 megawatts (<abbr title="Megawatts">mw</abbr>) or more</li>
  <li>burn waste oil, recovered oil or any fuel made from waste, with a rated thermal input of 3 <abbr title="Megawatts">mw</abbr> to 50 <abbr title="Megawatts">mw</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact your <a href="/find-your-local-council">local council</a> for a Part B environmental permit if your appliances:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a rated thermal input of 20 <abbr title="Megawatts">mw</abbr> to 50 <abbr title="Megawatts">mw</abbr>
</li>
  <li>burn waste excluded from the Waste Incineration Directive (WID) with a rated thermal input of 0.4 <abbr title="Megawatts">mw</abbr> to 3 <abbr title="Megawatts">mw</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installing furnaces</h2>
<p>Your local council must approve:</p>

<ul>
<li>the use of a new non-domestic furnace in a building, fixed boiler or industrial plant</li>
  <li>changes to an existing furnace</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact your local council about grit and dust arrestment if you do not have an environmental permit and your furnace is going to be used to burn:</p>

<ul>
<li>pulverised fuel</li>
  <li>any other solid matter at a rate of 45.4 kilograms (<abbr title="Kilograms">kg</abbr>) or more an hour</li>
  <li>liquid or gaseous matter at a rate equivalent to 366.4 kilowatts (<abbr title="Kilowatts">kw</abbr>) or more</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chimney height requirements</h2>
<p>Your chimney must be high enough to prevent smoke, grit, dust, gases and fume emissions from damaging health or causing a nuisance. Your local council can refuse your application if the chimney is not high enough. </p>

<p>You must apply for chimney height approval if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you do not have an environmental permit</li>
  <li>your boiler’s fuel consumption exceeds 45.4 <abbr title="Kilograms">kg</abbr> of solid fuel per hour</li>
  <li>your boiler’s fuel consumption exceeds 366.4 <abbr title="Kilowatts">kw</abbr> of liquid or gas fuel per hour</li>
</ul>
<p>If your approval application is refused your local council will tell you the minimum chimney height you need.</p>

<p>A chimney may be exempt if it is used as part of:</p>

<ul>
<li>a temporary replacement, for example if the boiler or furnace is being repaired</li>
  <li>a temporary source of heat or power for building works</li>
  <li>an auxiliary plant to bring the main plant up to operating temperatures</li>
  <li>a mobile source of heat or power for agricultural purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>If your use of the chimney changes you must re-apply for approval.</p>

<h2>Boiler emission requirements</h2>
<p>You must fit all boilers with grit and dust arrestment equipment. You can apply to your <a href="/find-your-local-council">local council</a> for an exemption if the boiler will not create emissions that could damage health or cause a nuisance. </p>
