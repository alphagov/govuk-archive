  </header><p>In England and Scotland, valuation bands are based on property values on 1 April 1991, not what a property is worth today. In Wales, valuation bands are based on property values on 1 April 2003.</p>

<h2>England and Wales</h2>

<p>You can challenge a <a href="/council-tax-bands" title="Council Tax bands">Council Tax band</a> by:</p>

<ul>
<li>asking the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) to check it – eg if you think your home was valued incorrectly  </li>
  <li>making a formal challenge to the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> – you can only do this in certain circumstances (eg if your property has changed significantly since it was valued)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ask the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> to check your Council Tax band</h3>

<p>Contact the <a rel="external" href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/corporate/contact/index.html" title="VOA"><abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>.</a></p>

<p>They will tell you how your Council Tax band has been worked out. They can review your band if you provide information that suggests it’s wrong (eg evidence that similar properties in your street are in a different band).</p>

<p>If they agree your band is wrong, they’ll put it right. This service is free. Your council will then update your Council Tax bill.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can’t appeal against this decision, but in some cases you may be able to make a formal challenge to the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Make a formal challenge to the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>First, check your Council Tax band on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/cti/InitS.asp?lcn=0" title="Check your Council Tax band"><abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr></a> website, then follow the link ‘Do you think this Council Tax band is wrong?’</p>

<p>There are certain circumstances when you can formally challenge a band (eg if your property’s been demolished or converted into flats) - use the <a rel="external" href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/cti/checkroute.asp?lcn=0" title="Council Tax band - formal challenge checklist result">checklist</a> to see if this applies to you. </p>

<p>In England, if you make a formal challenge and disagree with the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>’s decision, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.valuationtribunal.gov.uk/A1Form.aspx/" title="Appeal to the Valuation Tribunal">appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal.</a> You’ll need to appeal within 3 months of the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>’s decision. </p>

</div>

<p>The Tribunal provides a free service and can’t award costs.</p>

<p>In Wales, the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> decides most challenges without having to go to tribunal. If you and <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> can’t agree, your challenge will be heard by a local valuation tribunal.</p>

<p>If the tribunal agrees with you, the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> will change your band and the council will update your bill. </p>

<h2>Scotland</h2>

<p>Check your Council Tax band on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.saa.gov.uk/" title="Scottish Assessors">Scottish Assessors</a> website, then follow the link ‘Make a proposal’.</p>

<p>Your proposal will go to the local Assessor. If it can’t be resolved through discussion, it will be sent to the local Valuation Appeal Committee for a decision. </p>


</article><article id="appeal-a-bill"><header><h1>Part 2: Appeal a bill</h1>
  </header><p>If you think your Council Tax bill is wrong, tell your council immediately – for example, if you think:</p>

<ul>
<li>the council is sending Council Tax bills to the wrong person for your home </li>
  <li>your home should not be charged Council Tax  </li>
  <li>the amount of the bill is wrong </li>
  <li>the council hasn’t reduced the bill even though a disabled person lives there</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You cannot appeal just because you think your Council Tax bill is too expensive.</p>
</div>

<p>To <a href="challenge-your-band" title="Council Tax Appeals: Challenging your band">appeal against your Council Tax band</a> contact the Valuation Office Agency.</p>

<h2>How to appeal your bill</h2>

<p>First, write to your council, saying why you think your bill is wrong.</p>

<p>The council may either:</p>

<ul>
<li>decide that the bill is wrong and send you a new one </li>
  <li>decide that the bill is right and explain why</li>
</ul>
<div class="advisory">
<p><strong>If the council decides your bill is wrong, you must continue to pay the amounts listed in your original bill until the new bills arrives.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>The council has 2 months to reply. If you disagree with the council’s decision, or you don’t hear back within 2 months, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.valuationtribunal.gov.uk/A1Form.aspx" title="Appeal to the Valuation Tribunal">appeal to the Valuation Tribunal.</a> </p>

<p>The Valuation Tribunal is an independent legal body, which means its decisions are not influenced by the council.</p>

<p>If the Tribunal agrees with you, the council will update your bill and adjust your monthly payments.</p>

<p>You must appeal within:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 months of the council telling you its decision </li>
  <li>4 months of you first writing to the council (if you haven’t had a response)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re appealing because the council hasn’t replied, you should tell the Valuation Tribunal this when you appeal.</p>

</article><article id="appeal-a-fine-or-completion-notice-"><header><h1>Part 3: Appeal a fine or completion notice </h1>
  </header><p>Councils can also impose a fine (penalty) if you give false information or you don’t give them the information needed by law – like who lives in a house. </p>

<p>If you disagree, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.valuationtribunal.gov.uk/A1Form.aspx" title="Appeal to the Valuation Tribunal">appeal to the Valuation Tribunal.</a> You need to appeal within 28 days of getting the fine. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You won’t have to pay your fine until your appeal is decided.</p>
</div>

<h2>Appeal a completion notice</h2>

<p>If you’ve been given a completion notice and disagree with the date, you can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.valuationtribunal.gov.uk/A1Form.aspx" title="Appeal to the Valuation Tribunal">appeal to the Valuation Tribunal.</a></p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must pay Council Tax from the date on the notice while you appeal.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="the-valuation-tribunal"><header><h1>Part 4: The Valuation Tribunal</h1>
  </header><p>You can appeal by letter or on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.valuationtribunal.gov.uk/A1Form.aspx" title="Appeal to the Valuation Tribunal">Valuation Tribunal’s website.</a> </p>

<p>You should explain:</p>

<ul>
<li>what decision you’re appealing against </li>
  <li>why you disagree with the council’s decision</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also send the Tribunal a copy of any relevant paperwork, such as your Council Tax bill, completion or penalty notice.</p>

<h2>Tribunal hearings</h2>

<p>The Valuation Tribunal will contact you to arrange a hearing, normally within 6 months of getting your appeal. A hearing is a meeting where 3 members of the Valuation Tribunal listen to information from you and your local council.</p>

<p>It won’t cost you anything unless you want to hire someone like a solicitor.</p>

<p>You can ask the Valuation Tribunal to decide your case without you coming to a hearing.</p>

<h2>The Tribunal’s decision</h2>
<p>The Valuation Tribunal will send you its written decision, normally within 1 month of the hearing.</p>

<p>If the Tribunal agrees with you, it will order the council to make the changes it’s decided.</p>

<p>If you disagree with the Tribunal’s decision, you can only appeal through the High Court. To be successful, you’d have to show that the Tribunal made a mistake in law.</p>

<h2>Help and advice</h2>
<p>The Valuation Tribunal can’t give legal advice, but it can explain how the appeal process works.</p>
