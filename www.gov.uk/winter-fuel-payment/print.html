  </header><p>You could get between £100 and £300 tax-free to help pay your heating bills if you were born on or before 5 July 1951. This known as a ‘Winter Fuel Payment’ and you don’t have to pay it back.</p>

<p>Most payments are made automatically between November and December. You should get your money by Christmas. </p>

<p>You should get a Winter Fuel Payment automatically if you get the State Pension or another social security benefit (not Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit or Child Benefit).</p>

<p>If you <a href="/winter-fuel-payment/eligibility" title="eligibility">qualify</a> but don’t get paid automatically, you’ll need to <a href="/winter-fuel-payment/how-to-claim" title="find out how to claim">make a claim</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Any money you get won’t affect your other benefits.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>How much you get depends on your circumstances during the qualifying week. For winter 2012 to 2013 this was 17 to 23 September 2012.</p>
