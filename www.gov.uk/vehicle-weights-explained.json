{"alternative_title":"","body":"$!Vehicle categories on driving licences can depend on the weight of the vehicle - the different terms you might see are explained below.$!\r\n\r\n##Unladen weight\r\n\r\nThe unladen weight of any vehicle is the weight of the vehicle when it\u2019s not carrying any passengers, goods or other items.\r\n\r\nIt includes the body and all parts normally used with the vehicle or trailer when it\u2019s used on a road.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t include the weight of the fuel or, if it\u2019s an electric vehicle, the batteries.\r\n\r\n##Maximum authorised mass\r\n\r\nMaximum authorised mass (MAM) means the weight of a vehicle or trailer including the maximum load that can be carried safely when it\u2019s being used on the road. \r\n\r\nThis is also known as gross vehicle weight (GVW) or permissible maximum weight.\r\n\r\nIt will be listed in the owner\u2019s manual and is normally shown on a plate or sticker fitted to the vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe plate or sticker may also show a gross train weight (GTW), also sometimes called gross combination weight (GCW). This is the total weight of the tractor unit plus trailer plus load.\r\n\r\n##Down-plating\r\n\r\nIf a vehicle is unlikely to be used at its potential maximum weight, it may be \u2018down-plated\u2019. This means that a lower weight is shown on the plate or sticker attached to the vehicle.\r\n\r\n*[MAM]: Maximum Authorised Mass\r\n*[GVW]: Gross Vehicle Weight\r\n*[GTW]: Gross Train Weight\r\n*[GCW]: Gross Combination Weight","overview":"Explanations of the different terms you might see on your driving licence","slug":"vehicle-weights-explained","title":"Vehicle weights explained","updated_at":"2012-10-02T12:14:41+00:00","type":"answer"}
