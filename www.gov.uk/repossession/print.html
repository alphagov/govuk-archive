</ul></article><article id="before-it-goes-to-court"><header><h1>Part 2: Before it goes to court</h1>
  </header><h2>What your mortgage lender must do</h2>
<p>Before they can repossess your home, they must:</p>

<ul>
<li>tell you how much you owe </li>
  <li>consider a request from you to change the way you pay your mortgage</li>
  <li>respond to any offer of payment you make</li>
  <li>give you reasons for turning down your offer of payment within 10 days</li>
  <li>give you a reasonable amount of time to consider any proposal they make</li>
  <li>give you 15 days’ written warning if they plan to start court action </li>
  <li>tell you the date and time of the repossession hearing</li>
  <li>let your council know within 5 days of getting notification of the date of the court hearing, in case you need to apply to the council as homeless</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding a solution</h3>
<p>Even if your mortgage lender starts a court action, you may still be able to reach agreement with them.</p>

<p>You’ll still need to attend court to tell the judge, unless you’ve been told that the hearing’s been cancelled or postponed. </p>

<h2>Mortgage Rescue Scheme</h2>
<p>You may be able to avoid repossession through the <a href="/mortgage-rescue-scheme" title="Mortgage Rescue Scheme">Mortgage Rescue Scheme</a>. This is run by your local housing authority.</p>

<p>The scheme helps people in priority need through either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a loan to reduce your mortgage payments </li>
  <li>selling your home to a Registered Social Landlord, who then lets your home back to you </li>
</ul></article><article id="defence-form"><header><h1>Part 3: Defence form</h1>
  </header><p>If your lender starts a repossession action against you, the court will send you a blank defence form and guidance on how to fill it in.</p>

<p>You can use the form to explain why you think your home shouldn’t be repossessed. You need to return it within 14 days.</p>

<p>The court will also send you:</p>

<ul>
<li>copies of the claim forms for possessing your home, filled in by your lender  </li>
  <li>a court hearing date </li>
  <li>the court’s contact details  </li>
</ul></article><article id="help-with-legal-costs"><header><h1>Part 4: Help with legal costs</h1>
  </header><h2>Legal aid</h2>

<p>If you’re on a low income you may be able to get <a href="/legal-aid" title="Legal aid">legal aid.</a></p>

<h2>Free legal advice on the day</h2>
<p>If you haven’t got help before, you can get last-minute legal help under the Housing Possession Court Duty scheme. </p>

<p>The scheme runs in county courts in England and Wales. It provides you with a specialist adviser on the day of your hearing who can:</p>

<ul>
<li>represent you  </li>
  <li>help you come to an arrangement with your mortgage lender to pay off your debts </li>
</ul>
<p>To find out about the scheme in your area, contact your <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1" title="Find your local council">local council</a> or the court where your case is being heard.</p>

</article><article id="the-hearing"><header><h1>Part 5: The hearing</h1>
  </header><p>Repossession hearings normally take place in a judge’s chambers, not in the court room (although it’s treated as a court).</p>

<p>You can bring an adviser or friend to the hearing, although they must be an adult.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you don’t attend the court hearing, it’s likely the judge will give your mortgage lender the right to evict you.</p>
</div>

<p>You must keep to any agreement you make in court to pay off arrears. If you don’t, you may still risk losing your home.</p>

<h2>What to bring with you</h2>
<p>You’ll likely be asked for proof of your finances. This can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>payslips </li>
  <li>bank statements </li>
  <li>job offers </li>
  <li>letters about benefits </li>
  <li>estate agent letter (eg if you’re trying to sell your home to pay off the mortgage) </li>
</ul></article><article id="repossession-orders"><header><h1>Part 6: Repossession orders</h1>
  </header><p>Your home can only be repossessed if the court grants permission.</p>

<p>The judge could decide to:</p>

<ul>
<li>adjourn (delay) the hearing</li>
  <li>set aside the case, which means no order will be made and the hearing is finished </li>
  <li>make a repossession order</li>
</ul>
<h2>Outright possession order</h2>
<p>This gives the lender a legal right to own your home on the date given in the order. This is usually 28 days after your court hearing. </p>

<p>If you don’t leave your home by the date given in the order, your lender can ask the court to evict you. </p>

<h2>Suspended possession order</h2>
<p>This means that if you make regular payments as set out in the order, you can stay in your home. </p>

<p>If you don’t make the payments, your lender can ask the court to evict you.</p>

<h2>Challenging the judge’s decision</h2>
<p>You can ask a judge to delay eviction or allow you to stay in your home if you become able to make payments again. A new hearing will be held.</p>

<p>If you think a judge made mistakes about the law or the facts of your case in the original hearing, you may be able to appeal.</p>

</article><article id="if-your-home-is-repossessed"><header><h1>Part 7: If your home is repossessed</h1>
  </header><h2>Help from your council</h2>
<p>Your <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1" title="Find your local council">local council</a> must give you advice to help you find a new home.</p>

<p>Depending on your circumstances, they may also be able to provide you with emergency accommodation or a more permanent home.</p>

<h2>Buying another property</h2>
<p>You must tell any new mortgage lender that your previous home was repossessed. This could make getting a new mortgage hard.</p>

<p>If you still owe money to your previous lender, they may be able to claim some of the proceeds of your new home when you sell it.</p>
