</ul></article><article id="before-it-goes-to-court"><header><h1>Part 2: Before it goes to court</h1>
  </header><h2>What your mortgage lender must do</h2>
<p>Before a mortgage lender can repossess your home, they must:</p>

<ul>
<li>tell you how much you owe </li>
  <li>consider a request from you to change the way you pay your mortgage</li>
  <li>respond to any offer of payment you make</li>
  <li>give you reasons for turning down your offer of payment within 10 days</li>
  <li>give you a reasonable amount of time to consider any proposal they make</li>
  <li>give you 15 days’ written warning if they plan to start court action </li>
  <li>tell you the date and time of a repossession hearing</li>
  <li>let your council know within 5 days of getting notification of the date of the court hearing, in case you need to apply to the council as homeless</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding a solution</h3>
<p>Even if your mortgage lender starts a court action, you may still be able to reach agreement with them.</p>

<p>You’ll still need to attend court to tell the judge about the agreement, unless the court tells you the hearing’s been cancelled or postponed. </p>

<h2>Mortgage Rescue Scheme</h2>
<p>You may be able to avoid repossession through the <a href="/mortgage-rescue-scheme" title="Mortgage Rescue Scheme">Mortgage Rescue Scheme</a>. This is run by your local housing authority.</p>

<p>The scheme helps people in <a href="/mortgage-rescue-scheme/eligibility" title="Eligibility for Mortgage Rescue Scheme">priority need</a>. You either:</p>

<ul>
<li>get a loan to reduce your mortgage payments </li>
  <li>sell your home to a Registered Social Landlord, who then lets your home back to you </li>
</ul></article><article id="defence-form"><header><h1>Part 3: Defence form</h1>
  </header><p>If your lender starts a repossession action against you, the court will send you a blank defence form and guidance on how to fill it in.</p>

<p>You can use the form to explain why you think the lender shouldn’t repossess your home. You need to return it within 14 days.</p>

<p>The court will also send you:</p>

<ul>
<li>copies of the claim forms for possessing your home, filled in by your lender  </li>
  <li>a court hearing date </li>
  <li>the court’s contact details  </li>
</ul></article><article id="help-with-legal-costs"><header><h1>Part 4: Help with legal costs</h1>
  </header><h2>Legal aid</h2>

<p>If you’re on a low income you may be able to get <a href="/legal-aid" title="Legal aid">legal aid.</a></p>

<h2>Free legal advice on the day</h2>
<p>If you haven’t got help before, you can get last-minute legal help under the Housing Possession Court Duty scheme. </p>

<p>The scheme runs in county courts in England and Wales. It provides you with a specialist adviser on the day of your hearing who can:</p>

<ul>
<li>represent you  </li>
  <li>help you come to an arrangement with your mortgage lender to pay off your debts </li>
</ul>
<p>To find out about the scheme in your area, contact your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">local council</a> or the court where your case is being heard.</p>

</article><article id="the-hearing"><header><h1>Part 5: The hearing</h1>
  </header><p>Repossession hearings normally take place in a judge’s chambers, not in a court room (although it’s treated as a court).</p>

<p>You can bring an adviser or friend to the hearing, although they must be an adult.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you don’t attend the court hearing, it’s likely the judge will give your mortgage lender the right to evict you.</p>
</div>

<p>You must keep to any agreement you make in court to pay off arrears. If you don’t, you may still risk losing your home.</p>

<h2>What to bring with you</h2>
<p>You’ll likely be asked for proof of your finances. This can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>payslips </li>
  <li>bank statements </li>
  <li>job offers </li>
  <li>letters about benefits </li>
  <li>estate agent letter (eg if you’re trying to sell your home to pay off the mortgage) </li>
</ul></article><article id="repossession-orders"><header><h1>Part 6: Repossession orders</h1>
  </header><p>The lender can only repossess your home if the court grants permission.</p>

<p>The judge could decide to:</p>

<ul>
<li>adjourn (delay) the hearing</li>
  <li>set aside the case, which means no order will be made and the hearing is finished </li>
  <li>make a repossession order</li>
</ul>
<h2>Outright possession order</h2>
<p>This gives the lender a legal right to own your home on the date given in the order and is sometimes called an ‘order for possession’. This is usually 28 days after your court hearing. </p>

<p>If you don’t leave your home by the date given in the order, your lender can ask the court to evict you. </p>

<h2>Suspended possession order</h2>
<p>This means that if you make regular payments as set out in the order, you can stay in your home. </p>

<p>If you don’t make the payments, your lender can ask the court to evict you.</p>

<h2>Money order</h2>
<p>This means that you have to pay the lender the amount set out in the order. If you don’t make these payments, court action could be taken like:</p>

<ul>
<li>deducting money from your wages or bank account</li>
  <li>sending bailiffs to take away things you own</li>
</ul>
<p>Your lender can’t use a money order to evict you from your home. If you don’t make payments set out in a money order on time, your lender could go to court again. As a result, the judge could decide to give them a possession order.</p>

<h2>Possession order with money judgment</h2>
<p>A money judgment is usually added to a possession order. It means you owe a specific amount of money usually made up of:</p>

<ul>
<li>your mortgage arrears </li>
  <li>court fees</li>
  <li>your lender’s legal costs</li>
</ul>
<p>A money judgment won’t apply if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you pay your mortgage arrears and any amount set out in a suspended order</li>
  <li>your lender sells your home and the sale price is more than the amount set out in the money judgment</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t pay the amount set out in the money judgment, the lender may ask the court to carry out the instructions in the possession order and the judgment.</p>

<h2>Time order</h2>
<p>This means that the judge changes the amount you pay on your mortgage for a set time by:</p>

<ul>
<li>changing the regular amount you pay</li>
  <li>changing the interest rate on your mortgage</li>
  <li>delaying the next time you have to make a payment</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t make the payments, your lender can ask the court to evict you.</p>

<p>A time order is usually only made on some types of loan like a second mortgage.</p>


</article><article id="delaying-eviction"><header><h1>Part 7: Delaying eviction</h1>
  </header><p>You can ask a judge to ‘suspend the warrant for possession’. This means delaying the eviction or allowing you to stay in your home if you are able to make payments again. </p>

<p>A new hearing will be held but the judge won’t automatically agree to suspend the possession warrant – it depends what happens in court.</p>

<p>If you want to get a warrant suspended, get <a href="/repossession/get-advice" title="Get advice">advice</a> immediately.</p>

<h2>Applying for a suspension</h2>
<p>If you want to apply for a suspension, you should fill out an application form and either send it or deliver it to the court. </p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=484" title="Download 'Apply to suspend a possession warrant' (PDF, 380KB)" rel="external">Download ‘Application notice’ (PDF, 380KB)</a></p>
</div>

<p>You must tell the court that you need a hearing at short notice (before your eviction date). You’ll have to pay a court fee. </p>

<p>If you’re on benefits or low pay, you may not have to pay the fee (otherwise known as ‘fee remission’).</p>

</article><article id="appealing-a-judges-decision"><header><h1>Part 8: Appealing a judge's decision</h1>
  </header><p>If you think a judge made mistakes about the law or the facts of your case in the original hearing, you may be able to appeal. <a href="/repossession/get-advice" title="Get advice">Get legal advice</a> if you want to appeal.</p>

<p>Normally the appeal will be heard by a more senior judge.</p>

<h2>Permission to appeal</h2>
<p>You can ask the judge at the end of your original possession hearing if you can appeal. </p>

<p>If the judge refuses to give permission to appeal, you can appeal to a more senior judge.</p>

<p>If you get permission, make an application as soon as possible after your original possession hearing. You’ll have to pay a court fee. </p>

<p>If you are on benefits or low pay, you may not have to pay the fee.</p>

<h2>What could happen</h2>
<p>At the appeal, the judge can make a number of decisions including:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping the original decision</li>
  <li>dismissing the previous decision or changing it</li>
  <li>ordering a new hearing</li>
</ul>
<p>The judge can also decide who pays the legal costs of the appeal. </p>


</article><article id="if-your-home-is-repossessed"><header><h1>Part 9: If your home is repossessed</h1>
  </header><h2>Help from your council</h2>
<p>Your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">local council</a> must give you advice to help you find a new home.</p>

<p>Depending on your circumstances, they may also be able to provide you with emergency accommodation or a more permanent home.</p>

<h2>Buying another property</h2>
<p>You must tell any new mortgage lender that your previous home was repossessed. This could make getting a new mortgage hard.</p>

<p>If you still owe money to your previous lender, they may be able to claim some of the proceeds of your new home when you sell it.</p>
