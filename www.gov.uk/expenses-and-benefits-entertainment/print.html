  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer covering the costs of your employees providing entertainment for clients, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>Entertainment can involve eating, drinking and other hospitality.</p>

<p>Types of entertainment include:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘business entertainment’ of clients - eg discussing a particular business project or forming or maintaining a business connection</li>
  <li>‘non-business entertainment’ of clients - eg entertaining a business acquaintance for social reasons</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report or pay anything to <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> if the employee you provide expenses for earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 and it’s:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘business entertainment’</li>
  <li>‘non-business entertainment’ but you pay and arrange it</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the entertainment isn’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-entertainment/whats-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you must report it to <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and you may have to deduct and pay tax and National Insurance on it.</p>

<h2>Business entertainment of clients</h2>

<p>The same rules apply regardless of whether you:</p>

<ul>
<li>arrange and pay for the entertainment directly</li>
  <li>pay the supplier for entertainment arranged by your employee</li>
  <li>reimburse your employee’s entertainment costs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-business entertainment – employee arranges and pays, you reimburse</h2>

<p>The amount you reimburse counts as earnings, so:</p>

<ul>
<li>add it to your employee’s other earnings</li>
  <li>deduct and pay <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax and Class 1 National Insurance through payroll</li>
</ul>
<h2>Note about form P11D</h2>

<p>Please note that there’s an entertainment-related tick-box on form P11D, section N. This is used by <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to determine whether or not your employee will be able to claim a tax deduction for the entertainment expenses you’ve provided.</p>

<p>There’s no need to enter anything in the box if you’re completing this form for a charity or a tonnage tax company, but otherwise:</p>

<ul>
<li>put a tick in the box if the cost of the entertainment will be disallowed in your business’s tax calculations</li>
  <li>put a cross in the box if it won’t be disallowed</li>
