  </header><h2>Statutory Paternity Leave</h2>

<p>Eligible employees get either 1 or 2 weeks consecutive leave - even if they have more than one child (eg twins). </p>

<p>Other types of leave can be taken before or after paternity leave (eg annual leave or parental leave) but not during. </p>

  <li>an agreed number of days after the birth</li>
