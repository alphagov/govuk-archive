<h2 id="history-of-the-military-stabilisation-support-group">History of the Military Stabilisation Support Group</h2>

<p>There is a long tradition of Specialist Military personnel being deployed by the military to support regeneration within broken and emerging communities.</p>

<h3 id="the-civil-affairs-group-cag">The Civil Affairs Group (<abbr title="The Civil Affairs Group">CAG</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Created in 1997 the Civil Affairs Group (<abbr title="The Civil Affairs Group">CAG</abbr>) supported operations in East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Balkans and Afghanistan. Working with host countries and international organisations, <abbr title="The Civil Affairs Group">CAG</abbr> provided a civil/military interface allowing the military to assess the impact of civilian activity on military plans. Officers and Senior Non Commissioned Officers (<abbr title="Senior Non Commissioned Officers">SNCO</abbr>) from the group provided advice and direction to Commanders throughout British and Multi-National Formations and Headquarters.</p>

<p>As part of this work, the group would assess the state of a country’s regional infrastructure, including population, essential services and resources; often acting as project managers and liaison officers with governmental and non-governmental organisations. </p>

<p>In 1997 the Groups establishment was 10 regular and 50 Territorial Army (<abbr title="Territorial Army">TA</abbr>) officers and <abbr title="Senior Non Commissioned Officers">SNCOs</abbr>. Although small and Reserve biased the structure gave the group enviable access to civilian skills and professions, it also developed strong working relationships with other specialist groups and units.As thinking evolved so too did the language - <abbr title="Civil Military Co-Operation">CIMIC</abbr> defined as </p>

<p>“The process whereby the relationships between military and civilian sectors is addressed with the aim of enabling a more coherent military contribution to the achievement of UK and/or International Objectives”</p>

<p>became the nomenclature and the initial doctrine was published. The regular and reserve components were increased. Ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan provided evidence of the fundamental importance of this work and as experience was gained the doctrine and philosophy developed.</p>

<h3 id="the-joint-cimic-group-jcg">The Joint <abbr title="Civil Military Co-Operation">CIMIC</abbr> Group (<abbr title="Joint CIMIC Group">JCG</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The Joint <abbr title="Civil Military Co-Operation">CIMIC</abbr> Group (<abbr title="Joint CIMIC Group">JCG</abbr>) was formed in 2004. <abbr title="Joint CIMIC Group">JCG</abbr> was tasked to support all deployable formations with specialist <abbr title="Civil Military Co-Operation">CIMIC</abbr> staff including provision of internal and external training to Defence.</p>

<p>The significant difference in the operating environment from the Balkans through Iraq to Afghanistan has seen the focus of <abbr title="Civil Military Co-Operation">CIMIC</abbr> change from being primarily an enabler for limited security and military operations to a broader role in support of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Approach">CA</abbr> adopted by the UK Government. </p>

<p>This evolution was spurred on by the creation of provincial reconstruction teams (<abbr title="provincial reconstruction teams">PRTs</abbr>) in Iraq in 2006 which saw the deployment of a mixed Regular and <abbr title="Territorial Army">TA</abbr> contingent to establish the UK <abbr title="provincial reconstruction team">PRT</abbr> in Basra alongside SU, FCO and DfID staff and US and Danish civilian experts; simultaneously <abbr title="Joint CIMIC Group">JCG</abbr> personnel deployed to Afghanistan to support the new <abbr title="provincial reconstruction team">PRT</abbr> in Helmand - a task that of course endures. <abbr title="Joint CIMIC Group">JCG</abbr> also deployed in support of the international effort after the Asian tsunami of Dec 2004.</p>

<p>In the lead up to Op MAR KARARDAD, the re-taking of Musa Quala in late 2007, it was recognised that a stabilisation plan needed to be designed and implemented soon after the town was secured. It became apparent that the situation would be far too dangerous for civilians to implement this stabilisation plan, so military personnel were charged with its implementation, which lead to the first Military Stabilisation Team. </p>

<p>This concept proved so successful that the Task Force and <abbr title="provincial reconstruction team">PRT</abbr> request 6 Teams to be established for each of the secured districts in Helmand. As security within each district was enhanced it became possible to base civilians from the <abbr title="provincial reconstruction team">PRT</abbr> forward in each of the District Centres, supported by the Military Stabilisation Teams and so developed the Military Stabilisation Support Team (MSST) concept.</p>

<p>In the UK, Defence recognised the need to resource and develop our stabilisation capabilities. Defence Strategic Guidance (<abbr title="Defence Strategic Guidance">DSG</abbr>) 2008 created the new military task of Military Assistance to Stabilisation and Development (<abbr title="Military Assistance to Stabilisation and Development">MASD</abbr>) to ensure that the Armed Forces developed the capability to support stabilisation and reconstruction efforts.</p>

<p>The new task formally recognised that the Armed Forces should plan and conduct operations to help stabilise and reconstruct in those locations where the security situation is too difficult to allow civilian agencies to work alone. <abbr title="Military Assistance to Stabilisation and Development">MASD</abbr> has three defined requirements: Military Assistance to Civil Effects (<abbr title="Military Assistance to Civil Effects">MACE</abbr>), Military Capacity Building (<abbr title="Military Capacity Building">MCB</abbr>) and Cultural understanding and specialisation. <abbr title="Military Assistance to Civil Effects">MACE</abbr> is the working term used to describe the tactical level military capability which assists civilians in the delivery of Civil Effect (<abbr title="Civil Effect">CE</abbr>). </p>

<p>Along side other Government Departments the MOD developed doctrine for Stabilisation, which resulted in the publication of JDP 3-40 The Military Contribution to Stabilisation and Security.</p>

<h3 id="the-military-stabilisation-support-group-mssg">The Military Stabilisation Support Group (<abbr title="The Military Stabilisation Support Group">MSSG</abbr>)</h3>

<p>On the 1st April 2009 the Military Stabilisation Support Group (<abbr title="The Military Stabilisation Support Group">MSSG</abbr>) was formed, following 8 months of successful training and operations. Soon after its formation the Group provided vital support to Operation PANTHERS CLAW, for which it was awarded the Firmin Sword of Peace.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="The Military Stabilisation Support Group">MSSG</abbr> current establishment consists of 65 Regular staff drawn from across the three services, up to 60 individual augmentees and 115 reserves predominately from the <abbr title="Territorial Army">TA</abbr>, but also from the RAF Reserves. The Group operates from Its Headquarters at Gibraltar Barracks, Camberley and delivers training and doctrinal responsibilities out of Corunna Barracks – Ludgershall, Tidworth. </p>

<p>The Group’s mission is:</p>

<p>“To prepare and deliver <abbr title="Military Assistance to Civil Effects">MACE</abbr> Planning Teams and functional specialists capable of providing stabilisation support to all deployed Formation and BG HQs in order to contribute to Permanent Joint Head Quarters (<abbr title="Permanent Joint Head Quarters">PJHQ</abbr>) and Joint Task Force (<abbr title="Joint Task Force">JTF</abbr>) operational capability.”</p>

<p>The group has an operational and a training role. Operationally it provides an ongoing presence in support of operations in Afghanistan in direct support of the Stabilisation Unit and the deployed Battle Groups and critically the Afghan Government itself.In terms of training it is responsible for providing the capability, the knowledge and lessons learnt on all matters pertinent to Stabilisation across defence. </p>

<p>In Theatre they provide the military focal point for civil engagement and outreach on behalf of both Afghan and UK civilians, by building credible and lasting relationships with the local communities in Helmand, and facilitating community based regeneration programmes in areas too dangerous for civilians to operate.</p>

<p>But its role is much wider than Afghanistan and the recent Strategic Defence and Security review highlighted the importance of providing Security for Stabilisation. It is responsible for stabilisation training across Defence and provides a deployable capability from JFHQ down to company level able to deliver Civil Effect and <abbr title="Civil Military Co-Operation">CIMIC</abbr> Planning Teams and functional specialists worldwide.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="The Military Stabilisation Support Group">MSSG</abbr> continues to develop close working relations with government departments, specifically the Stabilisation Unit with whom we have an embedded Liaison Officer and a strong working relationship.</p>
