There are different types of trusts and they are taxed differently.\r\n\r\nTrusts involve:\r\n\r\n- the \u2018settlor\u2019 - the person who puts assets into a trust\r\n- the \u2018trustee\u2019 - the person who looks after the trust\r\n- the \u2018beneficiary\u2019 - the person who the trust is for\r\n\r\n##What trusts are for\r\n\r\nTrusts are set up for a number of reasons, including:\r\n\r\n- to control and protect family assets\r\n- when someone's too young to handle their affairs\r\n- when someone can't handle their affairs because they're incapacitated\r\n- to pass on assets while you're still alive\r\n- to pass on assets when you die (a 'will trust')\r\n- under inheritance rules if someone dies without a will\r\n\r\n##What the settlor does\r\n\r\nThe settlor decides how the trust should be used - this is usually set out in a document called the 'trust deed'.\r\n\r\nSometimes the settlor can also benefit from the assets in a trust - this is called a 'settlor-interested' trust and has special tax rules. Find out more by reading the information on different [types of trust](types-of-trust \"types of trust\").\r\n\r\n##What trustees do\r\n\r\nThe trustees are the legal owners of the assets held in a trust. Their role is to:\r\n\r\n- deal with the assets according to the trust deed\r\n- manage the trust on a day-to-day basis and pay any tax due\r\n- decide how to invest or use the trust's assets\r\n\r\nIf the trustees change, the trust can still continue, but there always has to be at least 1 trustee.\r\n\r\n##Beneficiaries\r\n\r\nThere might be more than 1 beneficiary, like a whole family or defined group of people. They may benefit from:\r\n\r\n- the income of a trust only - eg from renting out a house held in a trust\r\n- the assets only - eg getting shares held in a trust when they reach a certain age\r\n- both the income and assets of the trust\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"The main types of trust are listed below - they're all taxed differently.\r\n\r\nRead the [overview](overview \"overview\") for definitions of 'trustee', 'settlor' and 'beneficiary'.\r\n\r\n##Bare trusts\r\n\r\nThese are where the assets in a trust are held in the name of a trustee but go directly to the beneficiary, who has a right to both the assets and income of the trust. \r\n\r\nBare trusts are often used to pass assets to young people - the trustees look after them until the beneficiary is 18 in England and Wales, or 16 in Scotland. \r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nGary leaves his sister Juliet some money in his will. The money is held in trust. \r\n\r\nAs the beneficiary Juliet is entitled to the money and any income (eg interest) it earns. \r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n##Interest in possession trusts\r\n\r\nThese are trusts where the beneficiary is entitled to trust income as it's produced, but not the assets, which pass to a different beneficiary in the future.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nStanley creates a trust for all the shares he owned. \r\n\r\nWhen he dies, the income from those shares goes to his wife for the rest of her life. When she dies, the shares will pass to their children.\r\n\r\nStanley's wife is the income beneficiary and has an 'interest in possession' in the trust. She doesn't have a right to the shares themselves.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n##Discretionary or accumulation trusts\r\n\r\nThese are where the trustees can decide how to use the trust income, and sometimes the assets.\r\n\r\nTrustees can decide:\r\n\r\n- what gets paid out (income or assets)\r\n- which beneficiary to make payments to\r\n- how often payments are made\r\n- any conditions to impose on the beneficiaries\r\n\r\nDiscretionary trusts are sometimes set up to put assets aside for:\r\n\r\n- a future need, like a grandchild who may need more financial help than other beneficiaries at some point in their life\r\n- beneficiaries who aren't capable or responsible enough to deal with money themselves\r\n\r\n###Accumulation trusts\r\n\r\nThis is where the trustees can accumulate income within the trust and add it to the trust's value. They can also pay income out, as with discretionary trusts.\r\n\r\n##Mixed trusts\r\n\r\nThese are a combination of more than one type of trust. The different parts of the trust are treated according to the tax rules that apply to each part.\r\n\r\n##Settlor-interested trusts\r\n\r\nThese are where the settlor benefits from the trust. They're 1 of the following types of trust:\r\n\r\n- interest in possession trusts\r\n- accumulation trusts\r\n- discretionary trusts\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nDave can no longer work due to illness. He sets up a discretionary trust to make sure he has money in the future and puts some of his money in it.\r\n\r\nHe's the settlor, but he may also benefit from the trust because the trustees can make payments to him. \r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n##Non-resident trusts\r\n\r\nThis is a trust set up or managed by someone living abroad.

If this happens you need to include it on your own tax return or tell HMRC by calling 0845 604 6455. \r\n\r\n##Accumulation or discretionary trusts\r\n\r\nWith these trusts all income is treated as though it has already been taxed at 50%.\r\n\r\nYou may be able to claim tax back on trust income you've received if any of the following apply:\r\n\r\n- you're a non-taxpayer\r\n- you pay tax at the basic rate of 20%\r\n- you pay tax at the higher rate of 40%\r\n\r\nYou can [reclaim the tax paid](http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?record=pf-A5D0R72E&formid=818 \"reclaim the tax paid\"){:rel=\"external\"} using form R40 on the HMRC website. If you complete a tax return, you can claim via Self Assessment.\r\n\r\n##Settlor-interested trusts\r\n\r\nThis is where the person who set up the trust (the settlor) still benefits from it. Income is taxed at 50% but tax can't be claimed back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*[HMRC]:HM Revenue & Customs\r\n\r\n","slug":"beneficiaries-paying-and-reclaiming-tax-on-trusts","title":"Beneficiaries - paying and reclaiming tax on trusts"}},{"table":{"body":"If you're a trustee your responsibilities depend on the [type of trust](types-of-trust \"type of trust\") you look after.\r\n\r\nIn a bare trust you won't have many duties to perform because the beneficiaries will decide how to use the assets and income and pay the tax.\r\n\r\nThe person who set up the trust might have given instructions for you in a document called the 'trust deed' - you're legally bound by this.\r\n\r\n##If there's more than one trustee\r\n\r\nNormally one person will be the 'principal acting trustee' - this person deals with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). \r\n\r\nIf you're the principal acting trustee, your actions are treated as the actions of all the trustees.\r\n\r\nAll the trustees are responsible for tax - so if the principal acting trustee doesn't pay, HMRC can recover tax and any interest from any trustee.\r\n\r\n##Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax\r\n\r\nIf you're a trustee and haven't received a Trust and Estate Tax Return you need to tell HMRC when:\r\n\r\n- a new trust that will receive income or make chargeable capital gains has been set up\r\n- a trust that hasn't been receiving income or making chargeable capital gains starts to do so\r\n\r\nTell HMRC about a new trust using form 41G.\r\n\r\n$D\r\n\r\n[Download 'Form 41G - trust details' (PDF, 380KB)](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cnr/41g_trust.pdf \"Download 'Form 41G - trust details' (PDF, 380KB)\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\n$D\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTell HMRC about changes to trusts using the number below:\r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\n**HMRC Trusts and Estates**\r\n\r\n0845 604 6455\r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\n^The time limit for notification is within 6 months of the end of the tax year.^\r\n\r\n###How to pay\r\n\r\nYou pay via the Trust and Estate tax return - there's [guidance on the HMRC website.](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/trusts/tax-return/completing.htm \"guidance on the HMRC website\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\n##Inheritance Tax\r\n\r\nYou need to let HMRC know when:\r\n\r\n- there's a 10-year anniversary\r\n- assets are transferred out\r\n\r\nUse [form IHT100](http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?record=zF43y9JIaMo&formid=3337 \"form IHT100\"){:rel=\"external\"} on the HMRC website to do this  and to pay any Inheritance Tax.\r\n\r\n##Supplying information to beneficiaries\r\n\r\nIt's your responsibility to provide the beneficiaries with a statement showing the trust income - use form R185 on the HMRC website to do this.\r\n\r\n$D\r\n\r\n[Download 'Form R185 - statement of trust income' (PDF, 221KB)](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pdfs/r185_ti.pdf \"Download 'Form R185 - statement of trust income' (PDF, 221KB)\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\n$D\r\n\r\n*[HMRC]:HM Revenue & Customs","slug":"trustees-tax-responsibilities","title":"Trustees - tax responsibilities"}},{"table":{"body":"Trusts can be complicated, but there are various people who can help you sort them out. \r\n\r\n##Tax queries\r\n\r\nHM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) Trusts and Estates can help you with [Income Tax](/income-tax \"Income Tax\") and [Capital Gains Tax](/capital-gains-tax \"Capital Gains Tax\") queries about: \r\n\r\n- trust and estate income\r\n- trusts that are part of someone's estate (property and possessions) when they die\r\n- completing the trust section of your personal tax return\r\n- explaining your Income Tax and Capital Gains tax responsibilities \r\n- telling you which forms to complete and where to get help sheets\r\n- completing the Trust and Estate Tax Return\r\n- Capital Gains Tax calculations\r\n\r\nYou can contact them at the number below.\r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\n**HMRC Trusts and Estates** \r\n\r\n0845 604 6455\r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\nIf you have a query about [Inheritance Tax](/inheritance-tax \"Inheritance Tax\") and trusts, HMRC's Probate and Inheritance Tax Helpline can:\r\n\r\n- help you understand your Inheritance Tax responsibilities\r\n- explain the Inheritance Tax procedures for trusts\r\n- tell you which forms you need and help you complete them\r\n\r\nYou can contact them at the number below.\r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\n**Probate and Inheritance Tax Helpline**\r\n\r\n0845 302 0900\r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\n##If you need more help\r\n\r\nA solicitor or tax advisor will be able to help you.
