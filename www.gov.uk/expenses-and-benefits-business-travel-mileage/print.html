  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer, you have certain tax, National Insurance (<abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr>) and reporting obligations if you cover the costs of your employees using their own vehicles for business travel.</p>

<p>There are 2 separate schemes used to deal with these mileage expenses – one for tax and one for <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr>.</p>


</article><article id="rules-for-tax"><header><h1>Part 2: Rules for tax</h1>
  </header><p>You won’t have to deduct and pay tax on any payments to employees, but you might have to report them depending on how much they are.</p>

<h2>Mileage Allowance Payments</h2>

<p>Mileage Allowance Payments (<abbr title="Mileage Allowance Payments">MAPs</abbr>) are what you pay your employee for using their own vehicle for business journeys. </p>

<p>You’re allowed to pay your employee a certain amount of <abbr title="Mileage Allowance Payments">MAPs</abbr> each year without having to report them to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). This is called an ‘approved amount’.</p>

<h2>Work out the value</h2>

<p>To calculate the ‘approved amount’, multiply your employee’s business travel miles for the year by the rate per mile for their vehicle.</p>

<h3>Tax: rates per business mile</h3>

<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Your employee travels 12,000 business miles in their car – the approved amount for the year would be £5,000 (10,000 x 45 pence plus 2,000 x 25 pence).</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>It doesn’t matter whether your employee uses more than 1 vehicle in a year (eg they get a new car halfway through the year) - it’s all calculated together.</p>

<p>You won’t have to report to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or pay tax, but:</p>

<ul>
<li>your employee will be able to get tax relief (called Mileage Allowance Relief, or <abbr title="Mileage Allowance Relief">MAR</abbr>) on the unused balance of the approved amount</li>
  <li>you can make separate optional reports to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> of any such unused balances under a scheme called the Mileage Allowance Relief Optional Reporting Scheme (<abbr title="Mileage Allowance Relief Optional Reporting Scheme">MARORS</abbr>) - contact your <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> office to join the scheme</li>
</ul></article><article id="rules-for-national-insurance"><header><h1>Part 3: Rules for National Insurance</h1>
  </header><p>You might have to deduct and pay National Insurance on payments relating to relevant motoring expenditure (<abbr title="relevant motoring expenditure">RME</abbr>), which includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>MAPs (described on the <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-business-travel-mileage/rules-for-tax" title="rules for tax">rules for tax</a> page)</li>
  <li>payments that would be MAPs, but are paid to a person other than your employee, for your employee’s benefit</li>
  <li>any other cash payments you make to your employee towards the use of their vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p>A certain amount of <abbr title="relevant motoring expenditure">RME</abbr> will be exempt from reporting to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) or paying National Insurance (NI) on. This is called the ‘qualifying amount’. </p>

<h2>Work out the value</h2>

<p>To calculate out the ‘qualifying amount’, multiply your employee’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/nimmanual/nim05831.htm" title="business miles">business miles</a> in the earning period by the rate per mile, shown in the table below.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Your employee drives 1000 miles in their van, and you make a payment of <abbr title="relevant motoring expenditure">RME</abbr> to cover this. The qualifying amount for the earnings period would be £450 (1,000 x 45p).</p>
</div>

<h2>What to report and pay</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="relevant motoring expenditure">RME</abbr> you provide to your employee in the earnings period exceeds the qualifying amount:</p>

<ul>
<li>add the excess to their other earnings for that earnings period when calculating Class 1 NI (but not Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) tax) through payroll</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <abbr title="relevant motoring expenditure">RME</abbr> is below the qualifying amount, you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>nothing to report</li>
  <li>no National Insurance to pay</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s no Mileage Allowance Relief for National Insurance, and you can’t carry forward the difference between <abbr title="relevant motoring expenditure">RME</abbr> and the qualifying amount to a later earnings period.</p>

</article><article id="passenger-payments"><header><h1>Part 4: Passenger payments</h1>
  </header><p>If your employee carries another employee in their own car or van on a business journey, you can pay them passenger payments of up to 5p per mile tax-free. </p>

<p>You won’t have to report this to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) or deduct and pay National Insurance on them either.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s no equivalent to Mileage Allowance Relief (<abbr title="Mileage Allowance Relief">MAR</abbr>) for passenger payments.</p>
