</article><article id="when-you-need-vehicle-approval"><header><h1>Part 2: When you need vehicle approval</h1>
  </header><p>Most motor vehicles and trailers used on the road need vehicle approval. Normally, the manufacturer or importer will take care of this.</p>

<p>However, your vehicle might not have approval, and you might need to apply for it. Examples of when this might happen include if you’ve:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/vehicle-registration/kit-cars-and-rebuilds" title="Kit cars and rebuilds">built or rebuilt</a> a vehicle</li>
  <li>
<a href="/vehicle-registration/radically-altered-vehicles" title="Radically altered vehicles">radically altered</a> a vehicle</li>
  <li><a href="/vehicle-registration/reconstructed-classic-vehicles" title="Reconstructed classic vehicles">reconstructed a classic vehicle</a></li>
  <li>
<a href="/importing-vehicles-into-the-uk/mutual-recognition" title="Importing your vehicle">imported</a> a vehicle</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exemptions</h2>

<p>You don’t need vehicle approval for:</p>

<ul>
<li>cars and light goods vehicles over 10 years old</li>
  <li>heavy goods vehicles over 25 years old</li>
  <li>tracked vehicles, eg a vehicle that runs on tracks rather than wheels</li>
  <li>vehicles designed and constructed for use on construction sites, quarries, ports and airports</li>
  <li>vehicles designed and constructed for and used by the armed services, fire and rescue forces, or used in maintaining public order</li>
</ul>
<p>If your vehicle needs approval, you must send proof of this in when you apply to <a href="/vehicle-registration" title="Register your vehicle">register it</a>. If you don’t, the <abbr title="Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Authority">DVLA</abbr> won’t register your vehicle.</p>


</article><article id="individual-vehicle-approval"><header><h1>Part 3: Individual Vehicle Approval</h1>
  </header><h2>Who can use the scheme?</h2>

<p>You can use the Individual Vehicle Approval (<abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>) scheme if you’re making or importing a single vehicle or a very small number of vehicles in the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>passenger cars</li>
  <li>light goods vehicles (up to 3,500kg)</li>
  <li>buses and coaches</li>
  <li>medium to heavy goods vehicles (more than 3,500kg)</li>
  <li>trailers</li>
  <li>special purpose vehicles, eg vehicles specially designed to hold a wheelchair</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can’t use the Statutory <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> scheme if your vehicle has been registered before in the UK - you’ll need to use <a href="voluntary-approval" title="Voluntary approval">Voluntary <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr></a> instead.</p>
</div>

<h2>Vehicle identification number</h2>

<p>Your vehicle needs a <a href="/vehicle-registration/vehicle-identification-number" title="Vehicle identification number">vehicle identification number</a> (<abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>) before having an <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> inspection. If it doesn’t have one, apply to your <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/dvla/contactus/localoffices/findnear.aspx" title="Find your local DVLA office">local <abbr title="Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Authority">DVLA</abbr> office.</a></p>

<h2>Basic and normal <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There are 2 levels of <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> inspection: basic and normal.</p>

<h3>Basic <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Basic <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> involves a visual inspection and other tests to make sure the vehicle meets the necessary standards. You won’t normally need to provide any documentary evidence.</p>

<p>You can apply if you have a passenger car or light goods vehicle in one of these categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>left-hand drive vehicles</li>
  <li>personal imports</li>
  <li>amateur built vehicles (kit cars)</li>
  <li>rebuilt vehicles</li>
  <li>very low volume production vehicles</li>
  <li>ambulances</li>
  <li>motor caravans</li>
  <li>hearses</li>
  <li>armoured passenger vehicles</li>
  <li>a vehicle manufactured using parts of a registered vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p>For help understanding these categories, download <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s guide on the <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> scheme.</p>

</div>

<h3>Normal <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you don’t meet the criteria for basic <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>, you’ll have to apply for normal <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>.</p>

<p>This involves a more detailed inspection. Vehicles have to meet extra standards and you’ll have to provide documentary evidence of this.</p>

<h2>How to show your vehicle meets <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> standards</h2>

<p>There are several ways to prove your vehicle meets <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> standards. For full details, see part 5 of <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s guide to <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>. </p>

<h2>Model reports</h2>

<p>One way of proving your vehicle is compliant is by showing it’s the same specification as another vehicle (a ‘master vehicle’) that’s been proved compliant. You do this using a model report. </p>

<p>If a model report has already been produced for your exact model of vehicle, you may be able to use it for a fee. <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has a list of <a rel="external" href="http://www.vosa.gov.uk/vosacorp/publications/modelreports/modelreports.htm" title="Download list of model reports and their owners: VOSA">model reports and their owners.</a></p>

<p>Otherwise, you’ll need to pay for your own tests to be carried out. These must be done by an authorised provider of ‘designated technical services’. </p>

<p>For more information on model reports, see part 11 of <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s guide on the <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> scheme.</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<h3>Choosing a test station</h3>

<p>Your vehicle will be inspected by <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> at one of their approved test stations or Privately Owned Test Facilities (POTFs). You should say which one you want to use on your application form.</p>

<h2>Cost of the scheme</h2>

<p>You have to <a href="inspection-fees" title="Inspection fees">pay a fee</a> for the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) to inspect your vehicle.</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p>Wherever possible, <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> will inspect your vehicle at the test location you’ve chosen and issue an Individual Approval Certificate (<abbr title="Individual Approval Certificate">IAC</abbr>) if it passes. You’ll need to use this certificate when you register your vehicle.</p>

<h2>Appeal against a refusal</h2>

<p>If your vehicle doesn’t pass its inspection and you’re not satisfied with the decision, you can appeal and have a re-examination carried out by an independent inspector. </p>

<p>You must make your appeal within 14 days of the decision and you’ll have to pay a fee. This will be refunded, either partially or fully, if your appeal is successful.</p>

<p>You mustn’t modify the vehicle before the appeal inspection. </p>

<p>You can appeal by downloading and filling in the <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> notice of appeal.</p>

  </header><h2>When you must use the scheme</h2>

<p>To register your motorcycle, 3-wheeled or light 4-wheeled vehicle, it must:</p>

<ul>
<li>comply with <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vca//vehicletype/ecwvta-framework-directive.asp" title="Information about ECWVTA">European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval (<abbr title="European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval">ECWVTA</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>have a Certificate of Conformity (<abbr title="Certificate of Conformity">CoC</abbr>) to prove this</li>
</ul>
<p>If it doesn’t have a Certificate of Conformity, it must be inspected under the Motorcycle Single Vehicle Approval (<abbr title="Motorcycle Single Vehicle Approval">MSVA</abbr>) scheme. </p>

<p>You must also use the <abbr title="Motorcycle Single Vehicle Approval">MSVA</abbr> scheme if your vehicle has been radically altered or built using a mixture of parts from previously registered vehicles. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>amateur built vehicles</li>
  <li>rebuilt vehicles</li>
  <li>vehicles converted to a different wheelplan</li>
</ul>
<h2>Eligibility for <abbr title="Motorcycle Single Vehicle Approval">MSVA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You can use the <abbr title="Motorcycle Single Vehicle Approval">MSVA</abbr> scheme for vehicles that:</p>

<ul>
<li>are under 10 years old</li>
  <li>haven’t been registered before in the UK</li>
  <li>don’t have <abbr title="European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval">ECWVTA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following types of vehicle are eligible:</p>

<ul>
<li>2-wheeled mopeds</li>

<h2>Partial <abbr title="Motorcycle Single Vehicle Approval">MSVA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you have a Certificate of Conformity (<abbr title="Certificate of Conformity">CoC</abbr>), it will say which side of the road and which speedometer units your vehicle is equipped for. </p>

<p>If your vehicle isn’t equipped for use in Great Britain, you must modify it. It will then need a Partial <abbr title="Motorcycle Single Vehicle Approval">MSVA</abbr> to check the following items:</p>

<ul>
<li>headlamp dipped beam pattern - this checks the headlamp is suitable for driving on the left</li>
  <li>speedometer - the speed must be shown in miles per hour (mph) or dual mph and kilometres per hour</li>
  <li>mirror location - on mopeds fitted with a single mirror, the mirror must be fitted to offside (right) of the vehicle</li>
</ul>

</article><article id="accessibility-certificate-test"><header><h1>Part 10: Accessibility Certificate Test</h1>
  </header><p>Some buses and coaches must have accessibility features for wheelchair users, like boarding lifts and ramps, wheelchair spaces and wheelchair restraints.</p>

<p>This affects buses and coaches, which:</p>

<ul>
<li>are authorised to carry more than 22 passengers</li>
  <li>carry passengers at separate fares on local or scheduled services</li>
  <li>were first used on or after 31 December 2000</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturers of buses and coaches usually apply for these Accessibility Certificates at the same time as the Certificate of Initial Fitness (<abbr title="Certificate of Initial Fitness">COIF</abbr>) when the vehicles are first built. </p>

<p>If you have a <abbr title="Certificate of Initial Fitness">COIF</abbr>, but no Accessibility Certificate from the manufacturer, you can apply for one separately. You can also apply for an Accessibility Certificate yourself if you convert a vehicle to be used as a bus or coach.</p>

<p>Accessibility Certificates last the lifetime of the vehicle as long as you don’t make any further alterations to it. Once you have an Accessibility Certificate, accessibility is then checked as part of the vehicle’s annual test.</p>

<p>To apply for an Accessibility Certificate, fill in form PSVA1.</p>

<h2>Fees for the Accessibility Certificate test</h2>

<p>You’ll need to check both wheelchair accessibility and general accessibility. Each of these sets of regulations is called a schedule.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Test type</th>
      <th>Fee</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1 schedule</td>
      <td>£51</td>
    </tr>

<td>2 schedules</td>
      <td>£104</td>

<td>Retest for 2 schedules</td>
      <td>£36</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Duplicate certificate</td>
      <td>£13</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Type approval</h2>

<p>Alternatively, vehicle manufacturers can apply for type approval, which means an Accessibility Certificate isn’t needed.</p>

<p>To apply for type approval, download <a rel="external" href="http://www.vosa.gov.uk/vosa/forms/busandcoachoperatorcertificationforms/busandcoachoperatorcertificationforms.htm" title="form PSVA6">form PSVA6</a> from the VOSA website.</p>

<p>When an operator gets a vehicle that’s been type approved they’ll get a Declaration of Conformity from the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Operators then need to send this to VOSA to get a Certification of Conformity.</p>
