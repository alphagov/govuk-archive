</article><article id="when-you-need-vehicle-approval"><header><h1>Part 2: When you need vehicle approval</h1>
  </header><p>Most motor vehicles and trailers used on the road need vehicle approval. Normally, the manufacturer or importer will take care of this.</p>

<p>However, your vehicle might not have approval, and you might need to apply for it. Examples of when this might happen include if you’ve:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/vehicle-registration/kit-cars-and-rebuilds" title="Kit cars and rebuilds">built or rebuilt</a> a vehicle</li>
  <li>
<a href="/vehicle-registration/radically-altered-vehicles" title="Radically altered vehicles">radically altered</a> a vehicle</li>
  <li><a href="/vehicle-registration/reconstructed-classic-vehicles" title="Reconstructed classic vehicles">reconstructed a classic vehicle</a></li>
  <li>
<a href="/importing-vehicles-into-the-uk/mutual-recognition" title="Importing your vehicle">imported</a> a vehicle</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exemptions</h2>

<p>You don’t need vehicle approval for:</p>

<ul>
<li>cars and light goods vehicles over 10 years old</li>
  <li>heavy goods vehicles over 25 years old</li>
  <li>tracked vehicles, eg a vehicle that runs on tracks rather than wheels</li>
  <li>vehicles made specifically for use on construction sites, quarries, ports and airports</li>
  <li>vehicles made for and used by the armed services, fire and rescue forces, or used in maintaining public order</li>
  <li>trailers with an unladen weight under 1,020kg (except semi-trailers and converter dollies) </li>
</ul>
<p>If your vehicle needs approval, you must send proof of this in when you apply to <a href="/vehicle-registration" title="Register your vehicle">register it</a>. If you don’t, the <abbr title="Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Authority">DVLA</abbr> won’t register your vehicle.</p>


</article><article id="individual-vehicle-approval"><header><h1>Part 3: Individual Vehicle Approval</h1>
  </header><h2>Who can use the scheme?</h2>

<p>You can use the Individual Vehicle Approval (<abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>) scheme if you’re making or importing a single vehicle or a very small number of vehicles in the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>passenger cars</li>
  <li>light goods vehicles (up to 3,500kg)</li>
  <li>buses and coaches</li>
  <li>medium to heavy goods vehicles (more than 3,500kg)</li>
  <li>trailers</li>
  <li>special purpose vehicles, eg vehicles specially designed to hold a wheelchair</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can’t use the standard <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> scheme if your vehicle has been registered before in the UK - you’ll need to use the <a href="voluntary-approval" title="Voluntary approval">voluntary version</a> instead.</p>
</div>

<h2>Vehicle identification number</h2>

<p>Your vehicle needs a <a href="/vehicle-registration/vehicle-identification-number" title="Vehicle identification number">vehicle identification number</a> (<abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>) before having an <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> inspection. If it doesn’t have one, apply to your <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/dvla/contactus/localoffices/findnear.aspx" title="Find your local DVLA office">local <abbr title="Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Authority">DVLA</abbr> office.</a></p>

<h2>Basic and normal <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There are 2 levels of <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> inspection: basic and normal.</p>

<h3>Basic <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Basic <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> involves a visual inspection and other tests to make sure the vehicle meets the necessary standards. You won’t normally need to provide any documentary evidence.</p>

<p>You can apply if you have a passenger car or light goods vehicle in one of these categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>left-hand drive vehicles</li>
  <li>personal imports</li>
  <li>amateur built vehicles (kit cars)</li>
  <li>rebuilt vehicles</li>
  <li>very low volume production vehicles</li>
  <li>ambulances</li>
  <li>motor caravans</li>
  <li>hearses</li>
  <li>armoured passenger vehicles</li>
  <li>a vehicle manufactured using parts of a registered vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p>For help understanding these categories, download <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s guide on the <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> scheme.</p>

</div>

<h3>Normal <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you don’t meet the criteria for basic <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>, you’ll have to apply for normal <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>.</p>

<p>This involves a more detailed inspection. Vehicles have to meet extra standards and you’ll have to provide documentary evidence of this.</p>

<h2>How to show your vehicle meets <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> standards</h2>

<p>There are several ways to prove your vehicle meets <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> standards. For full details, see part 5 of <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s guide to <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>. </p>

<h2>Model reports</h2>

<p>One way of proving your vehicle is compliant is by showing it’s the same specification as another vehicle (a ‘master vehicle’) that’s been proved compliant. You do this using a model report. </p>

<p>If a model report has already been produced for your exact model of vehicle, you may be able to use it for a fee. <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has a list of <a rel="external" href="http://www.vosa.gov.uk/vosacorp/publications/modelreports/modelreports.htm" title="Download list of model reports and their owners: VOSA">model reports and their owners.</a></p>

<p>Otherwise, you’ll need to pay for your own laboratory tests to be carried out. </p>

<h3>Choosing a test station</h3>

<p>Your vehicle will be inspected by <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> at one of their approved test stations or Privately Owned Test Facilities (POTFs). You should say which one you want to use on your application form.</p>

<h2>Cost of the scheme</h2>

<p>You have to <a href="inspection-fees" title="Inspection fees">pay a fee</a> for the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) to inspect your vehicle.</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p>Wherever possible, <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> will inspect your vehicle at the test location you’ve chosen and issue an Individual Approval Certificate (<abbr title="Individual Approval Certificate">IAC</abbr>) if it passes. You’ll need to use this certificate when you register your vehicle.</p>

<h2>Appeal against a refusal</h2>

<p>If your vehicle doesn’t pass its inspection and you’re not satisfied with the decision, you can appeal and have a re-examination carried out by an independent inspector. </p>

<p>You must make your appeal within 14 days of the decision and you’ll have to pay a fee. This will be refunded, either partially or fully, if your appeal is successful.</p>

<p>You mustn’t modify the vehicle before the appeal inspection. </p>

<p>You can appeal by downloading and filling in the <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> notice of appeal.</p>

<ul>
<li>headlamp dipped beam pattern - this checks the headlamp is suitable for driving on the left</li>
  <li>speedometer - the speed must be shown in miles per hour (mph) or dual mph and kilometres per hour</li>
  <li>mirror location - on mopeds fitted with a single mirror, the mirror must be fitted to offside (right) of the vehicle</li>
</ul>
