{"alternative_title":"","body":"$!If you\u2019re struggling to pay your Council Tax, contact your council as soon as possible.$!\r\n\r\n[Your council](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1 \"Find your local council\"){:rel=\"external\"} may be able to spread your payments out over a longer time. Only agree to payments you can manage. You may also qualify for [Council Tax Benefit](/council-tax-benefit \"Council Tax Benefit\").\r\n\r\n##If you still don't pay\r\nIf you can\u2019t come to a payment arrangement (or if you make arrangements to pay but don\u2019t), your council can ask the Magistrates\u2019 Court for a \u2018Liability Order\u2019. This is a demand for you to pay the full amount you owe, plus costs.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to attend the court and say why you think you shouldn't have to pay. Even if you decide not to attend court, you should speak to the council or, if you prefer, your local [Citizens Advice.](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/ \"Citizens Advice\"){:rel=\"external\"} The council will try to come to a reasonable arrangement with you for payment \u2013 but they can\u2019t do that unless you contact them.\r\n\r\n##If you ignore the court order\r\nYour council can take action to get the money you owe from you.\r\n\r\n###Deductions from wages\r\nYour council can order your employer to deduct a regular amount from your wages toward your unpaid Council Tax. If this means you're struggling to pay your bills, you can ask your council if they're willing to accept smaller payments.\r\n\r\n###Deductions from benefits\r\nYour council may be able to apply to have money deducted from your benefits, like Jobseekers\u2019 Allowance, Income Support or Pension Credit.\r\n\r\n###Bailiffs\r\nYour council can send bailiffs to your home to seize property to sell. Your council must write to you 2 weeks before the bailiff\u2019s first visit saying how much you owe.\r\n\r\nYou can contact the council and the bailiffs and try to agree a payment plan. However, if the bailiffs visit you their costs could be added to your bill.\r\n\r\n###Prison\r\nIf your council has tried using bailiffs but your bill still isn't paid, they can apply to the Magistrates\u2019 Court for a warrant to send you to prison. \r\n\r\nThe court must hold an enquiry with you present. This is to find out if you can afford to pay the bill. If the court doesn't think you have a valid reason for not paying, it can send you to prison for up to 3 months.\r\n\r\nThe court may decide to postpone imprisonment on certain conditions, like you agreeing to repay the debt over time. The court can also cancel all or part of the debt. \r\n\r\n%The longer you ignore a debt problem, the worse the situation becomes.%\r\n","overview":"How your local council can help if you're struggling to pay Council Tax - and what action they can take to get any money you owe from you","slug":"council-tax-arrears","title":"Council Tax arrears","updated_at":"2012-10-02T12:12:32+00:00","type":"answer"}
