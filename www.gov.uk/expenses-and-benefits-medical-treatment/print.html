</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing medical or dental treatment or insurance to your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>What you need to report and pay depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the kind of treatment or insurance you provide</li>
  <li>whether you pay the provider directly</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or pay tax and National Insurance on certain health benefits.</p>

<h2>All medical or dental treatment and insurance</h2>

<p>This is exempt if you arrange and pay the provider directly for treatment or insurance, and your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year.</p>

<h2>Periodic medical checks or health screening</h2>

<p>Only one a year is exempt.</p>

<h2>Eye tests</h2>

<p>These are exempt if they are required by health and safety legislation for employees who use a computer monitor or other screen.</p>

<h2>Glasses or contact lenses</h2>

<p>These are exempt if you have to provide them for monitor or screen work.</p>

<h2>Medical treatment outside the UK</h2>

<p>This is exempt if your employee is working for you overseas and needs treatment. </p>

<p>You must have committed in advance to pay, unless you arrange and pay the provider directly for your employee’s treatment or insurance.</p>

<h2>Medical treatment or insurance for work only</h2>

<p>Only treatment or insurance related to injuries or diseases that result from your employee’s work is exempt.</p>
