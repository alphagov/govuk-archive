    <section role="main"><header><h1>Handing in your notice, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you want to leave your job, check your <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions" title="Employment contracts">employment contract</a> for the amount of notice you must give your employer.</p>

<p>Your employment contract will tell you: </p>

<ul>
<li>how much notice you must give</li>
  <li>how you must give notice</li>
  <li>how much you’ll be paid during your notice period</li>
  <li>what may happen if you leave to work for a competitor</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you’ve worked there for more than 1 month you must give <strong>at least</strong> 1 week’s notice.</p>
</div>

<p>Your notice period usually runs from the start of the day after you handed your notice in.</p>

</article><article id="giving-notice"><header><h1>Part 2: Giving notice</h1>
  </header><p>You can usually give notice to your employer verbally or in writing, although your contract may say it must be in writing. Even if you’re allowed to give your notice verbally, however, it’s a good idea to hand in a resignation letter.</p>

<p>If you resign in the ‘heat of the moment’ (eg during an argument) and you change your mind, you should tell your employer immediately. They can choose if they want to accept your resignation or not. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You may be in breach of your contract if you don’t give enough notice, or give notice verbally when it should be given in writing.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="payment-during-your-notice-period"><header><h1>Part 3: Payment during your notice period</h1>
  </header><p>You’re entitled to your normal pay rate during your notice period, including when you’re: </p>

<ul>
<li>off sick</li>
  <li>on holiday</li>
  <li>temporarily laid off</li>
  <li>on maternity, paternity or adoption leave</li>
  <li>available to work, even if your employer has nothing for you to do </li>
</ul>
<p>You’re not entitled to normal hourly rates during your notice period if you take part in strike action after giving notice.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you have time off for union duties, antenatal care or to look for work/arrange training during this time you may be entitled to minimum pay.</p>
</div>

<h2>Payment in lieu of notice period</h2>

<p>Once you resign, or are given notice, your employer can ask you to leave immediately. In this case they’ll probably offer you a one-off payment instead of allowing you to work out your notice period - called ‘payment in lieu’.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can only get payment in lieu of notice period if it’s in your contract, or if you agree to it.</p>
</div>

<h2>Disputes over notice pay</h2>

<p>If you can’t resolve a dispute about notice pay with your employer informally, you can follow your company’s <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute" title="grievance procedures">grievance procedures</a>.</p>

<p>If this doesn’t work, you may be able to make a complaint to an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment tribunals">employment tribunal</a> for breach of contract.</p>

</article><article id="gardening-leave"><header><h1>Part 4: Gardening leave</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer may prefer that you don’t come into work during your notice period and ask you to take  ‘gardening leave’.</p>

<p>You can also be made to work from home (or another location) during your notice period.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll still receive full pay and any contractual benefits during this time.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="restrictive-covenants"><header><h1>Part 5: Restrictive covenants</h1>
  </header><p>Your contract may include a period of time that your employer wants to stop you from working for a competitor, or having contact with customers, once you’ve left the company.</p>

<p>These are called ‘restrictive covenants’.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must check your contract for your company’s policy on restrictive covenants. If you breach it, they may be able to take you to court.</p>
</div>
