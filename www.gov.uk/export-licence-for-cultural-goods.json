If the expert objects to the permanent export of the cultural good on the grounds of national importance, the case will be referred to the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest, which will recommend whether the Department for Culture, Media and Sport should defer a decision on the licence application in order to allow a UK institution or individual to raise funds to purchase the item.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to export a cultural good temporarily, rather than permanently, you will need to specify the date of re-importation on the export licence application.\r\n\r\nIf an export licence is granted, conditions may be attached.\r\n\r\nFor more help contact:\r\n\r\n$C\r\n**Export Licensing Unit**  \r\n<elu@artscouncil.org.uk>  \r\n**Telephone:** 020 7973 5188/5228/5139/5387/5194/5241\r\n$C\r\n\r\n\r\n##Fines and penalties\r\n\r\nIf you provide false information in your application or fail to comply with any conditions attached to a licence, you may be fined and/or imprisoned for up to two years.\r\n\r\nIt is important that you read the\u00a0Arts Council's\u00a0guidance before making an application.\r\n\r\n","updated_at":"2012-10-08T09:41:25+00:00"}],["tags",[{"title":"Business","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Information about starting up and running a business in the UK, including help if you're self employed or a sole trader.","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business"},"parent":null},{"title":"Licences and licence applications","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business%2Flicences.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Applying for licences from your council for events and businesses","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business%2Flicences","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/licences"},"parent":{"title":"Business","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Information about starting up and running a business in the UK, including help if you're self employed or a sole trader.","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business"},"parent":null}}]],["related",[]]],"parts":null}
