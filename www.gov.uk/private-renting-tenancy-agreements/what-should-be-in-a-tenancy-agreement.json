Usually this means the length of the rental payment period \u2013 so if you pay rent weekly, you\u2019ll get 1 week\u2019s notice. </p>\n\n<p>The notice doesn\u2019t have to be in writing.</p>\n\n<h2>Non-excluded tenancy or licence</h2>\n<p>Your landlord can end the let at any time by serving a written \u2018notice to quit\u2019. The notice period will depend on the tenancy or agreement, but is often at least 4 weeks. </p>\n\n<h2>Break clauses</h2>\n<p>If there\u2019s a break clause in the tenancy agreement, your landlord can give you notice after this. However, your landlord doesn\u2019t have a guaranteed right to possession during the first 6 months of the tenancy.</p>\n\n<h2>If you don\u2019t leave the property</h2>\n<p>If the notice period expires and you don\u2019t leave the property, your landlord may start the process of <a href=\"/private-renting-evictions\" title=\"Private renting: evictions\">eviction</a> through the courts. </p>\n\n<p>Your landlord can\u2019t forcibly remove you without an eviction order.</p>\n\n"}}]}
