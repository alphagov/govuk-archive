<h2>Residential bursary</h2>

<p>If you’re 16 to 18 you may be able to get a bursary towards the cost of accommodation from some specialist residential colleges instead of the Residential Support Scheme. </p>

<p>Most of these colleges are ‘Specialist Residential Centres’ for subjects like agriculture, art and design or horticulture. Each has its own eligibility criteria, often including parental income.</p>

<p>To apply for help contact the college directly.</p>
