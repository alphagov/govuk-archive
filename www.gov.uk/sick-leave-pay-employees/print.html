  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Your employees may be <a href="/sick-leave-pay-employees/eligibility-and-form-ssp1" title="Eligibility">eligible</a> for Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>), which is <a href="/sick-leave-pay-employees/entitlement" title="Entitlement">£85.85 a week</a> for up to 28 weeks. </p>

<p>You can offer more if you have a company sick pay scheme (you can’t offer less). Company schemes are also called ‘contractual’ or ‘occupational’ sick pay and must be included in an employment contract. </p>

<h2>Holiday (or ‘annual leave’)</h2>

<p>Statutory <a href="/holiday-entitlement-rights" title="Holiday entitlement">annual leave</a> is accrued while the employee is off work sick (no matter how long they’re off) and can be taken during sick leave. </p>


</article><article id="entitlement"><header><h1>Part 2: Entitlement</h1>
  </header><p>The weekly rate for Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>) is £85.85 for up to 28 weeks. It is paid: </p>

<ul>
<li>for the days an employee normally works - called ‘qualifying days’ </li>
  <li>in the same way as wages - eg on the normal payday, deducting tax and National insurance </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/calculate-statutory-sick-pay" title="Calculate sick pay"><abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> calculator</a> to work out the actual amount, eg for a daily rate.</p>
</div>

<h2>When to start paying <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> is paid when the employee is sick for 4 days in a row (including non-working days). You start paying <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> from the fourth day (if they normally work that day).  </p>

<h3>Exception</h3>

<p>You don’t usually pay <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> for the first 3 qualifying days unless they’ve been off sick and getting <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> within the last 8 weeks. </p>

<h2>When to stop paying <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Usually <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> stops when the employee comes back to work or no longer <a href="/sick-leave-pay-employees/eligibility-and-form-ssp1" title="Eligibility">qualifies</a>.</p>

</article><article id="eligibility-and-form-ssp1"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility and form SSP1</h1>
  </header><p>To qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>) employees must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be your employee - eg have a <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions" title="Employment contracts">contract of employment</a>
</li>
  <li>have done some work under their contract </li>
  <li>have been sick for 4 or more days in a row (including non-working days) - known as a ‘period of incapacity for work’ </li>
  <li>earn at least £107 a week in an 8 week period </li>
  <li>give you the correct <a href="/sick-leave-pay-employees/notice-and-fit-notes" title="Notice">notice</a>
</li>
  <li>give you <a href="/sick-leave-pay-employees/notice-and-fit-notes" title="Proof">proof of their illness</a>, only after 7 days off</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>Employees don’t get <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> if they: </p>

<ul>
<li>have received the maximum amount of <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> (28 weeks)  </li>
  <li>are getting maternity, paternity or adoption pay or maternity allowance</li>
  <li>are off work for a pregnancy-related illness within 4 weeks of the baby’s due date </li>

  <li>are in custody on the 1st day of sickness </li>
  <li>are off work because of a trade dispute before the first day of sickness </li>
  <li>received Employment Support Allowance within 12 weeks of starting or returning to work for you</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/calculate-statutory-sick-pay" title="Check eligibility for sick pay"><abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> calculator</a> to check eligibility.</p>
</div>

<h2>Form SSP1</h2>

<p>If an employee isn’t eligible you must send them form SSP1 within 7 days of them going off sick. They can apply for <a href="/employment-support-allowance" title="Employment and Support Allowance">Employment and Support Allowance</a> instead.</p>

<p>If your employee thinks this is unfair, they can appeal to HM Revenue and Customs. </p>

</div>

<h2>Long-term illness</h2>

<p>If you know an employee will be off for more than 28 weeks, you can complete SSP1 in advance. This means they can apply for Employment Support Allowance without delay. </p>


</article><article id="notice-and-fit-notes"><header><h1>Part 4: Notice and fit notes</h1>
  </header><h2>Notice</h2>

<p>The employee should tell you they’re sick within your own time limit (or 7 days if you don’t have one). You don’t have to pay Statutory Sick Pay if they don’t meet these time limits. </p>

<p>You can’t insist notice is given in person or on a special form. </p>

<h2>Asking for proof</h2>

<p>After 7 days off sick you can ask the employee for a <a href="/taking-sick-leave" title="Fit notes">fit note</a> from their doctor. This used to be called a sick note. </p>

<p>You can’t withhold <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> if the employee is late sending you a fit note. </p>


</article><article id="help-with-sick-pay"><header><h1>Part 5: Help with sick pay</h1>
  </header><h2>Recover Statutory Sick Pay</h2>
