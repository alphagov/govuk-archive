<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The Domestic Programme Fund (<abbr title="Domestic Programme Fund">DPF</abbr>) provides funding to charities for small projects in the UK. The Forced Marriage Unit (<abbr title="Forced Marriage Unit">FMU</abbr>) recognises that protecting victims and ending forced marriage can only be achieved if all partners across government, non-governmental organisations and statutory agencies work collectively.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Domestic Programme Fund">DPF</abbr> promotes this joined-up approach of working by encouraging and enabling voluntary organisations to contribute even more to the wide and varied ongoing work to protect victims and end the abusive act of forced marriage. This has been demonstrated even more than ever this year with £150,000 now being made available. You can view the list of successful projects from 2012 to 2013, below.</p>

<h2 id="bidding-process">Bidding process</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Domestic Programme Fund">DPF</abbr> bidding round for 2012 to 2013 is now closed. Please check this page next year for the next <abbr title="Domestic Programme Fund">DPF</abbr> bidding round for 2013 to 2014 with details of how to apply.</p>

<h2 id="successful-projects-2012-to-13">Successful projects 2012 to 13</h2>

<h3 id="ann-craft-trust--forced-marriage-and-learning-disabilities-guidance">Ann Craft Trust – Forced Marriage and Learning Disabilities Guidance</h3>

<p>This project is an in-depth survey of local Safeguarding Children’s Boards in addition to Safeguarding Adult Boards in England and Wales to identify how many have specific protocols on dealing with forced marriage of people with learning disabilities embedded in safeguarding policies and/or training. Outcomes will support the facilitation of an enhanced role and understanding in education, health care, social care and other agencies working with children and vulnerable adults. This programme of work will also enable the mapping of services that are provided both locally and regionally.</p>

<h3 id="ava-in-association-with-animage-films-the-dancer-animated-forced-marriage-film">AVA in association with Animage Films: ‘The Dancer’ animated forced marriage film</h3>

<p>A short animated film will be developed to address this contentious issue – it will promote further discussion and raise awareness in the public domain.  The film will not only act as an information portal but also to let victims and those at risk of forced marriage to know how to find help and seek further advice. All supporting material produced can also be used extensively in schools and colleges on request, and the film will be made available to all organisations and media agencies who would like to distribute and screen it.</p>

<h3 id="eaves-housing-for-women-empowering-young-people-to-prevent-forced-marriage">Eaves Housing for Women: empowering young people to prevent forced marriage</h3>

<p>The project aims to tackle forced marriage by challenging the practice head on, through working with victims and communities to overcome the culture of acceptance or of denial.  It will provide an environment for young - 16 to 25 year old - BAME people to express their views on forced marriage, support each other and ultimately become drivers for change. The project addresses two main themes of prevention and provision in that it seeks to prevent forced marriage and develop better responses when the potential risk arises. It will not only provide young people with a voice but also gives them the confidence to use that voice in preventing forced marriages.</p>

<h3 id="jan-trust-mujboor-project-urdu--forced-against-my-will">JAN Trust: Mujboor Project (Urdu – Forced against my will)</h3>

<p>This project will look to adopt a grass roots led approach to combating forced marriages, utilising dialogue with communities, education and training of those relevant service providers as part of the way to improving the enforcement of legislation.  By working collaboratively with faith groups and religious leaders in North and West London, the project will raise awareness of forced marriage and challenge a number of the perceived misconceptions and behaviours that currently tolerate forced marriage.  This model has already demonstrated it is an effective approach in other regions and will continue to target perpetrators, victims and potential victims.  </p>

<h3 id="centre-for-family-law-and-practice-college-and-university-responses-to-forced-marriage">Centre for Family Law and Practice: college and university responses to forced marriage</h3>

<p>Following the recently published pilot study examining university responses to forced marriage and violence against women in March 2012, this project aims to widen the evidence base and now include colleges and other universities.  The long-term aim will be to develop the capacity of these institutions to offer appropriate support and referrals to students who may have been threatened by, or have experienced, forced marriage either themselves, or know of others in that position. The project also seeks to identify any emerging and promising practice in terms of on-campus support, partnership working between the third sector and statutory agencies, gaps in responses and areas for improvement.  By expanding knowledge of proper campus responses to forced marriage, the proposed research will contribute to better for students and a firmer societal response to forced marriage.</p>

<h3 id="new-vic-theatre-all-our-daughters">New Vic Theatre: ‘All Our Daughters?’</h3>

<p>The proposal has been put together in response to numerous requests from NGOs and local authorities for the ‘All Our Daughter’s?’ play and workshops.  The project aims to build on the success of the initial play and tour of the ‘All Our Daughters?’ by delivering regional training conferences for professionals, voluntary sector and community members.  Both the play and accompanying workshops will form part of a tour in schools and colleges, and communities across four regions following each conference. The DVD and work-pack for agencies will be made available to be posted online via a range of partner websites - extending the life of the project.  All of this of work will contribute towards forming a national network of partners to keep forced marriage and honour based violence on local agenda’s, and create further opportunities for communication and debate.</p>

<h3 id="southall-black-sisters-sbs--enhanced-provision-of-advice-and-support-for-victims-of-forced-marriage">Southall Black Sisters (SBS) – Enhanced provision of advice and support for victims of forced marriage</h3>

<p>The project will help with the provision of information, advice and advocacy, once victims have been placed in safe temporary accommodation.  The work will also involve assistance with applications for permanent housing, reporting and prosecution of crimes, obtaining FMPOs, obtaining divorce or annulment papers, accessing counselling, benefits, friendship networks, educational and work opportunities. SBS will also provide advice, assistance and training for other organisations across the country on how to help and support repatriated victims in their local area.</p>

<h3 id="st-phillips-centre-leicester-love-honour-and-obey-a-forced-marriage-role-play">St Phillips Centre, Leicester: ‘Love, Honour and Obey’, a forced marriage role play</h3>

<p>The project will explore forced marriages with women from Leicester, through a fictitious role play about a girl and her lead up to the forced marriage. Participants will play roles and their decisions will then go on to determine outcomes. The project will encourage discussion and debate in a safe environment on a number of related issues and consider barriers created by cultural and religious sensitivities. The learning will lead to the development of storyboards to raise awareness – to be launched at an event in April 2013, for free use by schools, community centres and faith &amp; voluntary organisations to use as a tool to raise awareness. The St Philip’s Centre has access to the key communities where this is an issue and can access the key locations and individuals where changes need to be made.</p>

<h3 id="west-of-scotland-regional-equality-council-not-in-our-name">West of Scotland Regional Equality Council: ‘Not in our Name’</h3>

<p>This project will develop the ability of young men from South Asian backgrounds who are living in Glasgow and beyond, to understand and address forced marriage in their communities.  We will support the dissemination of relevant information in a male context both as being at risk or supporting a family member who is at risk.  We will involve and enable young men to spread this information across their communities and beyond by building their knowledge and confidence through training and the production of support materials.</p>
