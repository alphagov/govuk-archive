    <title>UK government oil and gas sector strategy: call for industry's views</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its industrial strategy, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (&lt;abbr title="The DEpartment for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;) announced that there will be, initially, 10 sector strategies, of which oil and gas would be one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry’s input is essential as &lt;abbr title="The DEpartment for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (&lt;abbr title="The Department of Energy and Climate Change"&gt;DECC&lt;/abbr&gt;) develop this work in partnership with Oil &amp;amp; Gas UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sector strategies will be co-developed and implemented with industry to be durable and will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be long-term in focus: developing a vision for the sector and what needs to happen from both government and business to get there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be co-created with industry: committing both business and government to specific actions to maintain and develop long-term capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take a whole of government approach: looking across all of government to identify barriers and levers which have the biggest impacts and align these to deliver growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;engage across the totality of the sector: working with industry and identifying actions which benefit business across the whole supply chain whether they are large, medium or small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publication is expected in late March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry’s views are very much welcomed particularly through January 2013 and can be fed into either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="The DEpartment for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; – Tom Worsley – &lt;a href="Tom.Worsley@bis.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;Tom.Worsley@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; – 020 7215 6480&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="The Department of Energy and Climate Change"&gt;DECC&lt;/abbr&gt; – Audrey Banner – &lt;a href="Audrey.banner@decc.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;Audrey.banner@decc.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; – 01224 254104&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Applying student number controls to alternative providers with designated courses</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>Consultation on the process of applying student number controls to alternative providers with designated courses.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation aims to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to provide an overview of the shape and purpose of the new system for alternative providers that wish their students to be able to access student support from the Student Loans Company&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to seek responses to specific proposals on student number controls, where we are consulting on options&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to invite views, particularly from alternative providers, on aspects of how this will operate in practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The higher education white paper &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/h/11-944-higher-education-students-at-heart-of-system.pdf"&gt;Students at the heart of the system (PDF, 711 Kb) &lt;/a&gt; (June 2011) set out the government’s vision for how the higher education sector in England should become more diverse and responsive to the needs of students. A key plank of that strategy is to reduce the barriers which may artificially restrict the growth of alternative provision. Over time we wish to create a more level playing field of regulation between similar providers. As part of that process we are reforming the system of designation for student support purposes for alternative providers. We have been careful to set appropriate conditions to improve student protection while minimising bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/g/12-890-government-response-students-and-regulatory-framework-higher-education.pdf"&gt;Government response to the higher education white paper and associated technical consultation (PDF, 375 Kb) &lt;/a&gt;, published June 2012, stated that we would consult on the process of applying student number controls to alternative providers who have courses designated for student support purposes. This is part of a review of the existing course designation system for alternative providers, including introducing more robust and transparent requirements on quality assurance, financial sustainability and management and governance. An overview of our plans for the new course designation system is contained in chapter 1, with chapter 2 focusing on the student number control aspect of the new system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Street Trading and Pedlary Laws: A joint consultation on draft regulations to repeal the Pedlars Acts (UK wide) and make changes to the street trading legislation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The UK Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Scottish Government are jointly consulting on proposals to ensure compliance with the requirements of the European Services Directive.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="background-to-consultation"&gt;Background to consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in our &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/s/11-542-street-trading-pedlar-laws-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government Response&lt;/a&gt; to the street trading and pedlary consultation, the Governments interpretation of compliance with the Directive developed in the course of the evaluation of the Directive amongst Member States. The consensus now is that the retail sale of goods is generally a service activity within the scope of the Directive and since pedlars and street traders are engaged in the retail sale of goods it has been concluded that changes are required to both of these regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="purpose-of-consultation"&gt;Purpose of consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the consultation is to ensure that the street trading and pedlary regimes comply fully with the requirements of the Services Directive.   The UK Government and the Northern Ireland Executive are seeking views from stakeholders in relation to the repeal of the Pedlars Acts and changes to their respective street trading regimes. The Scottish Government is only seeking views in relation to the repeal of the Pedlars Acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="areas-for-consultation"&gt;Areas for consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public views are being sought specifically in the following areas: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeal of the UK wide Pedlars Acts 1871 and 1881.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new, clear and up to date definition of what behaviour constitutes acting as a pedlar for the purposes of the pedlar exemption under the street trading regimes of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changes to Schedule 4 to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 to ensure compliance with the Services Directive - (the street trading regime of England and Wales).  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changes to the Northern Ireland (Street Trading) Act 2001 to ensure compliance with the Services Directive.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Call for evidence on the government's review of the balance of competences between the United Kingdom and the European Union</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>This call for evidence is to help inform the government's review of the balance of competences between the EU and the UK.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/images/logos/balance-of-competencies.JPG?w=200&amp;amp;h=50&amp;amp;as=1" alt="Review of the Balance of Competences"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government is carrying out a review of the balance of competences between the EU and the UK. This is an audit of what the EU does and how it affects the UK. You can read more about it on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/european-union/balance-of-competences-review/"&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s web page on the balance of competences review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have published our first &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/europe/docs/g/12-1278-government-review-balance-competences-united-kingdom-european-union-call.pdf"&gt;Call for Evidence on the Internal Market: Synoptic Review (PDF, 735 Kb) &lt;/a&gt;. The Synoptic report will cover the overall application and effect of the EU Internal Market. The result of the report will be a comprehensive , thorough and detailed analysis of the wider functioning of the Internal Market. It will determine how the so-called “Four Freedoms” operate together to create an efficient and operating Internal Market and ultimately what this means for the UK. We will subsequently be reviewing each of the “Four Freedoms” in turn in semesters 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone wishing to contribute to the review is asked to send their written views before 28 February 2013 to &lt;a href="mailto:balanceofcompetences@bis.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;balanceofcompetences@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; or online at &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/internalmarket"&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/internalmarket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our intention to publish evidence at the end of the review when the reports are published. In the meantime, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills plans to use section 22 to exempt FOI requests around evidence received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Civil enforcement remedies - consultation on extending the range of remedies available to public enforcers of consumer law</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The consultation sets out proposals to extend the range of remedies available to enforcers of consumer law.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposals would allow remedies aimed at achieving one or more of three outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased business compliance with the law;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improved redress for consumers affected by the breach; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more confident consumers who are empowered to exercise greater consumer choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation considers whether implementation of the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008 or introducing new remedies under Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002 would be most appropriate. Part 8 currently allows for court-based Enforcement Orders which can be used to stop a business behaving in a particular way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals in this consultation form part of a proposed wider reform of consumer law, intended to simplify and clarify consumer law to reduce business compliance costs and empower consumers. Implementation of the proposals would require primary legislation, which we propose to do via a proposed Consumer Bill of Rights.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Employee Ownership and Share Buy Backs - Consultation on implementation of Nuttall Review recommendations</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The Nuttall Review on Employee Ownership recommended (Recommendation V) that the Government should review and consult on changes to deregulate the conditions under which companies can: authorise share buy backs; finance share buy backs; and hold shares ‘in treasury’.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on deregulatory changes to the conditions under which companies can authorise and finance the repurchase of its own shares, and hold these shares once repurchased. The regulation of share buy backs is governed by the Companies Act 2006. Changes to these regulations, such as those proposed in this consultation would require changes via secondary legislation. The draft regulations attached below indicate how the government would implement these changes. Through this consultation we would also like to understand the implications for companies, employees, and other shareholders. In particular we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consultation on implementing employee owner status</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The Government is creating a new employment status: “employee owner”.  This will give businesses greater choice about the contracts they can offer to individuals, whilst ensuring appropriate levels of protection are maintained.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this new status, employee owners will receive shares between £2,000 and £50,000 which will be exempt from capital gains tax. Employee owners will have the same rights as current employees excluding unfair dismissal (except where this is automatically unfair or relates to anti-discrimination law), certain rights to request flexible working and training, and statutory redundancy pay. Individuals will also need to give longer notice to return from maternity leave or adoption leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on how the government will implement the employee owner status in practical terms. Through this consultation we would also like to understand the implications for employers, individuals, and the labour market in general. In particular we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shaping a UK agri-tech strategy: call for evidence</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>This call for evidence invites you to submit views and information that will help shape a Government strategy to promote UK economic growth and international development by making best use of the science and technologies relevant to agriculture.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK has the potential to be at the forefront of developing innovative solutions, and to make fuller use of its agri-science base. Translating fundamental and applied scientific research into innovative technologies, practices and information could enable countries worldwide to meet the food and environmental challenges ahead while also contributing significantly to UK economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its world class plant, animal and environmental research base, the UK is well placed to contribute to the global effort needed to improve the sustainable intensification of agriculture both at home and overseas. This would raise yields without using more land while adapting to climate change, reducing emissions, and maintaining biodiversity and other ecosystem services. It will involve engaging a very wide range of disciplines including natural (plant, animal, agronomy) and social scientists, engineers, and experts in risk management, economics and modelling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is developing a long-term agri-tech strategy focused on knowledge transfer and the application of technology to the agricultural sector. This is part of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/speeches/vince-cable-industrial-strategy-september-2012"&gt;UK Industrial Strategy&lt;/a&gt; announced by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills in September 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This call for evidence seeks to establish a strong evidence base from the existing knowledge in the agricultural sector. It will inform our understanding of role of agricultural technology, its strengths and weaknesses and the potential benefits to global food production. We aim to gain better understanding of potential opportunities for UK businesses including growth in exports of products, technology and know-how, and inward investment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Energy intensive industries compensation scheme</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>Consultation on a proposal setting out eligibility and design for a scheme to compensate key electricity-intensive business to help offset the indirect cost of the Carbon Price Floor and the EU Emissions Trading System, subject to state aid guidelines.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2011/Nov/as-2011"&gt;Autumn Statement&lt;/a&gt; on 29 November 2011 the Chancellor announced that the government intends to implement measures to reduce the impact of policy on the costs of electricity for the most electricity-intensive industries, beginning in 2013 and worth around £250 million over the Spending Review period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this the government has committed to compensate key electricity-intensive businesses to help offset the indirect cost of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/consult_carbon_price_support.htm"&gt;Carbon Price Floor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/index_en.htm"&gt;EU Emissions Trading System&lt;/a&gt;, subject to state aid guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government has now published a proposal setting out the eligibility and design of the scheme. We are now consulting on these proposals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will close on 21 December 2012, to allow time for any interested party to comment. We will also hold a stakeholder event during the consultation, on 23 October 2012, to discuss the proposal in detail. In addition, we are happy to meet separately anyone interested in the compensation package. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please email &lt;a href="mailto:energyintensiveindustries@bis.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;energyintensiveindustries@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions about the energy intensive industry package or you would like to attend the discussion event in October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consultation on implementing Directive 2011/7/EU on Combating Late Payment in Commercial Transactions</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>This consultation seeks views on the UK’s implementation of the Late Payment Directive. The Directive covers all debts incurred in commercial transactions. It applies to businesses and public authorities, whether the transactions are within the UK or effected across EU borders.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 20 September 2012 Business and Enterprise Minister Michael Fallon published a consultation on implementing new European Union (EU) legislation to combat the problem of late payment by commercial businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK was one of the first countries to introduce late payment legislation and is already seen as an exemplar across Europe. This consultation is on the recast Directive which will to extend existing laws and practices currently enjoyed by British businesses across the Union, creating a level playing field for UK businesses trading with other businesses and public authorities in all Member States. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main points outlined in the EU Directive are that: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public authorities will be required to pay suppliers within 30 calendar days of receipt of an undisputed invoice (this matches the UK Government’s standard practice for the public sector)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For business to business payments, the period for payment fixed in the contract should not exceed 60 days, unless otherwise expressly agreed and provided such terms are not grossly unfair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It copies current UK practice of a default payment period of 30 days, where terms have not been agreed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a minimum €40 (approximately £31) for compensation (current UK legislation sets three levels of compensation payment according to the value of the payment). Suppliers will not be prevented from seeking to claim additional recovery costs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is already working alongside industry bodies in the UK to encourage more businesses to sign up to the Prompt Payment Code which encourages good practice. Over 1,100 businesses have already signed up to the Code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 19 October 2012. Transposition of the EU late payment directive is due to take place on 16 March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Employment Tribunal Rules - review by Mr Justice Underhill</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>In November 2011, Mr Justice Underhill, former President of the Employment Appeal Tribunal was invited by Government to lead a fundamental review of the rules of procedure for employment tribunals. He was asked to ensure that the rules were simplified and provided the framework to manage cases flexibly, effectively, proportionately and consistently, providing certainty to all parties who participate in the employment tribunal process.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Justice Underhill’s review was published on 11th July. Government is now launching a 10 week public consultation on the substance of his recommendations. They include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a number of new rules to ensure effective case management, such as simplified and streamlined procedures for preliminary hearings and withdrawing cases;  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;new Presidential guidance which will provide all parties a better idea of what to expect and what will be expected of them at tribunal;  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a stand alone rule that gives employment tribunals and judges a clear mandate to encourage and facilitate the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution at all appropriate stages of the tribunal process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government is also taking this opportunity to invite evidence and views on wider issues related to the employment tribunal system, such as encouraging better compliance with employment tribunal orders for awards.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>The consultation seeks views on ways to support the use of settlement agreements and changes to the compensatory award limit in unfair dismissal cases.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the Employment Law Review, the Government has been looking at ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the British labour market.  The review is looking at all aspects of employment-related law and all stages of the employment life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part of the review, the Government is considering employment relationships that are not working out and what the State can do to support the parties to make informed decisions and give more certainty about outcomes when the parties separate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation covers two issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ways to encourage the use of settlement agreements as a means of coming to a consensual agreement, allowing both parties to avoid the costs and stresses of a tribunal case;  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changing the limit of the compensatory award in unfair dismissal cases to give employers more certainty about their potential liability and give employees more understanding of the value of unfair dismissal claims.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some businesses add a charge to the price of goods or services when the consumer chooses to pay by a particular method, for example by using a credit card or a debit card.  These additional charges are known as payment surcharges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation sets out the Government’s proposal for early implementation of a provision of the European Union’s Consumer Rights Directive. This will put in place legislation to ban businesses from imposing excessive payment surcharges on consumers.  Businesses will remain able to add a charge only so far as it covers the actual costs of processing any particular form of payment. The consultation is seeking views on the timing of the implementation of this legislation and how best to define the scope and application of the provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responses to the consultation will inform our guidance to businesses on how to set their fees in compliance with the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation in the UK of the remaining provisions of the Consumer Rights Directive is subject to a separate consultation which can be found at: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consultation on the implementation of the Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/EU</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>This consultation seeks views on the UK’s implementation of the Consumer Rights Directive (CRD). The provisions in the CRD will apply, subject to some limited exceptions, to all contracts for sales of goods and services by traders to consumers, whether the transactions are within the UK or effected across EU borders. The consultation document, and response form should you wish to use it, are below.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that Article 19 of the CRD, on payment surcharges, will be the subject of a separate consultation, and is not covered within this consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="implementing-the-consumer-rights-directive"&gt;Implementing the Consumer Rights Directive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Rights Directive (CRD) was agreed by all Member States of the European Union in October 2011.  Despite its name, the CRD does not aim to be all encompassing with regard to consumer rights. Rather, its aim is to simplify and harmonise rules in a limited number of key areas, to encourage growth and raise consumer confidence in buying across borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CRD’s focus is on: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring transparency of information, in particular with regard to pre-contractual information for distance and off-premises contracts (but also for other goods and services contracts) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensuring there is express consent from the consumer for any additional payments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cancellation rights for distance and off-premises contracts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prohibiting excessive fees for paying the trader - the subject of a separate consultation to effect early implementation of this provision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prohibiting excessive phone charges for consumers contacting traders about existing contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also updates legislation to clarify the cancellation rights and obligations of buyers and sellers of digital products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harmonisation aims of this Directive mean that the majority of provisions must be implemented as described, and Member States do not have flexibility with regard to their application to sectors within the scope of the Directive. The proposals in this consultation highlight those areas where we do have flexibility, and where we would very much welcome your views. In addition, the consultation seeks your views on whether there are provisions within the CRD which may be ambiguous and where business and consumers would benefit from additional clarity and on the financial impacts, both costs and benefits,that the changes in the CRD will bring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Midata 2012 review and consultation</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The consultation seeks views and opinions on a proposal to create an order making power, which if utilised, would compel suppliers of services and goods to provide to their customers, upon request, historic transaction and consumption data in an open standard machine readable format.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposals have the following aims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help people find the goods and services most suited to their needs or preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stimulate the development of a new market in personal data handling and analysis that allows UK business to target a strong potential growth market &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation received around 400 written responses from a mix of individuals, large and small businesses, industry and consumer representatives. In addition about 60 people attended dedicated open meetings organised by BIS during the consultation period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the light of the consultation the Government has announced that it will look to legislate if companies fail to comply with the voluntary release of consumers’ electronic data. To facilitate this, the Government will take a power to provide for the introduction of regulations to give consumers the right to request their transaction information in an electronic machine readable format. The power will focus on certain “core” markets, namely, energy, mobile phones, current accounts and credit cards, with the option to act more widely subject to taking into account certain factors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s  is still committed to making progress through the voluntary programme (a number of respondents indicated this would be there preference) and accordingly work on this under the Chair Professor Nigel Shadbolt will be stepped up.  In particular, the midata work on the necessary conditions for consumer trust and stimulating innovative developments will be prioritised, along with the release of new data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Government does consider making regulations under the power there will be a further round of detailed consultation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s response to the midata review and consultation is below and non confidential responses will be made accessible shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consultation on enhancing consumer confidence by clarifying consumer law</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The consultation seeks views on options to simplify and clarify the law in relation to the supply of goods, services and digital content supplied under a contract. To respond quickly and easily there is a short online version of the consultation which can be accessed via the right hand panel. The full consultation document is below.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note: the full consultation document and response form is available below, but &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/consumer-bill-of-rights/"&gt;to respond quickly and easily there is a short online version of the consultation that you can access here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers who understand their rights can play a strong part in driving growth because they force businesses to innovate and pursue efficiency. For this they need both competitive markets and a strong framework of consumer law that can be effectively enforced.There is widespread agreement that current consumer law is not fit for purpose because rights and obligations are unclear.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals in this consultation are intended to create a simple and modern framework of consumer law written in plain language that consumers and businesses can confidently use for themselves.They form part of a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues/consumer-rights"&gt;package of measures to simplify consumer law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals have two aims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To increase growth, by reducing the burden on business of over-complex and unclear law and increasing consumer confidence   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To promote fairness, by enabling consumers to understand and assert their rights when they buy substandard goods, services or digital content&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core reforms considered in this consultation are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goods: establish clear rules where uncertainty about rights and remedies is causing disputes, including a defined period for the short term right to reject within which consumers can get a full refund for faulty goods  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Services: bring the services regime more in line with goods by introducing a statutory guarantee and statutory remedies which a service provider would have to offer when the service was inadequate  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digital content: establish clear protection for digital content such as music, software and games, where the law is currently uncertain, through a separate digital content regime with its own tailored set of rights and associated remedies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Call for evidence on raising awareness of employee ownership</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>Views were sought on the measures recommended in the Nuttall Review to raise awareness of employee ownership.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Views were sought on the measures recommended in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-law/docs/s/12-933-sharing-success-nuttall-review-employee-ownership.pdf"&gt;Nuttall Review (PDF, 1.1 Mb) &lt;/a&gt; to raise awareness of employee ownership. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respones were required by 7 September 2012. Evidence collected during this process will be considered as a part of developing the formal government response to the Nuttall Review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-law/docs/s/12-933-sharing-success-nuttall-review-employee-ownership.pdf"&gt;Nuttall Review of employee ownership (PDF, 1.1 Mb) &lt;/a&gt; identified a lack of awareness as the ‘fundamental’ barrier to increasing the uptake of employee ownership in the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on several recommendations to build wider awareness and to promote the concept of employee ownership, the Review makes three recommendations around the idea of a right to request employee ownership: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="recommendation-k"&gt;Recommendation K&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(page 44) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, working with ACAS, should encourage employer and employee groups (including trades unions) to develop a voluntary Code of Practice setting out best practice on requesting and agreeing employee ownership in a company. In parallel the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills should consider what further role Government has in providing statutory support, through Recommendations L and M. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="recommendation-l"&gt;Recommendation L&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(page 44) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills should issue a call for evidence on the introduction of a statutory Right to Request consideration of an employee ownership proposal, covering the issues and challenges covered in Table 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="recommendation-m"&gt;Recommendation M&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(page 45) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills should issue a call for evidence on the best means to encourage owners and employers to make information available to employees, if a change of control of a company or sale of the business in which employees work is envisaged, in order to allow employees to consider an employee buy out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="improving-information-exchange-between-employees-and-their-employers-and-a-statutory-right-to-request-employee-ownership"&gt;Improving information exchange between employees and their employers and a statutory Right to Request employee ownership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuttall Review recommends that Government considers statutory and non-statutory options for a ‘Right to Request’ employee ownership. It sets out a number of key questions aimed at guiding the Government’s response to the Review. This call for evidence seeks perspectives on those questions, including views on the name ‘Right to Request’, to inform the development of the Government’s response in autumn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-is-a-statutory-approach-best-to-encourage-discussion-between-employees-and-their-employers-or-are-there-other-mechanisms"&gt;A. Is a statutory approach best to encourage discussion between employees and their employers, or are there other mechanisms?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuttall Review sets out the importance of encouraging discussion and information exchange between employees and their employers as well as the proposal to consider a ‘Right to Request’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What evidence is there of companies ignoring requests from employees to consider employee ownership? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would a statutory ‘Right’ embolden more employees to make requests they wouldn’t otherwise? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would improved guidance facilitate more discussion? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What information and guidance would support employers make decisions on employee ownership for their company? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="b-who-can-receive-a-request-and-what-should-the-request-cover"&gt;B. Who can receive a request and what should the request cover?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuttall Review recommends that any Right to Request employee ownership should be focused on private companies alongside the Right to Provide in the public sector, and employees should be left a broad scope as to what they can request. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should a Right to Request be distinguished from the Right to Provide for public service mutuals? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How could groups of employees develop an employee ownership proposal to put to their employers? What would be the most effective way of organising this process? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To what extent do employees already have opportunity to put employee ownership proposals to their employers? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should the request be limited to those that give all employees an opportunity to participate? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="c-what-is-the-employer-required-to-do"&gt;C. What is the employer required to do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuttall Review concludes that a statutory Right to Request could provide a greater ‘nudge’ to ensure that employee ownership is more often discussed in business contexts. It also recommends that regulatory burdens to employers are minimised, and that any statutory duty on employers should be limited to showing reasonable consideration of the Request. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What might constitute ‘reasonable consideration’ on behalf of an employer? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should there be a different approach depending on the size of company and should companies below a particular size be exempt? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the most effective means for employers and employees to discuss and share information on employee ownership solutions for the company they work in? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the pitfalls that could make this a confrontational process and how can that be avoided? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="d-what-would-be-the-grounds-for-turning-down-a-request"&gt;D. What would be the grounds for turning down a request?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuttall Review states that the grounds for turning down a request should be drawn broadly to avoid unnecessary burdens on business, and that simply stating the reason for turning down a request should be sufficient for compliance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would a prescribed list of eligible reasons to turn down a request provide employers more certainty into how they could comply? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How would Government avoid a Right to Request becoming something that is paid lip service to and no more? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="e-who-should-be-eligible-to-make-a-request"&gt;E. Who should be eligible to make a request?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuttall Review recommends a minimum requirement for a) the proportion of employees in a company and b) the length of time they serve before a Request can be made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What minimum requirements would ensure frivolous requests are minimised and that they have broad support amongst the staff? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are there measures Government or others can take to avoid unproductive and unhelpful discussions, including examples from other contexts? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="f-how-should-a-right-to-request-be-introduced"&gt;F. How should a Right to Request be introduced?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuttall Review recommends that the Government considers how the introduction of the Right to Request is phased to ensure effective implementation, for example limiting it by company size, or making it applicable to specific stages of the business lifecycle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What resources would companies need to comply with a Right to Request? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would making the Right to Request applicable only at specific points in the business lifecycle (for example, when change of ownership is envisaged), (a) make it more meaningful and reduce compliance costs and (b) provide sufficient opportunities to encourage discussion of employee ownership in a company? &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Directors' Pay: Revised Remuneration Reporting Regulations</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>This consultation seeks your views on the draft regulations for the content of directors' remuneration reports.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="directors-pay-consultation-on-revised-remuneration-reporting-regulations"&gt;Directors’ pay: consultation on revised remuneration reporting regulations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 20 June 2012, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills announced a package of measures to address failings in the corporate governance framework for directors’ remuneration. This included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving shareholders more power through binding votes, so they can hold companies to account. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boosting transparency so that what people are paid is clear and easily understood. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with responsible business and investors to promote good practice and ensure reforms have a lasting impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking forward the commitment to greater transparency, this consultation now seeks views on the draft regulations which will determine the content of directors’ remuneration reports. These regulations will revoke and replace Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/410). The draft regulations specify that the directors’ remuneration report is to contain two distinct parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A policy report&lt;/strong&gt; setting out all elements of a company’s remuneration policy and key factors that were taking into account in setting the policy. This part of the report will only be required to be produced when there is a shareholder vote on the policy. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;An annual report&lt;/strong&gt; on how the policy was implemented in the past financial year, setting out actual payments to directors and details on the link between company performance and pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this consultation is to seek evidence on the impact, costs and benefits of the proposals as well as detailed views on whether the draft regulations will achieve the Government’s policy objectives. The deadline for responses is Wednesday 26th September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation is relevant to: companies and business organisations, executive and non-executive directors, shareholders and institutional investors, employees and employee representative organisations, academics, governance experts, lawyers and other advisors.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Collective Redundancies: Consultation on changes to the rules</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The consultation seeks views on reforms to improve the quality of consultation over large scale redundancies.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has reviewed the current rules on collective redundancy consultation as part of the wider review of employment law. In response to the call for evidence conducted in late 2011, the government proposed changes to the collective redundancy regime in a 12 week consultation which concluded on 19 September 2012. The consultation sought views on a package of changes which aim to encourage better quality consultation in large-scale redundancies.  Respondents to the consultation felt that a strong case had been made for a combination of legislative change and new guidance in this area. In light of this, the government response sets out its decisions in respect of the rules on collective redundancy consultation, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 90 day period: the government will remove the 90-day minimum period and replace it with a 45-day minimum period for redundancies of 100 or more. We will, however, review the operation and impact of the shorter statutory period on the labour market once we have had time to see its full effect. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New non-statutory guidance: the government has asked the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) to prepare new guidance on collective redundancy consultations. This will address the principles and behaviours behind a good quality consultation, with a particular focus on dealing effectively with the most contentious issues, such as providing guidance on ‘establishment’. As collective redundancies happen in a variety of circumstances, which can be unpredictable and change rapidly, the code will give guidelines but allow enough flexibility for parties to tailor the consultation process appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fixed-term contracts (FTCs): the government will legislate to exclude FTCs which have reached their agreed termination point from collective redundancy consultation obligations, in line with the exemption allowed for in the Fixed-term Workers Directive.  However, a fixed-term contract will need to have a clear termination point in order for it to benefit from this exemption. Further, the exemption will not apply where the employer is considering early termination of the contract as a result of redundancy. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government intends that the amended legislation and accompanying Acas guidance will be in place for a common commencement date of 6 April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
