    <title>Press Release: Geraint Jones appointed as reviewer for the Office For Fair Access</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, announced today that he is appointing Geraint Jones as the statutory reviewer for OFFA. Should a university or college object to a provisional decision by the Director of Fair Access, the reviewer can be asked to assess the case impartially. He may recommend that there are grounds for the Director to reconsider his decision.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geraint Jones QC was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge before going to the Bar in 1976. He took silk in 2001 and is now recognised as a leading commercial and Chancery practitioner with extensive experience of judicial review work. He has an undoubted reputation for fearless independence and impartiality in upholding the rule of law. He sits as a Recorder and as a part-time Judge of the Tax Tribunal. He is also an arbitrator at the International Court of Arbitration for Sport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted that Geraint Jones will be the reviewer for OFFA, his skills and experience, if called upon, will be of great value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The position of statutory reviewer for OFFA has been in place since OFFA was established in 2004. So far there has been no need to call upon the services of the statutory reviewer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the ‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB), published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Press Release: Commenting on the latest UCAS 2013 cycle applicant figures</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesperson said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is too early to form a definitive picture about university applications for the 2013/14 academic year. Traditionally fewer than 50 per cent of applicants have submitted their applications by this point in the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students will not pay upfront, there will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments than they do now once they are in well paid jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Ten institutions on track to become universities</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will lead to the single biggest creation of universities since 1992. It follows the Government’s announcement in June that red tape barring some smaller institutions from being awarded the title of ‘university’ would be removed. Previously, institutions needed a minimum of 4,000 students to become a university. This has now been reduced to 1,000.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The applicants being put forward to the Privy Council for formal approval are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Arts University College at Bournemouth &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bishop Grosseteste University College Lincoln &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Harper Adams University College&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leeds Trinity University College &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Newman University College, Birmingham &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Norwich University College of the Arts &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Royal Agricultural College &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;University College Birmingham &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;University College Falmouth &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;University College Plymouth St. Mark &amp;amp; St. John &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These well-known and highly-regarded university colleges represent over 1,200 years of history between them. It is right to remove the barriers preventing high-quality higher education providers like these calling themselves universities simply because of their size.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that they have taken up the opportunity offered by our reforms. This will lead to the biggest creation of universities since 1992 and will enable more people to realise their aspiration of going to a university.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Westwood, Chief Executive of GuildHE, the organisation that represents the 10 institutions, said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The minister’s recommendation that ten institutions have met the criteria to become universities recognises the quality, diversity and tradition that they bring to UK higher education.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Smaller and specialist institutions are long established - in most cases for longer than many UK universities - and often lead the league tables in areas such as teaching and employability. They also have a strong reputation and impact in their localities and sectors - contributing to economic growth and to stronger, more vibrant communities. Gaining university title is long overdue and it helps to provide greater choice for students and for businesses, while enhancing the quality and diversity of the UK’s higher education sector as a whole.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to advise the Privy Council to grant the institutions university title was made after careful consideration of their applications and advice from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government first proposed reducing the minimum number of students necessary to obtain university title from 4,000 to 1,000 in the 2011 higher education white paper, &lt;em&gt;Students at the heart of the system&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Notes to editors:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**1. **UNIVERSITY TITLE: CRITERIA AND PROCESS  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;Criteria  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**An organisation wishing to apply for approval to use the title “university” must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have been granted powers to award taught degrees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normally have at least 1,000 full time equivalent higher education students, of whom at least 750 are registered on degree courses (including foundation degree programmes), and the number of full time equivalent higher education students must exceed 55 percent of the total number of full time equivalent students &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be able to demonstrate that it has regard to the principles of good governance as are relevant to its sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;**Process  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**The process for obtaining UT for institutions under Privy Council oversight is as follows:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applicant applies to the Privy Council for approval of a particular title. In exercising the power to consent to a change in any name the Privy Council must have regard to the need to avoid names which are or may be confusing  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applicants need to show evidence that the title they have selected is not confusing. They will be expected to have consulted stakeholders on their proposed title. The application should enclose the results of the consultation, together with proposed amendments to the institution’s governing documents  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Privy Council Office will seek advice from BIS, who assess the institution’s suitability for UT by judging it against the criteria listed above  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BIS will in turn seek advice from HEFCE on the student numbers and governance criteria. HEFCE will advise on student numbers through analysis of Higher Education Statistics Agency data and on governance issues will refer to recent audits of the institution’s framework of internal control, focusing on governance processes, audit arrangements, strategic and financial management arrangements, risk management processes, financial forecasts and sustainability frameworks   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the SoS considers that the institution meets the criteria for UT and that the proposed name is not confusing, BIS will write to the Privy Council Office advising them to approve amendments to the institution’s governing documents relating to a name change, thereby approving the title  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An organisation will only become a university when the Privy Council or Her Majesty the Queen approves its actual title by order or by letter.”  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is underway across Government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the Government wants the economy to travel.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New website helping students pick the right university courses</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Comparison website Unistats will provide students applying to university with the information they need to help them decide what and where to study.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;27 Sep 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable has launched the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://unistats.direct.gov.uk/"&gt;Unistats website&lt;/a&gt;, which provides comparison information on over 31,000 university and college courses in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students will now be able to compare key data on what matters to them when choosing a course at university, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Student satisfaction ratings. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graduate salaries and employment. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tuition fees and financial support. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cost of accommodation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site uses the new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://unistats.direct.gov.uk/find-out-more/key-information-set#kis"&gt;Key Information Set (KIS)&lt;/a&gt;. This was compiled after consulting students about what information they found most useful when choosing courses. Each course’s data links directly to the relevant university web page which gives more detail on course content and how it will be taught. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, prospective students will also be able to tailor their search by their personal preferences, specifying what is most important for them. They will also be able to create a shortlist of their favourite courses and produce a detailed comparison page, making it easier to compare different options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from the 2012 National Students’ Survey, published today, will also be included in the site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Cable said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Applying to university is a big decision and we want to ensure that all students, whatever their background, have the key facts at their fingertips to help them make the right choice for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The introduction of the Key Information Set represents a major step forward for students, their parents, and their school and college advisers.”  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UUK conference: "A world without boundaries"</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>David Willetts sets out the future for UK higher education and what the government is doing to improve access, funding and collaboration.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s great to join you all at Keele as our hosts celebrate their 50th anniversary. Recalling the creation of universities back in the 1960s reminds us of an optimistic sector in one of its most ambitious periods. Today, even during this era of inevitable austerity, I believe that we can still be ambitious and optimistic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-place-of-he-in-the-nation"&gt;The place of HE in the nation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2012 has certainly been a big year for Higher Education, with our reforms coming into effect. I recognise that inevitably some stress and uncertainty accompanies changes on this scale. The Government appreciates the maturity of the sector and the leadership of vice chancellors in what are, for some, challenging times. In particular, I appreciate the Government’s close working relationship with UUK. We cannot always agree, but our discussions are always open and founded on mutual trust. More than that, they are based on a shared belief that our universities are a tremendous national asset which we need to sustain and to grow.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In popular consciousness, of course, 2012 will be remembered for the Olympics and Paralympics - which gave our universities some excellent opportunities to demonstrate their place in national life. I congratulate UUK for illustrating the many connections between universities and the Games. We all think especially of Usain Bolt and his fellow Jamaican sprinters thanking their Birmingham University hosts after capturing all the medals in the men’s 200 metres final. But there have also been plenty of examples of volunteering and community engagement. We can all be proud of the university research which improved the performance of our athletes and the university-designed equipment which gave them a competitive edge. Now, the University of Worcester has launched a new degree programme for those wanting to study and ultimately work in disability sport.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debt of Olympians and Paralympians to HE is just one example of a wider debt of many of us to our universities. Last week, I was at the annual British science festival, sharing the excitement around the discovery of the Higgs Boson and most recently the discovery that redundant DNA is not so redundant after all. Again, British academics and universities are at the heart of these breakthroughs. With your contributions to the intellectual life of our nation, to educating the next generation, and to innovation and research, universities are more central to our society than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="protecting-our-national-assets-cyber-security"&gt;Protecting our national assets: cyber security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HE’s growing economic importance was made plain at the recent launch of the Government’s cyber security guidance because quite simply, much of the UK’s intellectual property resides in our universities. Only this month, Oxford University confirmed that its online security had been compromised by a cyber attack - just a day after the Cambridge University network experienced disruption. The Government will work closely with universities to ensure that the UK’s higher education system has a visible and credible international reputation for protecting commercially sensitive research from the growing risks posed via cyber space. But we can go further than just protection. Although UK universities are potential victims of cyber attacks, they can also be a large part of the long term solution. GCHQ, the EPSRC and BIS recently recognised eight UK universities as centres of academic excellence in cyber security. There is real scope to translate this knowledge into commercial opportunities and export earnings, while - for graduates - there are good prospects in cyber jobs as demand increases, providing of course they develop the right skills.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I can announce the first academic research institute - receiving total investment worth £3.8 million - to improve understanding of the science behind cyber threats. This new facility, based at UCL, will draw on university expertise in both technological and behavioural disciplines. Academic teams from UCL, Imperial, Newcastle and Royal Holloway will be the first beneficiaries of research money. The institute opens for business next month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-kinds-of-impact"&gt;Other kinds of “impact”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, part of the case for well-funded universities - as suggested by the example of cyber security - is their economic benefit. But I readily acknowledge that this is not what drives many academics, for whom intellectual curiosity is the main motive. It is a noble motive, which must be respected. However, it does help when academics and universities demonstrate how their research contributes to a strong economy and a good society. We are supporting this crucial work.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can announce today that we are providing an extra £6 million for the Higher Education Innovation Funding to be shared amongst a number of universities to assist them in further driving growth, creating and supporting innovative enterprises and building strategic relationships.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Research Excellence Framework will, for the first time, recognise the highest levels of research excellence with reward for the past impact that it has achieved. I know that you are currently busy preparing impact case studies for the REF - and that you will all be aware of the breadth of “impact” that this encompasses. It is not about “commercialisation” but more widely anything which has an effect on, changes or benefits the economy, society, culture, public policy or services, health, the environment or quality of life.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The REF is an assessment of research excellence. It is not about “journal rankings” or “journal impact factors”. Whether the research output has been published in an open access journal, a traditional publication, or even if it hasn’t been published in any journal at all, this does not affect the assessment of its quality in the REF. REF panels will not make use of “journal impact factors”, rankings or lists, nor the perceived standing of the publisher, in assessing the quality of research outputs. An underpinning principle of the REF is that all types of research and all forms of research output shall be assessed on a fair and equal basis by experts in the relevant disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="open-access"&gt;Open access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, we have also announced that we are shifting to open access for publicly funded research published in these peer reviewed journals - following the excellent report from Janet Finch, the former vice chancellor of this university. Removing pay walls will have real economic and social benefits. Still, we understand that making the transition to “gold” open access has a cost - roughly one per cent of the national science and research budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I announced an extra £10 million to be allocated to our 30 most research intensive universities to assist with the costs. This is in addition to the contribution RCUK will be making to institutions to support payment of article processing charges associated with open access, through block funding grants from next April onwards. We’ll be providing more detail on this soon, and the UK Funding Councils will launch a consultation on setting a requirement that research outputs submitted to any REF should be as widely accessible as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="he-and-philanthropy"&gt;HE and philanthropy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another report, published only yesterday by HEFCE, I particularly commend to you. I took Professor Shirley Pearce’s excellent Review of Philanthropy in UK Higher Education on holiday with me, and very much enjoyed reading it - sad but true.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been substantial momentum since Eric Thomas’s excellent 2004 report. The matched funding pot has meant that many more universities and colleges have been able to attract philanthropic gifts over recent years, and voluntary giving has improved across the piece.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these financially strapped times a challenge for every institution is to diversify its income streams and develop strategies to stimulate donations- to position their institution as an attractive proposition. Both BIS and HEFCE will be giving the report’s recommendations serious attention. Shirley and her team have made many telling observations, including on donor behaviour. We will be guided on your views. We do need to remind people of the charitable status of many university activities. If the option of a charity number for a university would help, we can take it up with the Charity Commission. And it is right philanthropy is properly recognised in honours system, so do put people forward to us and the Cabinet Office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-new-fees-regime"&gt;The new fees regime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is the month when the first students will arrive at university under the new fees regime. I believe the financing changes, despite the controversy, are in the best interests of universities, students, and the nation. As the Institute of Fiscal Studies concluded over the summer, the new regime is “substantially more progressive” than the previous system - with the poorest 30 per cent of graduates set to pay back less over their lifetimes. The IFS noted that universities will receive more money to invest in education, while taxpayers will save around £2,500 per graduate. And we are proud of the extra financial support for part-time students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in constrained circumstances the reforms achieve three crucial objectives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we have saved money for the Exchequer without reducing the cash flowing to our universities. In 2011-12, the sum of teaching grant and student loan money reaching institutions was £7.2 billion. In 2012-13, it is £7.4 billion. The indicative figure for 2013-14 is £7.9 billion. That is not bad in these austere times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there is more competition and choice for the benefit of students. Under the new funding system, students still receive public funding. We have to predict and control this cost, so - like every previous government - we have to maintain student number controls. But we favour relaxing these controls for individual universities within an overall total, so that more students can go to whichever university wants to accept them. We favour maximum possible choice for students, to accommodate for example those who may want to study locally, and those who may want to choose an institution offering lower tuition charges. We are moving from a world in which each institution is allocated a fixed number of students to what is indeed a more open and competitive system.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, the AAB and core/margin policies seek to move towards those objectives, within the fiscal constraints we face. We asked HEFCE to implement them, including making the best assumptions they could about numbers. In order to set the necessary rules in a competitive system, the assumptions had to be fixed in advance.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still too early to know fully what the outcome has been, and how students are responding. It looks as if there may have been fewer pupils achieving predicted AAB grades at “A” level, but rather more getting top grades in equivalent high-class vocational qualifications, such as BTECs. The net result may be total numbers getting AAB or equivalent which are closer to 80,000 than to 85,000, which was HEFCE’s best estimate. Different institutions will have been affected differently; that is inevitable when making significant changes, which are intended to take greater account of student choice. I recognise this comes at a time when there have been other pressures too. The number of 18 year olds is falling. Demand is unusually depressed this year because more students went straight to university last year, missing out a gap year. And more may be delaying until next year when ABB kicks in. The evidence from the Labour government’s changes in 2006 is that individual institutions can face a temporary jolt when changes like this are introduced. All this creates real pressures for some institutions. But HEFCE will take this year’s outcomes into account as it implements the changes we announced for 13/14, in the shape of a move to ABB or equivalent, plus a more flexible margin policy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third objective to which the reforms contribute is the greater information becoming available to prospective students - what I consider to be the final piece in the jigsaw. The Which guide has only just gone live, and I was pleased to attend the launch. Later this month we will be launching new Key Information Set data - which will also be available on university websites and on the updated Unistats site, enabling comparisons among institutions. The key indicators and summary information for students are unquestionably a force for good, but they are certainly not perfect and we should strive to improve them. HEFCE will carry out a comprehensive review of the student information landscape starting next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-revolution-in-teaching"&gt;A revolution in teaching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add all this together and we’re looking at what amounts to a revolution in teaching - the largest cultural change in our universities for a generation. Research has been the primary focus of attention for a long time; it’s time for teaching to be in the spotlight as well. In 2010 two important reports were published - not just Lord Browne’s but also Graham Gibbs’s conclusions on how to measure teaching quality. It’s also worth remembering, as we approach the 50th anniversary of the Robbins report, that Robbins himself was preoccupied with teaching quality. I met Claus Moser earlier this year, one of Robbins’s key researchers alongside Richard Layard, and he confirmed that teaching was uppermost in their minds.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keele, of course, put heavy store by teaching from the very beginning. Indeed, the 1964 Hale report on “University Teaching Methods” found that it was, at one time, the only institution with a Research Fellow on university teaching. I am also glad to acknowledge that the NUS, whose 90th anniversary we marked last night, has long campaigned about the quality of teaching.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now universities really do need to focus on the excellence of their teaching. At the end of this new term there will be many students returning home whose parents will be asking what they got for £3000. How crowded were the seminars? What were the labs like? How many essays did you write? How much academic feedback did you get? Every university in this room needs to be confident your students will have good answers to those questions.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An environment that focuses on engaging students in their academic study means that those students are continually encouraged to apply themselves. I hope that applicants will make full use of the KIS data in figuring out which institutions can offer the most appropriate teaching environment for their individual needs - and that universities will adjust to student- and parent-power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="student-numbers"&gt;Student numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robbins, of course, is most associated with expansion of the sector, even though that was partly set in train before he reported, as Keele perfectly illustrates. Perhaps we can best view the history of our HE sector as successive waves of expansion - a progressive interpretation that I welcome. There are periods between the waves where consolidation is the order of the day - like the current one where the number of 18-year-olds is in decline - making the raw UCAS application figures somewhat misleading. However, I believe that more growth will come and universities can rise to the challenge of proving Kingsley Amis wrong in his sour prognostication that “More will mean worse”.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed various surveys show that the number of young people aspiring to go to university has increased steadily over the past 10 years. The most recent Sutton Trust survey, published in April this year, encouragingly showed that around three quarters of year 10 to 12 pupils were likely to apply to university with a similar proportion of those in year 13 actually applying. According to the Millennium cohort study, 97 per cent of mothers want their children to go to university. I’m also very encouraged by the evidence that increased fees are not putting off young people from poor backgrounds - with a recorded fall of just 0.2 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="improving-access"&gt;Improving access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the more reason to welcome Les Ebdon, who has now started work as the Director of Fair Access. OFFA has additional resources to support as well as challenge institutions. Vince Cable and I wrote to HEFCE and OFFA in May, asking them to develop a shared strategy for promoting access which maximises the impact of all spending by Government, HEFCE and institutions.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much going on now that it is right to assess what works best to widen participation and broaden access, taking into account the latest available evidence here and abroad.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government believes it is right for institutions to seek to broaden access because real meritocracy means making sure talent is spotted, not wasted. Individuals must be considered on their merits, and institutions’ procedures must be, as we say in the White Paper, “fair, transparent and evidence-based”. And we all understand the Director’s duty to protect academic freedom, including an institution’s right to decide who to admit and on what basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-providers--vat"&gt;New providers &amp;amp; VAT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the HE sector grows it needs to continue to be open to new types of provider. It always has been. Represented here today are universities that can trace their origins back to ancient foundations, mechanics institutes, Anglican teaching colleges, Colleges of Advanced Technology - all of which took a different route to university status. This year we have eased number limits and I hope as a result we will see at least 10 smaller institutions calling themselves universities for the first time - including alternative providers, so long as they are of the necessary standard.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, HMRC published a consultation on extending the VAT exemption to for-profit providers of HE. Currently, the majority of these providers cannot benefit from this exemption in the same way that not-for profit providers can. This potentially puts them at a competitive disadvantage in the market and runs counter to our vision of a more level playing field for all. I welcome this opportunity to review such treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="industrial-strategy-and-education-exports"&gt;Industrial strategy and education exports&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Vince Cable launched our industrial strategy on Tuesday, we identified education as one of the key sectors of the future. Our universities, for one, are internationally recognised. We can do more to take advantage of our position.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a great British export industry, and in a growing market - in 2000 there were just over 2 million students worldwide studying outside their own countries. Ten years later this had doubled to 4 million. By 2020 it is predicted to be around 7 million. Our education exports are already worth around £14 billion, and could rise to around £20 billion in 2020 and nearly £27 billion in 2025, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 5 per cent.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our key economic partners of the future like Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil are experiencing a surge in the number of young people. They are keen to invest in this generation through more HE at home and more opportunities abroad. That is why HE now has such an important role in our trade missions. Earlier this year, vice chancellors accompanied the PM and me to Asia. We’re going to Brazil later this month.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opportunities for UK education overseas extend significantly beyond teaching students. For example, other countries are attracted to the expertise that UK institutions can offer in governance models, professional development and curricular design; construction, management and financing. Some foreign education systems, particularly in emerging markets, have complex needs. For them, we are adopting a new approach, which we are calling “system-to-system” - facilitated and coordinated by the UK Government. Under this umbrella, the new UK Education Services will identify opportunities, then initiate and mobilise consortia to win the contracts. It could include higher education, further education and schools, as well as a range of non-education specific services. I am taking a delegation on a system-to-system education export mission to Colombia and Mexico later this year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system-to-system approach is not about replacing or duplicating the many excellent initiatives underway. But system-to-system supplements the bilateral opportunities already undertaken by many institutions and other organisations.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseas students travelling to the UK to study is just one way we can grow. Last year 400,000 overseas students came to the UK to study. But for the first time this was exceeded by the record 500,000 people who benefitted from British higher education while living abroad. I salute the trail blazers like Nottingham, Liverpool Reading, UCL and Newcastle with campuses abroad. On a recent visit to the US I was struck by the surge of activity in distance learning. We may be at a tipping point in distance learning as technology offers more efficient and more effective ways of online learning than ever before. We will be doing more work on this in BIS over the months ahead as I believe these forms of education are really going to take off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="visas-and-the-situation-at-london-met"&gt;Visas and the situation at London Met&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few sectors of our economy with the capacity to grow and generate export earnings as great as higher education. Every overseas student on average pays fees of about £10,000 a year and spends almost as much while they are here. That means 400,000 overseas students bring in almost £8 billion a year. They make a big contribution to the economies of cities like Bradford and Exeter and Manchester, as well as London.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must not allow the London Met issues to jeopardise this success story. I am grateful to the whole sector for its prompt, coordinated and effective response to the UKBA’s decision to remove London Met’s tier 4 sponsor licence. Both UUK and the NUS are playing a full role in the London Met task force that I set up within hours UKBA’s announcement. Individual universities are offering places for the mini clearing operation that goes live next Monday.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must not lose sight of the individual students who are most affected by the current situation and we must maintain confidence across the world in the fair deal for overseas students. They may face costs of moving to alternative accommodation and costs of applying for a new visa. So I can announce today that we are setting up a £2 million fund to help legitimate overseas students at London Met who face extra costs through no fault of their own as a result of transferring to another institution. This will provide certainty to London Met students at what is a stressful and unsettling time.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope no other institution will face a similar situation in future. But it makes sense for the sector to plan now for how it would manage that risk if it did arise - we need to underline the message to students and potential students and their families that the UK is a safe and welcoming destination. There are examples of protection schemes in other countries and in other sectors - the ABTA scheme is one obvious example. So I very much welcome UUK’s willingness to develop proposals for a sector-led response to discuss with all its members. I look forward to seeing the results of that work.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must go further to protect our international reputation in the short-term too. We have already used Foreign Office posts to signal that we remain open to overseas students and I have agreed with your President, Eric Thomas, that we will jointly author an article to offer to key newspapers in our target markets explaining that overseas students are welcome here, and reminding them of what a great opportunity it is to study in UK.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, countries around the world send their best and brightest here to learn. When they come, they bring with them the potential to add a rich and diverse cultural scene to many of our towns and cities. They bring a great opportunity to make our courses more international in scope and to contribute to enabling a well-rounded education for our home students. This is a globalised world, and our people should consider themselves privileged to be exposed to such talented people from all its corners. Without international students, we would not only be poorer economically - we would also be more boring, more insular, and more ignorant of the wider world.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why transparency in the immigration statistics is vital. We therefore want to publicise disaggregated figures so that the debate can be better informed. The ONS is planning improvements in its methodology so that in future it will be possible to better identify students in the emigration flows.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make clear the attitude of the government. There is no limit on the number of legitimate students from overseas studying at British universities. They have to have the language skills and the academic training to benefit from Higher Education here. It is in everyone’s interest to maintain our high standards. The vast majority of international students are here legitimately, study hard, contribute to our economy, and take nothing from us except a world-class education. Where things are working at their best, they also make us more cosmopolitan, sustain links between our communities with heritage in other parts of the world and those places, and make the higher education offer more diverse than it otherwise would be. It is crucial that we sustain and develop these advantages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coalition believes in our great higher education institutions. Whenever David Cameron is listing our great national assets, he puts our universities high on the list. We are proud of our international reputation. We are proud so many students from around the world want to come and study here. We are proud that the lives of so many British people are transformed by the opportunity to study at our great universities. And everything we know about our culture, the needs of our economy, and the aspirations of our young people tells us that our universities will have an even greater role in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>London Metropolitan University's licence revoked</title>

    <summary>David Willetts announces new taskforce to help students following the University's licence to sponsor overseas students was withdrawn.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 Aug 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 29 August 2012, the Tier 4 sponsor licence of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsarticles/2012/august/28-LMU-revoked1"&gt;London Metropolitan University (London Met) was revoked&lt;/a&gt; due to non-compliance with its sponsorship duties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision was made following a period of suspension and audits of the University’s student records by UKBA which identified a number of serious breaches of their sponsor duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London Met students with a current valid visa do not immediately face a change in their migrant status. They will receive direct information from the UK Border Agency to inform them of changes to their status.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS are convening a task force to be lead by HEFCE, which will include UUK, UKBA and the NUS, to work with London Met to support affected students and enable genuine students to find another institution at which they can continue their studies in the UK. The task force will start work immediately to protect the interests of these students.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government recognises the important contribution that international students make to the UK, and is committed to keeping our education system one of the best in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome all genuine and legitimate students, and there is no cap on the number of international students who can be accepted to study in the UK. We fully appreciate the economic benefits and wider enrichment these students bring to the UK. We want to encourage students to come and study at our world-class academic institutions.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universities Minister David Willetts announced the formation of a task force to help overseas students affected by the decision:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is important that genuine students who are affected through no fault of their own are offered prompt advice and help, including, if necessary, with finding other institutions at which to finish their studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have asked HEFCE to lead a task force, which will include UUK, UKBA and the NUS, to work with London Metropolitan University to support affected students and enable them to continue their studies in the UK. The task force will start work immediately.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that the decision affected only London Metropolitan University which had had its licence to sponsor non-EU students revoked. Britain remains a top class destination for international students, and welcomes them.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognise that there are concerns for legitimate overseas students who will be affected and London Metropolitan University has set up a Help Centre to support and advise students. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number is +44 (0) 20 7133 4141 &lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>A new scheme to send  volunteers into state schools to give inspirational talks about their careers launches today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 Jul 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new scheme to send an army of volunteers into state schools to give inspirational talks about their careers has been launched by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deputy Prime Minister was joined by an array of famous faces and people with interesting jobs who are backing the plan, including entrepreneur Karren Brady, actor Joanna Lumley, Glamour magazine editor Jo Elvin, radio presenter Margherita Taylor and head chef at The Ivy restaurant Gary Lee.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone remembers the person who inspired them to follow their chosen career, but independent schools have much stronger links with businesses than schools in the state sector. Research published today by the Education and Employers Taskforce, an independent charity, shows that 80 per cent of independent schools regularly bring external speakers into their schools to boost the career aspirations of their students. 85 per cent involve employers in giving careers advice to students, through Careers Fairs or regular careers talks. Many state schools lack the alumni links to give their students the same opportunities. The ‘Inspiring the Future’ initiative, run by the Education and Employers Taskforce, will play a key role in plugging this gap by connecting inspiring speakers with local schools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="link"&gt;Link&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>England to be best in world for university business collaboration</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>David Willetts Minister for Universities and Science sets out plans to meet the challenge of making England the best place in the world for business-university collaboration.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;26 Jun 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the review of university-business collaboration by Professor Tim Wilson, David Willetts has announced new plans to strengthen that collaboration.  This will include improvements to the regime for sandwich courses, promotion of a new framework for business and universities to work together, and ensuring a better fit between graduates and jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s plans include:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting the Council for Industry and Higher Education (CIHE) to create a National Centre for Universities and Business. The centre will focus on strengthening the strategic partnership between universities and business with a view to driving economic growth and recovery. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stimulating student demand for sandwich courses by instituting a 15 per cent cap on fees for a sandwich year. This more reasonably reflects the costs of a sandwich place year and will encourage universities to invest in and expand sandwich course provision. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extending the Graduate Talent Pool service for a further three years. This is a high-quality online resource that brings together graduates and businesses, and advertises internship vacancies, which now includes a strict quality assurance process. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with graduate employers to promote fair recruitment and the use of new more detailed records of student achievement.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/g/12-890-government-response-students-and-regulatory-framework-higher-education"&gt;Government response to ‘Students at the heart of the system’ and ‘A new regulatory framework for the HE sector’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red-tape barring some smaller specialist institutions from being awarded the title of ‘university’ will be ditched. Previously, institutions needed 4,000 students to become a university, but from today this limit will drop to 1,000 - sweeping away an arbitrary piece of regulation that was preventing excellent institutions using the title. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change will come into effect immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be a review into how existing quality assurance arrangements affect alternative providers, including further education colleges offering higher education. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HEFCE annual conference 2012</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted that HEFCE has chosen this wonderful venue for its annual conference. This great college has trained, amongst others, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Benjamin Britten, Joan Sutherland, and - rather more recently - Gareth Malone of The Choir. Today, students from more than 50 countries have passed the sternest test of musicianship in order to develop their exceptional talents here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very fortunate that our higher education system includes specialist institutions like this one. And the conservatoire is a fascinating type of educational institution, with training at its heart. It is a good example of what we mean when we talk about the diversity of our higher education system. Diversity of mission, diversity of pursuit are among our greatest strengths, and this Government will do all it can to protect both. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="challenge-facing-conservatoires"&gt;Challenge facing conservatoires&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these institutions can face threats sometimes, because distinctive features of their educational model are not well understood. We have an example of that at the moment, with proposed changes to the terms of United States federal loans for US students who are studying overseas. The new requirement is that foreign institutions must have their own degree awarding powers in order for their US students to be eligible for US Federal Aid overseas. This change affects some of our world-class institutions dedicated to the performing arts, such as Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and LAMDA, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While so-called Listed Bodies in our system do not have their own degree awarding powers, all of their students on validated courses graduate with degrees of equal standing to students taught at the awarding body itself. Indeed, I have always argued that external degrees can be a very effective way to demonstrate high-quality teaching. It means that the standard of one institution’s programme can be scrutinised by another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will therefore be writing to my good friend Martha Kanter, Under Secretary at the US Department of Education, to explain the problem posed for these distinctive institutions by the Department’s proposals. Our institutions would lose income. America loses out if some of our excellent universities and colleges become inaccessible for gifted American students. And other students miss out from the enrichment provided by their American peers. We’ll do all we can to work with the American administration to try to resolve this matter speedily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-reforms-so-far-funding-and-teaching"&gt;The reforms so far: funding and teaching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to review where we are on the Coalition’s radical reforms of HE. I am not going to be able to answer all your understandably important questions about 2013-14 and beyond, but I hope at least to give you an update on where we have got to on the key issues you face. I do recognise just how much change you are facing, and I do appreciate how you are facing it, if not quite with equanimity, then certainly with an attitude which is sober and mature. With the wise guidance of Alan Langlands and his excellent team at HEFCE, I am sure universities will emerge from this stronger than before. And that is not an empty claim: the figures bear it out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting together recurrent and capital grant for teaching and the BIS loans outlay to higher education institutions for the upfront costs of graduate contributions, total BIS investment in pure teaching in cash terms would be over £7.4 billion in 2012-13 and could rise to over £7.9 billion in 2013-14. HEFCE’s recent assessment of the financial health of institutions concluded that the sector was financially well prepared for the new funding system with the majority of the key financial indicators the best on record - the sector reporting strong surpluses, large cash balances and healthy reserve levels. These will help the sector to manage the challenges arising from the transition to the new funding arrangements - in which the Coalition has been able to cut public spending without reducing the cash getting to our universities. It has of course been achieved not by coercing students to pay up front but by expecting graduates to pay back when their earnings are over £21,000 per year. It is a fair and progressive approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these are not just financial changes. They have much deeper implications than that. Above all they bring the quality of the student academic teaching experience to centre stage. From this Autumn, students arriving at university will be asking what they are getting for the fees of up to £9,000 a year that they will be repaying when they graduate. Students are not just consumers, but they are certainly entitled to an excellent academic education for this funding. Students and their parents will be asking much more pertinent questions about the education they are getting. I understand the argument from universities that students should not be spoon fed and instead must be treated as independent learners. But that cannot be an excuse for low levels of academic engagement or feedback, or just plain inaccessibility. I already hear reports of the cultural change in our universities as the quality of the teaching experience for students comes front and centre. That is good news. I am sure you are all preparing for a level of scrutiny of the student teaching experience that you have not had before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="information-and-data-collection"&gt;Information and data collection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That scrutiny should be well informed. That is why the National Student Survey matters. NSS results help institutions to see where to focus their efforts in enhancing the quality of their students’ academic experience. But NSS cannot be the whole story, not least because some students will have limited experience of higher education against which to judge their own course. Graham Gibbs, in his excellent report Dimensions of Quality, draws out some key inputs that are strongly linked with student engagement and educational gain. His list includes class or cohort size, close contact with lecturers and effective feedback. The White Paper sets out an expectation that universities publish summary reports of their student evaluation reports on their websites. HEFCE is pursuing this proposal alongside the NUS and sector bodies. It’s also looking further at the importance of class size, and at how to provide meaningful information to students about the teaching qualifications and expertise of staff. Class size, contact hours, who does the teaching; these are key indicators on which newly empowered students will be entitled to information. I welcome the way universities are beginning to make this information available and urge you on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are transforming the key information available to prospective students. At the same time I know there are other data requirements for which the rationale is lost in the mists of time. There is nothing more frustrating than collecting data which disappears into the ether never to be used or referred to again. We are tackling that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has to be part of reforming data collection for universities. I recognise that this academic year has been particularly difficult. The changes to the Higher Education Students Early Statistics Survey (HESES) and the student record were an inevitable result of the reforms to the financing of teaching and the need to operate two parallel systems during the period of transition. The situation was far from ideal. HEFCE required institutions’ forecasts of student numbers, for example, to prepare their preliminary grant allocations. The alternative would have been HEFCE producing forecasts on behalf of institutions and then explaining their rationale to each college and university. I trust that burdens will ease in the coming years. The annual grant letter to HEFCE from Vince Cable and myself made it a priority to reduce data collection and eliminate duplication. Action is underway on that front, especially the HE Information Landscape Project that’s set to report a couple of months from now. It’s exploring improvements to the mechanisms by which changes to data specifications are managed and communicated and, through the adoption of data standards, the extent to which improved database linking can eliminate duplication during collection. The next financial statistics review, meanwhile, will look at requirements for the financial monitoring of HE providers as going concerns and at streamlining the separate HEFCE and HESA financial data collections. And the participation of universities in the well-established HESA Record Review process has recently brought about simplification of staff and estate management statistics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a great deregulatory prize to be won here, driven by informed comment from the sector itself. I know that, in some cases, you’ve persuaded HEFCE to retain certain datasets that it was prepared to dispense with, because institutions find them useful for benchmarking purposes. We can improve the format in which data is required and the notice given, and eliminate conflicts in how it is collected. Ultimately, of course, the goal is to raise the quality and accessibility of information about higher education, especially for prospective students and their families - while simultaneously reducing the data collection problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="student-power"&gt;Student power&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But information aimed at students is not worth much unless those students can act on it. That is where our shift to open access for students with AAB comes in. We originally estimated that this would benefit about 65,000 students. Our latest estimate is that actually around 85,000 places will be liberated from student number controls in 2012/13. That is a quarter of all entrants. It is a radical change that has started to liberate the system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know from my conversations with Vice Chancellors that the sector is responding well. Because, at AAB and above, institutions can accept all the applicants they wish to, more students will be studying at their first-choice institution and universities are having to work hard to attract those applicants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we have been able to increase choice through the core-and-margin policy. When I opened the new University Centre in Harlow earlier this week, I met lone parents who told me they are unable to leave Harlow to study because of family responsbilities. Now, thanks to core-and-margin, they can access higher education on their doorstep better than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our White Paper committed us to year-on-year increases in the number of liberated places. To an extent, that is likely to happen naturally - given past trends, for example, in school achievement. And I urge HEFCE to continue talking to qualification bodies about the details of the tariff policy, for example in relation to equivalent qualifications. We want to go further than this, but are still digesting strong views on whether to do so in 2013/14. I recognise that you need to know very soon exactly what our policy will be for 2013/14. We all wish to avoid last year’s scenario in which many institutions had to rewrite their access agreements so, while I am not in a position to make an announcement now, I hope to do so before the end of the month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am often asked why can’t we simply free up the whole system so that all those who want to study in higher education can find a place somewhere. That is after all how the school system works. But entry to higher education has always been competitive rather than automatic. We recognised the unprecedented level of demand for higher education in our student finance changes, which enable us to keep numbers broadly flat despite current fiscal retrenchment and falling numbers of young people. But the cost of educating each student remains significant, so those wishing to see further expansion need to think creatively about how to cover the costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="postgraduate-support"&gt;Postgraduate support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding for postgraduate provision has also attracted attention recently - and, in the HEFCE grant letter, Vince Cable and I signalled our wish for HEFCE to protect it as far as possible. This Government has long recognised the value of postgraduate education; it is a fundamental component of the higher education sector. In response, HEFCE announced additional funding in this area, which is expected to total £39 million and returns postgraduate taught funding broadly to pre-reform levels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HEFCE has rightly been praised for introducing these arrangements for an interim period. It is currently consulting on funding for 2013-14 onwards and is proposing to provide higher rates of grant for postgraduate taught provision than for undergraduate provision to minimise any reduction in income. I urge you to respond to this consultation to allow HEFCE to reflect on views from the sector. I would welcome policy ideas on how to finance post graduate study in future. Tim Leunig of Centre Forum has already put forward one interesting model. It would be great if others suggested alternative approaches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="offa-and-access-to-he"&gt;OFFA and access to HE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new fees and loans for undergraduates are essential to maintaining the financial sustainability of our universities in tough times. But we would not have been able to get support for these changes without a renewed push to ensure that universities are broadening participation and improving access. After the rather fraught debate on this, when Les Ebdon was appointed, let me make it absolutely clear that we are not introducing quotas. Your power to decide who you admit is rightly protected in legislation. And Les absolutely understands that he will be working within the framework of that legislation and the policies set out in our White Paper and the Coalition’s social mobility policy statement launched a year ago. Institutions will always have complete autonomy over whom they choose to admit. Vince Cable and I are glad that Les will be picking up the reins at OFFA. He was the strongest candidate, selected in a fair and open process - and he will provide a clear voice for the sector with the advantage of coming from the sector and understanding it. What we all want to see is not social engineering - and certainly not quotas - but quite simply genuine meritocracy. Because entry to our universities is a competitive process with more applicants than there are places we do a serious sorting exercise. This is unlike some countries, where everyone has a claim to go to their local university and then a very large number drop out over the first year as they are winnowed out. We try to do that assessment beforehand. It can be based on more than just A Level results, by looking at all the information that indicates the potential of an individual to succeed. The aim is that those who can perform best at any given university are selected for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now spend a lot of money trying to overcome the barriers which might stop those who are perhaps at weaker schools or in low participation neighbourhoods going to university. There are three main funding streams. Institutions estimate that they’ll be spending £620 million annually through their access agreements by 2015-16. This is of course universities’ own funds collected from students in the form of fees. Tomorrow, HEFCE will be publishing updated guidance on the National Scholarship Programme for 2013-14, when the public contribution will be doubling to £100 million; it will reach £150 million by 2014-15. HEFCE also has its widening participation premium, running at about £140 millon. These figures are not strictly comparable and I have been warned that it would be a vulgar error just to add them together. Nevertheless, it is clear that spending is growing here, perhaps by £100m between 2009-10 and 2012-13. This is a record, in fact. It is evidence of how much universities and the Government are committed to social mobility achieved, not by quotas, but by true equality of opportunity. That increased funding is paying for a host of initiatives. Some must work better than others. Some may be paid for by one university but improve participation at a different one. We now need a much more systematic assessment of what works and what is less effective. So Vince and I will be writing to both HEFCE and the Office for Fair Access, with a request for them to develop a shared strategy for widening access to maximise the impact of the combined investment across the entire sector. In particular, we’ve stressed the importance of all widening participation activity resting on a firm evidence base - derived both domestically and from overseas - in order to deliver improvements throughout the HE system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s vital here that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, with the minimum of duplicated effort, the commissioning of new broadly valid research, where appropriate, and integrated monitoring of performance, wherever possible. Let’s not forget that the whole point of this work and this investment is to identify and realise human potential. The social, moral and economic benefits of doing so shouldn’t need repeating here. We are asking OFFA and HEFCE to provide a substantive account of their plans in the autumn with provisional evidence and findings as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work is already underway to assemble the evidence on the effects of the emerging changes in Higher Education. With the Department for Education and Nuffield Foundation, we are funding new analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies and the Institute of Education on access and the effects of tuition fees. Using longitudinal survey data, it will include assessment of the earnings returns from different kinds of degree, to improve understanding of the influence of universities on social mobility and to estimate the future profile of student loan repayments. We are also working to improve the graduate earnings data we have already to establish a more detailed picture of variations across the sector; the Office for National Statistics, for example, have piloted a new question in the Labour Force Survey this year on institution attended. In the meantime, I encourage more university academics to follow the lead of the Institute of Education, Neil Shephard and Nick Barr, think tanks and independent organisations like the Sutton Trust in exploring HE policy options and compiling associated evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="enterprising-universities"&gt;Enterprising universities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one nowadays can ignore the economic impact of universities. This is not the whole story. What goes on in universities is fundamentally worthwhile in its own right. It is part of being a civilised society. But you can recognise that and at the same time welcome the sheer economic boost provided by our universities. And our Universities are opening up to enterprise and business as never before. Often, I speak about the value of university autonomy primarily in terms of teaching and research. But it is no accident that freedom from government interference in other activities enables you to spread your wings. When the European University Association found that English institutions have substantially more autonomy than those on the Continent, it included the ability to reach out to business and foreign markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In last month’s Budget, George Osborne announced £100 million for universities to attract co-investment in new research infrastructure. It was an important boost for the sector and reflects the Government’s understanding that universities are key economic agents with the power to encourage growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been plenty of recent examples. Earlier this month, I attended the formal opening of the new Southampton Marine and Maritime Institute, a partnership between the university and Lloyd’s Register enabling a revamp of the Boldrewood campus worth £116 million. Elsewhere, I’ve been pleased to learn that a £4 million capital investment at Loughborough University opened the door to a £60m investment from BAE systems, while at Dundee, a capital investment of £8 million attracted £23m from AstraZeneca, GSK, and others for a major new life sciences research centre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us have been excited by the competition Mayor Bloomberg ran in New York, and, in January, I announced that the Coalition is inviting proposals for a new type of university. Professor Adrian Smith followed up with inviting ideas for to see if we can attract investment for new post graduate science and technology research institutes here. This work led to the new money announced in the Budget. The new money will be granted to large capital projects across the UK which are capable of levering in significant private and/or charity investment - upwards of £200 million. This is a well-rehearsed way of stimulating innovation by increasing the funding going into economically promising research fields and advanced technologies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first grants will be allocated in the 2012-13 academic year. HEFCE, in consultation with the devolved administrations, is currently working out governance of the funding, processes and representation of both the academic and business communities. I’m hoping that, following the HEFCE Board meeting at the end of this month, we’ll be able to put out a call for expressions of interest with accompanying criteria - perhaps in Universities Week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-international-opportunities"&gt;Other international opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the international sphere, meanwhile, a whole host of other opportunities for enterprising institutions. Demand for HE is growing worldwide. UNESCO estimates there are currently 150 million HE students; there could be as many as 260 million by 2025. Many of these students want to study abroad, of course, and the UK attracts more of them than any other country except the United States. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, increasingly, emerging economies want to educate their students at home, and the UK - a global pioneer in developing educational facilities - is well placed to help. We not only have strengths in teaching and research but in design and construction of universities, mobilising finance, curriculum development, qualification accreditation and quality assurance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since becoming universities minister, I have worked hard with UUK’s excellent international office and of course the British Council in forging partnerships with other countries: with China, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and - in the past fortnight - Turkey and Indonesia. In Turkey, for instance, I witnessed the real potential for a “system-to-system” offer - with students able to study in either country, sharing of educational technologies, academic exchanges and degree validation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, I agreed a joint communique on education to develop our links with Indonesian universities - promoting two-way student mobility, institutional leadership and knowledge transfer. The likes of Nottingham University already have solid connections to Indonesian institutions. There’s room for more productive associations - in Malaysia, for example, which has more overseas British campuses than any other country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My department is working with UUK, UKTI, the British Council and others to support our excellent universities - and private companies working in the education sector - to seize these opportunities. It means attracting overseas students here. It means more overseas campuses. But it has to go further and be a full offer from the range of players that make up British higher education today - from architects and trainers of administrators through to external examiners and shared post graduate study. We are still only scratching the surface. This is one of Britain’s great growth industries of the future. The deep respect for our universities across the world is a reminder of what we have achieved here and what more we can do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>University funding confirmed for 2012-13</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Government has published its annual grant letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter sets out the priorities &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/"&gt;HEFCE&lt;/a&gt; should have regard to when distributing funding to institutions and the efficiencies the government is asking the sector to make. It covers 2012-13, the first academic year of the new higher education funding arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/L/letter-he-funding-25-jan-2012"&gt;Download the letter&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State for Business Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is important that we deliver a stable and sustainable funding environment for universities as our reforms bed in. This grant letter confirms the funding levels we signalled last year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This year also sees the introduction of the new National Scholarship Programme. This will play a critical role in ensuring our universities attract a more diverse range of students.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our universities play a vital role building the skills and knowledge Britain needs to grow. That is why we have protected HEFCE funding for research and why, despite difficult public finances, we expect the total funding available to the sector could increase by 10 per cent in cash terms as a result of our reforms.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are increasing the total funding available to the sector - with a projected rise from £9.3 billion in 2011-12 to £9.8 billion in 2013-14 - and our reforms will enable successful universities to expand if they wish to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“However it is also essential that the sector works collaboratively to lower their costs. Changes to the VAT treatment of shared services, lowering the cost of procurement and work to reduce the burden of data collection give universities the chance to prioritise more of their resources for teaching and research.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK and China embark on education partnership</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The UK and China have agreed an action plan to strengthen their relationship on education cooperation.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Willetts and John Hayes along with Michael Gove and Chinese Minister for Education Yuan Guiren took part in the 6th UK-China Education Summit in London on Thursday 27 October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the summit David Willetts and Yuan Guiren opened a higher education roundtable involving 19 UK Vice Chancellors and 12 Chinese University Presidents. The three themes for the roundtable were: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joint Programmes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research Collaboration &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Student Mobility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the day was the signing of a new UK-China Partners in Education &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/imagelibrary/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=28&amp;amp;MediaDetailsID=4618&amp;amp;SubjectId=35"&gt;action plan.&lt;/a&gt; The action plan covers four stands: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher Education: Building Partnerships and Promoting Mobility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vocational Education: Developing Vocational Education and Skills Training&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic Education: Raising School Standards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Language Cooperation: Promoting Mandarin Learning in UK and English in China&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, 13 agreements were signed between UK and Chinese institutions including Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial, Manchester and Nottingham universities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Skills John Hayes talking about the Vocational Education strand of the action plan said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is an exciting opportunity to explore new ways of collaborating between industry and education institutions. We’re looking forward to discovering possible approaches to piloting a UK apprenticeship programme in China during 2012.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The education summits and programme of work are a key part of the broader cross-government strategic relationship with China which is overseen by annual summits at Head of Government level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=421762&amp;amp;NewsAreaID=2"&gt;Read the full press notice on the summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Universities UK Annual Conference</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning - and thank you, Eric Thomas, for that introduction.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to wish you every success in your new role - and to record my thanks to your predecessor, Steve Smith, who unfailingly offered good advice while representing the interests of a diverse sector. I know David Willetts would also want to record his appreciation. UUK will certainly remain the pre-eminent voice for universities as we begin to implement the big changes to our higher education system.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognise a lot of faces in the audience, from the mission group meetings and visits, and I welcome the opportunity to speak to you today. This is a key form of engagement.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a remarkable year, not just in terms of the coalition and the economy, but &lt;br&gt;
also because this time last year, Lord Browne had yet to issue his report on HE finance. 12 months later, and preparations are well underway for a substantially different funding system. This is a fundamentally new system, and as Eric has said, and self-evidently, I appreciate that some people have had difficulties with it. It has been a difficult and sometimes traumatic process for us, but I can honestly say that I believe the alternatives would be worse. I inherited a situation in which my Department, much of whose spending is on Universities, was due for a 25% cut, and indeed we did then have a 25% cut in the Spending Review. The implications of a straight reduction in spending of that order of magnitude for your universities doesn’t bear thinking about, although I’m sure you have thought about it. Instead, we have a different model, in which money - and more of it - will follow applicants to the institution of their choice, the quid pro quo being that those institutions become more accountable to students for the undergraduate experience.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new model will, as you know, improve student choice and access, teaching and employability - as well as, from your point of view, putting the sector’s finances on a sustainable footing. If we aggregate my department’s investment in HE in various streams, it was around £9 billion in 2010-11, and we anticipate it will reach around £10 billion in 2014-15. I know you will talk about capital spending, about inflation and so on, and I do appreciate the situation is difficult but at a time of deep real cuts in spending and in people across the public sector, I hope you will agree, and Eric was generous in making this point, that this is a good outcome for your sector.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universities and colleges are already responding to those aspects of the agenda which focus on students. By 2015, the sector will be spending more than half a billion pounds annually on widening access; that’s around £200 million more each year compared to 2010. I would like to record my appreciation for the way you have responded to the new expectations from the Office of Fair Access - and I also recognise the important work that Martin Harris and Graeme Davis did in getting all the access plans discussed and agreed by July. This was a potentially difficult exercise, but it went well thanks to all those involved. The new director for Fair Access, who we expect to recruit this autumn, will have a hard act to follow.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to student recruitment for 2012-13, we will, as you will of course, all be looking very closely at how applications fare. There is some inevitable uncertainty with the introduction of the new model, but the evidence we have gives cause for optimism. Vice chancellors have been telling us about encouraging numbers of prospective applicants attending their open days. The feedback from our own information campaign suggests that large numbers of students and their parents, when the fog of propaganda is cleared and we can gauge understanding of the objective reality, now understand that nobody has to pay up-front fees; that a student loan is very different from a credit card debt; that graduates on relatively low incomes will pay less overall than they do now; that all graduates will have lower monthly repayments; and that maintenance will be more generous.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are not complacent. Young people - especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds or with no prior family experience of university - are still susceptible to misconceptions about HE and its cost. That is why we will be continuing the communications campaign through the autumn. Later this month, a team of recent graduates will start visiting schools, sixth forms and colleges across England to explain, from their own standpoint, the value of going to university. They’ll also be explaining the new fees, grants and loan arrangements - addressing questions and concerns right up to the UCAS application deadlines.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undergraduate admissions for 2012-13 will be different in another sense, of course. We have had powerful representations from the sector on the Stalinist system of student number controls, and so we are liberalising student number controls to allow universities to recruit as many applicants achieving AAB at A-level as they choose to. This will mean students having a better chance of getting a place at the university of their choice. Those with AAB are likely to go to University in any event, and this makes it a sensible point to start with our plans for liberalisation. And we’re reserving 20,000 places for universities, FE colleges and other providers able to demonstrate that they can deliver high-quality courses at less than £7,500.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these initiatives are about freeing up the current restrictions on student numbers, frankly increasing competition, and supporting diversity within the sector. I hope at the level of the basic objectives, you would share in this. We have to pursue them while retaining our overall financial control of public expenditure, which makes it difficult and means we need to proceed cautiously.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my earlier life, I worked on and worried about the removal of planning, and the process of perestroika; I am aware that there will be come concerns about unintended consequences. There have been suggestions that this will reintroduce some sort of two-tier higher education system; this is absolutely not the case - our aim is diversity, not division.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a very diverse sector at present, and UUK rightly celebrates it as such. Our changes are meant to enhance that diversity, not to divide institutions into arbitrary groupings. This applies also to the HE/FE boundary. I continue to hear worrying reports that FE colleges’ attempts to offer HE courses are being discouraged by university partners.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will of course be looking very carefully at how the changes bed in, and will ask HEFCE to do the same. HEFCE will also be keeping an eye on issues like subject balance so that we avoid inadvertently affecting the supply of strategically important subjects, like engineering. We have had a number of conversations about this; some people think there could be positive and some people think there could be negative outcomes for science subjects, for example. This suggests that we don’t know yet - but we will obviously keep a very close eye on it.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made clear that this is not a one off; we want to increase, year-on-year, the share of places that are liberated from student number controls. We want the 20,000 places for which institutions will need to compete to grow steadily in future years. We believe these policies will help successful, dynamic institutions of all kinds meet the very wide range of demand from different students. But we will keep the details under observation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HEFCE are currently consulting on the practicalities for 2012/13, and we will listen closely to any advice they give us, based on your responses. We are certainly not tied to a particular set of criteria or rules into the indefinite future. We are keen to listen and react. But nor are we going to be scared off by worries that may never come to pass, when there is a real prize here, which is greater choice for students between different types of good quality provision.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulling these threads together, we have put forward - in our response to Browne, in the White Paper, and through many discussions with UUK and other groups - a clear strategy for HE, and we believe that it’s the right one.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis will remain firmly on improving teaching; on new, innovative ways of organising undergraduate courses; on making sure that all applicants can see essential information about contact time, work experience opportunities, subsequent employability data and the like on universities’ websites. We’re intent on seeing the sector modernise and also achieve greater operational efficiency, recognising that our world class institutions have a broader mission than fitting in with our financial constraints.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we said in the White Paper, while this government has no target for the “right” size of the higher education system; we have been critical of the 50% target. While we are eager to establish parity of esteem for those who chose vocational training in preference to university, we endorse the principle of the 1963 Robbins report that “courses of higher education should be available for all those who are qualified by ability and attainment to pursue them, and who wish to do so” - subject to expenditure constraints.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, for all the short-term disruption, which I know is how some of you perceive this, I honestly believe that we can take what is internationally acknowledged as an excellent HE system to greater heights. As we reduce the bureaucratic weight on universities, as we create room for dynamic institutions to expand in line with student demand, there are real opportunities for colleges and universities to make the most of their autonomy and fulfil their respective missions.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We undertook in the White Paper to implement a very light-touch regulatory regime that puts different types of university on a level playing field, if they want their students to access public funding in the form of our much-improved support package. We’ve since elaborated on that commitment in a consultation document, and are due to introduce a Bill to Parliament in the next session, in 2012, that will put this regime into law.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are further reasons for optimism. This summer’s clearing exercise has, all in all, gone well, and I congratulate everyone involved at UCAS and elsewhere. Meanwhile, there’s been no repeat of the large-scale problems suffered in the recent past by the Student Loans Company, who have become much more focused on the needs of their customers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would acknowledge - this point is made to me when I visit Universities, and I hope you know that we’ve been putting the case - that an area of concern to the sector is visa reform. I hope you’ll agree that we’ve managed to make progress on the key issues. Bona fide students from overseas make a significant contribution to campus life and the financial security of universities and will be encouraged- and this is why no cap has been introduced on students during the recent changes to the visa system. From 2012, those graduating from a UK university will be able to switch onto a Tier 2 visa, provided they meet certain requirements. There is, in principle, no cap on the number of graduates who will be able to follow this route.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll know that the UK Border Agency announced last week its changes to the criteria for Highly Trusted Sponsor status. The HE sector has excellent standards of compliance, and we do not anticipate the new criteria being problematic. The criteria aim to achieve a sensible balance between attracting genuine students and operating a robust immigration system that denies entry to people with an ulterior motive. They recognise that some students will fail at various points in the system, so allowances have been made to cover such instances in determining refusal, enrolment and completion rates.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad that the HE sector made a significant contribution to the consultation process, and I would appreciate having your further views on how well the new system beds down, and whether any changes are needed to support your long-term sustainability.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, we have made progress on tackling the hurdles that institutions can face in bringing foreign academics over as guest lecturers and external examiners, a key and positive part of the University scene, by expanding the terms of the Tier 5 Government Authorised Exchange Scheme. We’ve also had success in raising the status of scientists and researchers, many of whom will take jobs in universities, under Tier 2. Exceptional academics can apply via the new Tier 1 Exceptional Talent route - a route that takes account of the expert views of the National Academies.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have my absolute assurance that David Willetts and I will continue to work with the UK Border Agency - and with universities - on removing obstacles to the essential business of global intellectual exchange. International students are important for a university’s basic mission and important for the economy; put crudely, HE is an export industry.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my main cause for optimism has been the activity I’ve seen for myself during visits to colleges and universities over the past year. In recent months, for example, I have visited Plymouth University’s outstanding research facilities for marine energy, and talked to students there in the process of launching their own businesses. At London Southbank University, I opened the Puri Institute for fostering enterprise among engineers - a great example of philanthropy. And I was at Edinburgh last week, for the launch of a new doctoral programme for engineers focused on offshore renewable energy. In Norwich, I visited the Research Park. I am constantly amazed and uplifted by the work I see.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also see a lot of encouraging work, often to degree standard, going on during visits to FE colleges. HE in FE is very much part of this country’s educational future. At Farnborough, the quality of training for students of aerospace engineering is first class. The same goes for courses at Birmingham Metropolitan College, who have a link with Caterpillar to provide advanced manufacturing training, and in Solihull College where they have fantastic veterinary facilities. There’s no question that many colleges have the capacity to deliver HE and to contribute to growth.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HE and FE sectors have a major role to play in both underpinning and spearheading economic growth, and it’s no accident that David Willetts is also speaking about universities and growth at another event this morning. The contribution to growth happens in many ways.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many institutions are extremely important to their local economies as well as the national economy, and I welcome the participation of many of you in the new Local Enterprise Partnerships. Of the 18 LEP boards formally recognised so far, every single one has at least one HE or FE institution on board. Some, like the South East LEP, which covers East Sussex, Kent and Essex, have three universities signed up.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to talk now about universities in respect of research. The White Paper was largely silent on the research side of the sector’s work, not because it is unimportant, but because we intend to address it separately in the forthcoming innovation and research strategy which is going on now and will give an end-product by the end of the year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research is not all and does not have to be utilitarian. It is worth acknowledging the key role of university researchers in attracting substantial foreign direct investment. While we are outstanding currently, the world is changing rapidly and we cannot be complacent. The UK’s share of global publications is falling. The challenge is to maintain the virtuous circle of excellent research, which entices the brightest people to our universities and pulls in resources from business and philanthropic institutions, so that the intellectual, medical and technological breakthroughs continue to be achieved. I would also stress that while a lot of research is undertaken in clusters, we will support excellence wherever it is found; it is not our intention to create a handful of successful institutions.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government made a decision to protect public investment in science and research, and we have allocated an additional £100 million for capital research spend in this financial year. Thanks, meanwhile, to grants from round 4 of Higher Education Innovation Funding, among other things, microbiologists at Coventry University have helped Bostik to bring a new antibacterial sealant to market. Imperial is helping Scottish Power to advance techniques for carbon capture and storage, which is also a key environmental objective for this Government. Hull is working with the likes of Philips and Siemens on remote monitoring technologies for patients with heart failure and pulmonary disease.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programmes funded by the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) provide another reliable route to collaborative R&amp;amp;D. Of the 900 projects currently funded by the TSB, more than two-thirds have at least one university partner involved. I attach particular importance to the new Technology and Innovation Centres which will accelerate the commercialisation of emerging technologies by drawing on research taking place across the country. We have one fully launched, integrating universities and business; the first centre focuses on High Value Manufacturing - and will build on national expertise in the manufacturing research centres funded through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. Two further centres have already been announced.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The duty of government is to make sure that our policies in support of innovation are coherent and efficient; that they enable useful knowledge transfer and growth across the economy, not just in high-technology sectors; that they give taxpayers the greatest bang for their buck. These are the overarching issues we’re examining in preparation of the innovation and research strategy, as I say coming forward by the end of the year - in consultation with universities, among others.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to make one final point. What’s certain is that operational efficiency is essential in every part of our innovation infrastructure, universities included.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, I very much welcome UUK’s initiative in setting up its Efficiency and Modernisation task group. I’ve discussed its work with Ian Diamond - and I’m looking forward to seeing the group’s final recommendations in a couple of weeks from now. There is a lot of scope for savings within institutions through better procurement, outsourcing, and the use of shared services. There’s also scope for much greater transparency about costs, not least so students can know how their fees are being spent - and how effectively. I hope that we get real progress in this area over the next 12 months.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more personal note, I know that many of us think about things using visual images rather than on bits of paper. I was an undergraduate many years ago - half a century. I was an academic, around 40 years ago, and I have had three children go through the system more decades ago than I care to think about. But it is important that we don’t get trapped in our prejudices, important that we engage and see how universities are reaching and justifying every day the banner of being called “world-class.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Widening participation statistics released</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New statistical release from ONS</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//analysis/statistics/higher-education/official-statistics-releases/widening-participation-in-higher-education/analysis-of-progression-rates-for-young-people-in-england-by-free-school-meal-receipt"&gt;Widening Participation in Higher Education: Analysis of progression rates for young people in England by free school meal receipt and school type&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New statistics show that a greater proportion of students receiving free school meal went on to university between 2005/06 and 2008/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap between the progression rates of those receiving and not receiving free school meals was 18 per cent in 2008/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the statistics, Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These figures show how far we have to go to ensure that young people with the ability to go onto Higher Education have the opportunity to do so. While the progress to widen participation at our universities is welcome, more progress is needed - particularly at the most selective institutions. That is why we have expected universities to put more ambitious outreach programmes in place for 2012 - and they will be reviewed annually for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our reforms ensure there are no financial barriers in the way of bright young people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds attending university. There are no upfront fees, more financial support while studying, as well as a more generous package of scholarships and fee waivers.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These statistics are being published as part of the social mobility strategy, Opening Doors, Breaking Down Barriers (April 2011), and replace the previous Full-Time Young Participation by Socio-Economic Class (FYPSEC) measure.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Next stage of the HE consultation opens</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New consultation on details of the regulatory system for the future of higher education now open.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIS has launched a consultation on details of the regulatory system for the future of higher education today, following publication of the higher education white paper.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent White Paper Higher Education: Students at the Heart of the System (June 2011) set out a commitment to introduce a new, fit-for-purpose regulatory framework to establish the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) as lead regulator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new consultation launched today is a technical consultation, and to be read alongside the White Paper. It informs what changes in procedures, powers and duties will need to be considered, particularly in forthcoming legislation, in order to protect the student interest and provide a high quality experience.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/hereform/technical-consultation/"&gt;Take part in the consultation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Access agreements for universities</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Final details of the fees universities will charge next year are released today by the Office for Fair Access.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office for Fair Access (OFFA) has today announced it has approved 2012-13 Access Agreements for 139 institutions - 123 higher education institutions and 16 further education colleges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also announced that English universities and colleges charging above £6,000 for their courses plan to boost their spending on access measures to £602 million a year by 2015-16, up from £407 million in 2011-12. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This figure rises to £738 million a year when the Government’s contribution to the National Scholarship Programme (NSP) is included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.offa.org.uk/press-releases/universities-and-colleges-to-increase-their-spending-on-access-to-600-million-a-year/"&gt;Read OFFA’s announcement in full.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Government is determined that no-one with the ambition and ability, whatever their background, should face barriers to accessing higher education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Progress over the past few years in securing fair access to the most selective universities has been inadequate. Only around 40 pupils out of the 80,000 on free school meals currently make it to Oxbridge at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The government therefore tasked OFFA with setting more demanding tests than in previous years. We are satisfied that universities and colleges are showing their determination to improve. Indeed, by 2015, we expect the sector’s investment in access to be more than £600m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will be monitoring performance on fair access closely every year to ensure we see tangible progress in opening the doors of our universities to the most disadvantaged.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universities and Science Minister David Willetts went on to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We told universities to be much more ambitious with their plans for attracting people from low income backgrounds in exchange for charging students more. This will result in a step change in social mobility with university investment in programmes such as summer schools, scholarships and fee waivers reaching more than £600 million annually by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The majority of students will not be paying £9,000. No one should be put off going to university for financial reasons. No first time undergraduate will have to pay up front costs and there is a very generous package of financial support. Graduates will make lower monthly repayments than they do now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Putting students at the heart of higher education</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Government releases a Higher Education White Paper - Students at the Heart of the System.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future, graduates will pay more towards the cost of their degrees, but - in return - the Government’s proposals will improve their experience as students, expand their choices and make universities more accountable to students than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals contained in ‘Students at the Heart of the System’ cover four broad areas: reforming funding; delivering a better student experience; enabling universities to increase social mobility; and reducing regulation and removing barriers for new providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reforms will ensure that universities are held accountable for an improved student experience. The HE White Paper published today will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure better information for students before they apply, better teaching while at university, greater transparency in areas such as feedback on their work and better preparation for the job market &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask Professor Sir Tim Wilson to undertake a review into how university-industry collaboration can excel. The review will look at how the decline in sandwich courses can be reversed. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage universities to engage actively with employers to accredit or “kitemark” courses to indicate to students that they are valued by them. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make universities more accountable to students on teaching quality, who can trigger quality reviews where there are grounds for concern. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review the extent to which Student Charters are adopted and whether they should be made mandatory in the future. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free up student number controls by making around 85,000 places contestable among universities in 2012/13: through unrestrained recruitment of high-achieving students who typically get AAB grades, and by creating a flexible margin of places to reward quality providers charging an average of £7,500 or less for tuition. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure that the Office for Fair Access is properly resourced so that it can go further and faster to drive fair access for students from lower income families and widen participation. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable a wider range of providers to join the sector to offer more choice for students. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Promise less regulation and bureaucracy for universities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White Paper comes as part of the wider government agenda to put more power in the hands of the consumer. The Government has launched a major programme for public sector modernisation by cutting waste and bringing choice, encouraging competition and opening the market up to new providers. For higher education, this means that in future funding will follow the choices of the student.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Vince Cable, said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our university sector has a strong history with some world-class institutions attracting students from across the globe. Higher Education is a successful public-private partnership; combining Government funding with institutional autonomy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This white paper builds on that record, while doing more than ever to put students in the driving seat. We want to see more investment, greater diversity, including innovative forms of delivery from further education colleges and others, and less centralised control over student numbers. But, in return, we want to the sector to be more accountable to students, as well as to the taxpayer.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universities Minister, David Willetts, said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Government will reform the financing of higher education, promote a better student experience and foster social mobility. Our overall goal is a sector that is freed to respond in new ways to the needs of students.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Responding to student demand means enabling a greater diversity of provision. This may mean more higher education going on in a wider range of different settings, such as Further Education colleges and other alternative providers offering innovative types of course.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We must move away from a world in which the number of students allocated to each university is determined in Whitehall. But universities will be under competitive pressure to provide better quality and at lower cost.”   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New student finance taskforce launched</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>David Willetts backs the new taskforce on student finance, headed by Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com and former NUS President Wes Streeting.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/loans/2011/06/martin-lewis-to-head-student-finance-taskforce-"&gt;The independent taskforce&lt;/a&gt; will work to combat the myths around the changes to English student finance in 2012 and will seek to reassure potential students about what they can expect when applying for university and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is to be independent of government and set its own agenda - membership is of university, student groups, experts and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will will provide a valuable boost to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/topstories/2011/Jun/make-your-future-happen"&gt;government’s public information campaign&lt;/a&gt; on student finance for 2012 students, launched last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin Lewis said;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For 20 years we’ve educated our youth into debt when they go to university, but never about debt. For that we should hang our heads in shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With the huge 2012 changes coming, we must ensure students understand the true cost of their education, so they can decide whether it’s worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/blog/2011/06/17/heading-up-the-new-student-finance-taskforce/"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Read Martin Lewis’ post on the launch of the Taskforce on the BIS Blog&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universities Minister David Willetts said, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I strongly back this new initiative. The group will be well resourced by the sector and we will be listening to what it says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is vital that people understand how the new system will work from 2012. This independent group has the expertise and reach to communicate to a huge number of prospective students, families and teachers as well as to universities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Under the new system no new student will be asked to pay up front for their tuition. There will be more financial support for students from low-income households. Graduates will not be asked to repay their loans until they are in well paid jobs. I thank all those who are coming together from a wide range of organisations to help ensure the public have the facts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="student-finance-information"&gt;Student Finance Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The press, radio, media partnership and social media campaign links students and parents to a new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://yourfuture.direct.gov.uk/"&gt;dedicated Direct.gov.uk microsite&lt;/a&gt;, which describes how the tuition loan system will operate, how to get a student loan, help with living costs and what support is available from government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Independent Taskforce on Student Finance Information is made up of the National Union of Students (NUS), the National Association of Student Money Advisors, UCAS and the higher education bodies Universities UK and GuildHE, as well as being supported by many others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its primary aim is to co-ordinate, advocate and champion best of breed communication, gathering together the best examples of apps, web tools, guides, speakers, literature and more, allowing all interested groups access to the best unbiased educational tools to help students understand the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government launches next phase of Growth Review</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Skills, the rural economy and medium sized businesses will be the focus as the Government concentrates on restoring the economy.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the radical programme of reforms set out in the first Plan for Growth, published at the Budget, the next stage of the review will focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure - considering how to eliminate barriers and encourage greater investment in UK infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education and skills - looking across the whole of the education system from schools, FE colleges, universities and other training providers to consider how to maximise economic growth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Logistics - covering rail, road, shipping and air freight interests and cutting across the wholesale industry, looking at opportunities and barriers to growth as the logistics sector evolves in response to the increasing complexity and globalisation of supply chains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mid-sized businesses - examining businesses that have expanded beyond the definition of SMEs, considering how to increase the number of firms that show significant growth at this level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rural economy - scrutinizing the constraints, opportunities and risks impacting on economic growth in rural areas, and considering specific issues including labour market characteristics, to support the Government’s commitment to rebalancing the economy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open data - investigating the potential growth benefits and risks of opening up access to public sector data assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are launching the second stage of the plan for growth with one central purpose - creating the right conditions for business to start up, invest, grow and create jobs.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing the evidence this week of successful rebalancing of the economy towards exports and manufacturing, with the announcement of major commitments from Nissan and BMW, and today the commitment from Rolls Royce to an expansion of their Apprenticeship programme.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-plan-for-growth"&gt;The Plan for Growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//policies/growth/the-plan-for-growth"&gt;The Plan for Growth&lt;/a&gt; set out more than 100 actions across 15 sectors and themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the three months since its publication the Government has already: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut corporation tax by 2 per cent to 26 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased the personal allowance by £1,000, taking nearly a million people out of tax altogether.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduced a moratorium on new regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/topstories/2011/May/green-investment-bank"&gt;Launched the Green Investment Bank&lt;/a&gt; with an initial capitalisation of £3billion to support green infrastructure programmes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set out plans for 21 new Enterprise Zones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boosted tax reliefs on new investments including reform of the Enterprise Investment Scheme.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doubled the lifetime limit for Entrepreneurs Relief to £10m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks the Government will: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish a new presumption in favour of sustainable development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Further expand the University Technical College programme.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pilot a land auctions model starting with public sector land.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reform the UK’s competition framework.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establish a package of measures to support town centres, building on Town Centre First.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Publish the Government response to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview.htm"&gt;Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second phase of the Growth Review will involve an intensive programme of engagement with business over the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the evidence collected, action plans for growth in each review area will be presented to a Ministerial Group chaired by the Chancellor and Business Secretary, with final plans due for report in the autumn.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“New students will not pay upfront costs, there will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments than they do under the current system once they are in well paid work.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A university degree is an excellent investment in your future. Students and their families need to know that applying for student finance is quick and easy and can be done on-line.”&lt;/p&gt;
