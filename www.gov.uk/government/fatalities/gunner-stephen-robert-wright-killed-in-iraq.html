  <figcaption>Gunner Stephen Robert Wright   
[Picture: MOD]</figcaption></figure><p>Gunner Wright, 20, from 58 (Eyre’s) Battery, 12 Regiment Royal Artillery, died as a result of injuries sustained from a roadside bomb at approximately 1300hrs local time near the town of Ad Dayr, north of Basra City. He was on a routine patrol in support of a Danish reconstruction team when the incident occurred.</p>

<p>The explosion hit his vehicle patrol as it was returning to base following a routine task training the Iraqi Police. Very sadly the incident killed two soldiers from the Battery, including Gunner Wright.</p>

<h2 id="gunner-stephen-robert-wright">Gunner Stephen Robert Wright</h2>

<p>Gunner Stephen ‘Trigger’ Wright was born on 18 May 1986 in Preston, and grew up on Belcarres Road, Leyland, Lancashire. He decided at an early age that he wanted to pursue a career in the British Army, and enlisted on 11 December 2002 as a 16 year old.</p>

<p>After completing his training ‘Trigger’ was posted to 12 Regiment Royal Artillery, joining 58 (Eyre’s) Battery Royal Artillery on 2 April 2004. The deployment to Iraq was ‘Trigger’s’ first operational tour and he had been very keen prior to deployment to ‘do his bit’, an attitude which he maintained in theatre.</p>

<p>He was serving with 58 (Eyre’s) Battery, normally based in Sennelager, Germany, as part of 12 Regiment Royal Artillery. The Battery currently forms part of the Danish-led Basra Rural North Battle Group and is four months into a six-and-a-half month tour of Iraq under the overall command of the UK’s 20th Armoured Brigade.</p>

<p>‘Trigger’ was highly regarded by his commanders and peers alike and undoubtedly had a bright future ahead of him. Indeed he had been selected to attend a promotional course on return to Germany. He was a soldier who had embraced the Army life and what it could offer him and looked forward to a long career in the Royal Artillery; where he was very much a member of ‘the family’.</p>

<p>‘Trigger’ was a well-respected member of the Battery, where he was well known for his sense of humour. He was a quiet man but could always be relied upon to shine when times were hard and you least expected it. He had an infectious smile which kept the Multiple in high spirits, both in training and on tour.</p>

<p>He was not an active sportsman and had been told on many occasions that he had two left feet. Nevertheless he loved taking part, even if that meant injuring his friends. A very social person, ‘Trigger’ was never one for sitting around and letting the world pass him by and would lead from the front at any social event. Gunner Wright was single.</p>

<p>His Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jon Campbell, from Headquarters of 12 Regiment Royal Artillery in Sennelager, Germany, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is with immense sadness that I learned of the death on operational service of Gunner ‘Trigger’ Wright, in Iraq. Gunner Wright was a valued member of the Regiment who was partway through his tour of duty doing what he wanted in life; serving with his Regiment and his team mates on operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This personable young man had already made a big impact with his Battery. When I last visited 58 (Eyre’s) Battery in July, I was struck by Gunner Wright’s confidence, growing maturity, and belief in himself. A quiet man, never one to offer unnecessary comment, he preferred to speak only when he had something of value to add.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gunner ‘Trigger’ Wright had very much come of age in Iraq where he displayed unwavering loyalty to the Battery, his multiple and his team. To lose such a valued young man under these tragic circumstances has affected all us enormously. We mourn Gunner Wright’s passing and will do all we can to support his many friends and family.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He will be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues in Germany and within the Battery serving in Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following statement was issued by the family of Gunner Stephen Wright:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stephen’s death has come as a massive shock to his family who are still grieving the death of his mother, Elaine, who died suddenly 10 months ago. Stephen has since made his home, when on leave, with his grandparents Robert and Shirley Wright, of Leyland.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stephen attended Wellfield High School. On leaving school, he had a short time in the cadets before joining the Army. He spent an enjoyable 12 months at the Army Foundation College in Harrogate before being posted to Germany and then to Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stephen was a quiet, happy, young man who enjoyed nothing more than spending time with his friends and family. A few weeks ago, he spent time at home with his grandparents on R&amp;R before returning to Iraq. He was looking forward to going back to finish his duties. Stephen loved the Army life. It was all he wanted to do. The whole family is very proud of him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Defence Secretary Des Browne added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was extremely sad to hear of the death of Gunner Wright. By all accounts he was a most valuable member of his unit and a tribute to his Regiment. My thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.</p>
