[Pictures: Iain Hamer, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]</figcaption></figure><p>The six soldiers were killed in the Lashkar Gah Durai region of an operational area on the border of Helmand and Kandahar provinces.</p>

<p>They were on a patrol to dominate the area and maintain freedom of movement when their Warrior armoured fighting vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device resulting, tragically, in the deaths of all six personnel.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond, paid the following tribute to the men:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like the rest of the nation, I was shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the incident in which these six fine members of the British Army lost their lives. Reading the tributes paid to them by their fellow servicemen, it is clear that they were held in the highest of regard.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>They were professional soldiers, doing the job they loved for the sake of their country. No-one should be in any doubt that the cause for which they sacrificed their lives is one that is vital to Britain’s national security. None of this will lessen the pain for the six families now grieving for their loved ones, and all my thoughts are with them at this very difficult time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="sergeant-nigel-coupe">Sergeant Nigel Coupe</h2>

<p>Sergeant Nigel Coupe was a Senior Non-Commissioned Officer from 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, who was attached to 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment as a Warrior Sergeant in 7 Platoon, Corunna Company.</p>

<p>Sergeant Coupe, 33, was from Lytham Saint Annes, Lancashire. He joined the Army in January 1996 and was enlisted into The Queen’s Lancashire Regiment which subsequently became 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment. </p>

<p>For a period he was attached to The Duke of Wellington’s Regiment, which later became 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment. He also completed a tour as an instructor at the Driving and Maintenance School in Bovington before deploying to Afghanistan with Corunna Company.</p>

<p>Sergeant Coupe was an integral part of both 7 Platoon and Corunna Company. His expertise was vital to ensuring the Company was fully prepared to deploy on operations. His kindness and devotion to the soldiers he led will leave an indelible mark on everyone who served with him. He will be sorely missed.</p>

<p>He leaves behind his beloved wife Natalie, and two children, Ella and Jasmine, mother Elaine, father Alan, sister Linda and grandfather Roy. The thoughts and prayers of all those in his Battalion and Combined Force Lashkar Gah are with them at this most difficult time.</p>

<p>The family of Sergeant Coupe have paid the following tribute:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nigel was a loving grandson, son, husband and daddy who doted on his two little princesses. He dedicated almost 17 years of his life to the Army and we are immensely proud of all that he achieved in his short life. He was loved by everyone and will be sorely missed. Words can’t describe the loss we feel. We request that we are left alone to grieve in peace as a family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas Wood, Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, said;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sergeant Nigel Coupe was quite simply an outstanding soldier who epitomised all that a sergeant from The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment should be.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Professional, courageous and utterly dedicated to his job, he was highly-regarded by all who worked with him. Those who had the pleasure to spend time with him whether in the back of his Warrior, in the mess, or out in the field, were touched by his humour, his kindness and his willingness to help others. Everyone who knew him wanted to be with him. He was completely selfless.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other than his family, his passion was being in the Army and being an Armoured Infantryman. He served for a number of years as a Warrior instructor and then as a vehicle commander with 3 YORKS and was excited about serving in Afghanistan in the role and conducting the job he loved.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was committed to assisting the Afghan National Security Forces with transition across Helmand and with defeating the insurgents. His loss is deeply felt within the Regiment and our heartfelt sympathy and thoughts go out to his wife and children. Sergeant Coupe will be sadly missed and he will leave a hole in all our lives that will be difficult to fill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning , Commanding Officer, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sergeant Nigel Coupe was a polite, committed member of this family battalion. Throughout his distinguished career he provided loyal and dedicated service to those he led, whether that be in Kosovo, Iraq or Afghanistan. He was proud to be a Lancashire soldier in a Yorkshire battalion.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unassuming in nature but with real presence he was fiercely dedicated to his profession as an Armoured Infantryman. This dedication and potential marked him out amongst his peers and few, if any, could match his technical prowess on Armoured Vehicles. It is no surprise that he was one of the handful to be selected to be an Instructor at our prestigious Armoured Training Centre Bovington.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today we have lost one of our brothers who led, mentored and tutored those above and below him with true humility and compassion. Our thoughts and prayers in these difficult days rest with his family Natalie, Ella and Jasmine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Ian Mortimer, Commanding Officer, Combined Force Lashkar Gah (The Queen’s Royal Hussars Battle Group), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We in Combined Force Lashkar Gah are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Sergeant Nigel Coupe. For those who knew him he was exceedingly professional, taking huge pride in everything he did, and was utterly committed to his job.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the Warrior Platoon Sergeant of 7 Platoon, he made a deep and lasting impression on the soldiers under his command, who respected him for his care and compassion. With an easy going manner, he was always there to help them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have lost an outstanding soldier, a devoted family man, and a genuinely professional soldier. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this most difficult and tragic time. We will remember him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Edward Colver, Officer Commanding, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I first met Sergeant Coupe when I was a Platoon Commander with the Duke of Wellington’s Regiment in 2001. He immediately struck me as a chirpy confident Lancashire lad with a love of armoured infantry and proud to be a Lancashire man in a Yorkshire Regiment.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was clear that he loved his job and was always keen to get his hands dirty on the vehicle park. When returning as Officer Commanding Corunna Company I was pleased to see the arrival of his familiar face and to welcome him into Corunna as a Warrior Sergeant.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He fitted straight into the Company ethos, keen, enthusiastic and determined to get the very best out of his crews and his soldiers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>His knowledge of all things Armoured Infantry, having spent time as an instructor at the Armour Centre in Bovington, was exceptional, and he added huge value to the training package designed to prepare the Company for Afghanistan. Thoroughly professional and dedicated, he demanded the best and never failed to live up to the standards he set.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sergeant Coupe went to great lengths to adapt our tactics, techniques and procedures for using Warrior Armoured Vehicles. He recognised the threat that we faced and went to great lengths to mitigate them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>His work on this front will never be forgotten. His loss leaves both the Yorkshire Regiment and Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment missing a true friend. Our condolences are with his family in these incredibly tough times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Daniel Brennan, 7 Platoon Commander, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sergeant Coupe was selfless in his commitment to both his family and friends. His kindness and uncompromising professionalism will be missed by all who had the honour of knowing him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warrant Officer Class 2 Eric Whitehouse, Company Sergeant Major, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sergeant Coupe was one of the few men around with a natural ability to get things done with the minimum of fuss. He was a man who inspired his subordinates and a man who they wanted to follow. Through his natural command ability, soldiers wanted to work for him.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>His successful career included time in the Recce Platoon and as a Driving and Maintenance Schools Instructor. He excelled in soldiering. His knowledge and experience of Warrior knew no bounds. He had an exceptional instructional ability, and having taught many of his own platoon to drive Warriors, he had trained the best of the drivers in the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was, ultimately, a friend to all and will be missed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sergeant Stewart Watts, Platoon Sergeant, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nige was a highly intelligent, family orientated man who was totally committed to his job and the soldiers he led. He was a dear friend to all who knew him and he will be sorely missed by his family, friends and colleagues. It was a pleasure and honour to have worked with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sergeant Kirk Reid, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nige, your professionalism will always be remembered, taking pride in everything you do, and putting others before yourself on every occasion. The perfect gentlemen with an amazing family that I’m sure will miss you always.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My deepest sympathy and all the love and comfort I could give go to Nat and the kids. Take care mate. You will be missed but always remembered.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>NEC ASPERA TERRENT (Difficulties be Damned).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corporal Mark Leleavuno, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sergeant Coupe was a bloke given from God and taken away by God. He always helped his platoon and mates in all aspects of life.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You were a well-respected person to work with, and may you rest in peace. May the Good Lord bring peace to your family and your two lovely kids. God Bless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lance Corporal Lee Marshall, Section Commander, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sergeant Coupe, from the moment I met you I knew we would get on. You were chilled out, laid back and a hard working Warrior Sergeant. You were an inspiration to others. You will have made your family proud as you made all of us proud. You will be loved, missed but never forgotten.2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lance Corporal Jonasa Sikivou, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sergeant Coupe, you had a great personality and you were easy going. We always had your ear when we needed help. I heard your alarm go off this morning but you were not around to get up this time, for you were in a far better place.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will miss you but never forget you. You are always in our hearts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Dean Dinsley, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was always there to help if you ever needed him for anything, no matter how small or stupid it was. When maintaining vehicles, if he had shown and told you how to do things a million times, he would still show you again. You will always be missed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Luke Warriss, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Coupes’ is going to be missed. He was a man with a heart of gold, someone who was caring and someone you could talk to. He would do anything for anyone. He will always be in our hearts and loved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private James Butler, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Coupes’, you were an excellent instructor to have on my Warrior driving cadre. You were a fun and lovable person to be around and to drive for. My thoughts are with your wife and two children at this sad time. I will miss you taking the mickey out of my Birmingham accent and you will stay with me forever. God bless and may you rest in peace.</p>

<p>Corporal Jake Hartley, 20, was from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. He joined the Battalion in December 2008 and his potential was immediately recognised. Corporal Hartley had a very bright future in the Army and he was already promoting well ahead of his years, which is testament to his soldiering ability. </p>

<p>Perhaps more importantly, Corporal Hartley had an innate ability to inspire those around him and make them achieve more than they ever imagined was possible.</p>

<p>Corporal Hartley was very popular within the Platoon and the Company at large. He will be remembered as the life and soul of the party, a generous outgoing young man with an exceptionally bright future. He will be sorely missed.</p>

<p>He leaves behind him his mother and stepfather, Nathalie and Mark, brother Ethan and uncle and best friend, Luke. The thoughts and prayers of all those in his Battalion and Combined Force Lashkar Gah are very much with them at this most difficult time.</p>

<p>Corporal Hartley’s family have paid the following tribute:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are devastated at the loss of our son and best friend. Jake was always in the limelight and a larger than life character. He loved Army life and was very determined to do well and achieve his goals. He was kind and generous, a heart of gold with a wicked sense of humour. Above all, he loved his family and friends. We ask that our family’s privacy is respected at this difficult time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning, Commanding Officer, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Corporal Jake Hartley was the ultimate infantry soldier and naturally stood out from his peers. Fit, motivated, yet always understated, he was one of the best. His rise through the ranks had been swift and rightly so; he was a natural leader as exemplified by his top position on the gruelling Infantry Section Commanders Battle Course.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Corporal Hartley was immensely popular with officers and soldiers alike. He was a future star; Regimental Sergeant Major material for sure. We have lost today a selfless, dedicated leader. But our loss is nothing compared to that of his family and friends who have lost one of the most likeable men you could ever meet. Our thoughts and prayers are with them today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Ian Mortimer, Commanding Officer, Combined Force Lashkar Gah (The Queen’s Royal Hussars Battle Group), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We in Combined Force Lashkar Gah are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Corporal Hartley. For those who knew him he was one of the leading lights of his generation. For one so young, such was his ability, he was already a full Corporal. Yet he was utterly inspirational to his soldiers who looked to him for leadership and guidance.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Professional to the end, he was brilliant at his job and a renowned sportsman. Both on and off the sports field he excelled. We have lost an exemplary soldier and an inspirational young leader. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this most difficult and tragic time. We will remember him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Edward Colver, Officer Commanding Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Corporal Hartley was quite simply one of the best Non-Commissioned Officers I have ever had the privilege of working with. From the moment I met him on exercise on the prairies of Canada I knew he was a star of the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>His knowledge of his profession, application and enthusiasm were first class. Corporal Hartley did not only excel as a soldier, he also won Army Cup medals in both Football and Rugby League. He was the Company’s Physical Training Instructor, as well as being an active member of the Corporals Mess. He was a true all rounder.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Corporal Hartley was flying. At only 20 years of age he had completed his Section Commanders’ Battle Course, and was earmarked for Platoon Sergeants course shortly after his tour. Nothing was too difficult for him.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even at this early stage of his career he was a Regimental Sergeant Major in the making. Corporal Hartley went to great lengths to ensure his men were trained and prepared for any task given. He was meticulous in his preparation and expected the same from all of his subordinates. Corporal Hartley went about his work with precision and confidence. I never once heard him complain and could always rely on him to carry out any task with complete confidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He will be sorely missed as a commander, leader and friend. He loved his job, he loved his sport, and he loved his mates. We will never forget him and our thoughts and condolences are with his family at this very difficult time. The Yorkshire Regiment has lost one of its best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Daniel Brennan, 7 Platoon Commander, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Corporal Hartley was a unique and charismatic personality who had the ability to inspire those around him. His passion for life and professional attitude were an example to all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warrant Officer Class 2 Eric Whitehouse, Company Sergeant Major, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Corporal Hartley was the best Junior Non-Commissioned Officer in Corunna Company. He exuded a raw talent and an easy natural leadership. There is no doubt about the fact that he was going to continue his fast rise through the ranks, and was likely to be an Regimental Sergeant Major some day.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having recently gained a very strong pass at the Section Commanders’ Battle Course, he proved that he could compete not only against his peers in the Battalion, but across the wider infantry.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Corporal Hartley had an infectious enthusiasm and boundless energy to match. He was a man that only knew how to put in 100% all of the time. This personality was primed to get the best out of his subordinates and maintain his position as the ultimate role model. Put simply, he was what all young soldiers should aspire to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sergeant Stewart Watts, 7 Platoon Sergeant, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To write this about one of my soldiers is and will be the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. Since I joined Corunna as Platoon Sergeant, ‘JJ’ was my Section Commander. After just finishing Section Commanders’ Battle Course he was the biggest asset I had in my Platoon. Strong, reliable, smart and robust, the list could fill this page of how good a soldier he was.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He wasn’t just a soldier to me, he was a good mate, someone I could trust with anything. He was just one of those lads that brought morale anywhere he went. He was one of the lads that made that impression as soon as he came to the Platoon. He was my gym buddy while we were here and he helped me train.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will never forget what happened, but I know Jake will want us to be strong, and I will be for the lads. He was an absolutely fantastic young man in all areas of life, and is irreplaceable. My best ever Section Commander by far, we will always, and I mean always, remember ‘JJ’. He was just simply one of a kind. All my love, God bless buddy. We all love you buddy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lance Corporal Lee Marshall, Section Commander, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You were a great commander, friend and brother. No words can describe how much you meant to all of us. You were loved and are going to be missed but never forgotten. Once a Blue, always a Blue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lance Corporal Jonasa Sikivou, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JJ mate, buddy, brother in arms. You said ‘see you later buddy’; I didn’t know you were saying goodbye, for we will not meet again in this world. You were a source of inspiration and I will miss and always remember you. Forever in our hearts. Dukes for life. Once a Blue always a Blue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Dean Johnston, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t believe this has happened, it just doesn’t seem true. Corporal Hartley was a very professional Section Commander and a very good friend. He gave us all morale when we were down. We will remember him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Lewis Dixon, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I just want to say thanks for all the laughs and great times we had. You were a proper top lad. We go back 12 years, all the way back to Earlsheaton High School playing push penny for our dinner money.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t believe it was just yesterday that we were talking, laughing and acting like kids. Then just like that you’re taken away from me and the boys. Jake ‘Alley’ Hartley, I’ll never forget you and you will always be in my heart, bro. I love you like my own brother and I always will. Rest well best friend.</p>

<h2 id="private-anthony-frampton">Private Anthony Frampton</h2>

<p>Private Anthony ‘Anton’ Frampton, 20, was from Huddersfield. Prior to joining the Army, Private Frampton attended Royds Hall High School, Huddersfield. On leaving school he spent a period as an apprentice welder before deciding to join the Army.</p>

<p>Private Frampton joined the Army in January 2009 before passing out of training in August 2009 and joining the 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment in Warminster.</p>

<p>Private Frampton was initially employed in Alma Company as a Rifleman. In January 2010 he deployed to the Falkland Islands. On return, Private Frampton volunteered for the Drums Course in Catterick and on completion he joined the Light Platoon, Somme Company. It was here that he displayed his natural physical fitness and amazing character. Fit, robust and intelligent he soon completed training to use the Javelin missile system.</p>

<p>In September 2010, Private Frampton moved to Javelin Platoon and it is here where he really began to shine. A true team player with an infectious sense of humour he possessed a real talent for Armoured Infantry gunnery. In May 2011, Private Frampton deployed on exercise with Javelin Platoon to Canada where he performed excellently, demonstrating determination in adversity and the highest levels of soldiering.</p>

<p>Private Frampton joined Corunna Company prior to deployment to Afghanistan and was employed as an Infantry Dismount and Warrior Gunner.</p>

<p>Private Frampton was an absolute character; hugely popular within Corunna and Somme Companies, but also the wider Battalion. Noticed by all for his carefree nature and love of life, Private Frampton will be missed by all who knew him and had the pleasure of serving alongside him.</p>

<p>He leaves behind him his mother and stepfather, Margaret and Martin, his father Gary, sisters, Gemma and Nicola, great uncle Pat and extended family. The thoughts and prayers of all those in his Battalion and Combined Force Lashkar Gah are very much with them at this most difficult time.</p>

<p>Private Frampton’s family have paid the following tribute:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anton was the life and soul of every party, and always lived life to the full. He had a great sense of humour and always made everybody laugh with his crazy dancing and karaoke singing.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was a fantastic soldier, winning the Soldiers’ Soldier Award in training, and loved being in the Army. We are so proud of him and all that he achieved. He will be missed by all his family and friends and will never be forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning, Commanding Officer, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Anthony Frampton was a unique young man. Fit, carefree, and always the life and soul of his Platoon, he was a true legend amongst his peers. A thoroughly likeable young man, he could motivate and encourage the entire Battalion with his cheekiness and smile.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But behind this cheeky nature lay a truly dedicated infantry soldier, who was committed and brave. This family Battalion has today lost one of its central characters. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Ian Mortimer, Commanding Officer, Combined Force Lashkar Gah (The Queen’s Royal Hussars Battle Group), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We in Combined Force Lashkar Gah are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Private Frampton. For those who knew him, Private Frampton was quite simply the life and soul of 7 Platoon. A real character, he was always laughing and joking.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the more difficult times this ability to see the positive, and laugh in the face of adversity, had the ability to carry those around him, which is priceless. But beneath that he was ever the professional soldier. He was committed to his job and the Company. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this most difficult and tragic time. We will remember him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Edward Colver, Officer Commanding Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Frampton had only been under my command for a few months. In that time he proved himself to be a valuable asset to the Company and a good bloke to have around. Private Frampton showed huge potential. He was ambitious and keen to take more responsibility. I am certain that he would have made a first class Non-Commissioned Officer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I speak on behalf of the whole Company in conveying my deepest sympathy to his family and friends. We have lost a brother, a friend, and a comrade. He will be sorely missed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Jonathon Hinchliffe, Officer Commanding Somme Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Frampton was the first soldier I met when I assumed command of Somme Company. I was immediately amazed by his character, love of life and soldiering ability. Hugely positive and always able to find the fun, he made everyone around him smile.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a soldier, Private Frampton was outstanding, fit and strong, and an amazing team player. In Javelin Platoon he was highly dependable and a master of armoured infantry skills. As a Warrior gunner, he was incredibly reliable and without equal amongst his peers. He was selected to deploy on operations as a Warrior gunner with Corunna Company bringing immense professional knowledge and experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Frampton was an amazing character, a loveable rogue. He was always in the thick of it with his mates. His infectious spirit captivated us all; we love and value him as a highly trusted soldier and friend. I will miss him dearly. Private Frampton will never be forgotten. We will honour him with our actions and in our lasting thoughts. His family are in our prayers, God be with you, and rest in peace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Captain Ian Martin, Officer Commanding Fire Support Group Platoon, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Frampton was a larger than life individual who had an infectious character and a loveable personality which made him one of the most popular members of the platoon.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a soldier Private Frampton was highly capable, confident, competent and extremely fit. Sorely missed, but never forgotten, the thought of Private Frampton to those who knew him will always put a smile on their face. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Daniel Brennan, 7 Platoon Commander, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Frampton was the life and soul of the party. He could raise the spirits of everyone in the room. He was also exceptionally kind and willing to do anything for anyone and his absence will leave a void in the lives of all those that knew him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warrant Officer Class 2 Eric Whitehouse, Company Sergeant Major, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Frampton had only recently transferred to Corunna Company, but he quickly established himself as a key character. He was a happy and an outgoing soldier who was always up for a laugh.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was an experienced Warrior gunner and had been an asset to the Javelin Platoon. He was a man that you simply cannot forget.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sergeant Stewart Watts, Platoon Sergeant, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Framps was something of a platoon legend. He could be relied upon to bring morale when spirits were low and he was always at the centre of things. 7 Platoon could really do with Framps at present. In the short time he has spent with the Platoon he has made lasting friends. He is a legend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corporal Paul Johnstone, Fire Support Group Platoon, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Framps was not just a colleague, he was a soldiers’ soldier, a good man and a close friend. I will remember him for his outrageous laugh and crazy smile. Things will not be the same without him around. My thoughts go out to his family and friends back at home. Sadly missed but never forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lance Corporal Jonasa Sikivou, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Framdog’, you never said goodbye. Who will be our morale booster now you have left? Anthony mate, buddy I never saw you angry but always with a smile on your face. Words out of your mouth gave us laughs and lifted out spirits whenever we were down. You’ll be sorely missed and our heartfelt sympathies and condolences go out to your family. Love you buddy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lance Corporal Luke Wilkinson, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing could bring him down from his own little world. Sometimes I could just sit and watch him without him knowing and just laugh at him. He just had the natural ability to make the best of a bad situation. All he cared about was his mum and told us all daily how much fun he was going to have on Rest and Recuperation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>v”As for me, he will always have a special place in my heart, because right now there’s a large hole in it he has left behind. I just hope that in time it will heal. He will always be remembered and loved by me and all his colleagues, as he has left a huge gap in our lives that only he could fill.”</p>

<p>Private Matthew Riley, Fire Support Group Platoon, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Frampton, aka ‘Framps’ or ‘Frampdog’ was one of my closest friends in and out of work. Everything I have done in the Army was with him. No matter how bad the morale was he always made you smile, there was never a dull moment when he was around.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was like a brother to all of us. A lot of people will remember him for always being in green shorts - he went everywhere in them. He was always close to his mum, sister and Uncle Pat. He always spoke of them and could not wait to get home to see them. RIP mate, you will be missed by everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Aaron Flather, Fire Support Group Platoon, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thing about Private Frampton was he loved making people laugh, he would do anything to make you smile. He was one of the people you could rely on and felt safe around. He was never a quiet person and loved having fun. One of my all-time favourite guys, loved forever, best friend ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="private-christopher-kershaw">Private Christopher Kershaw</h2>

<p>Private Christopher Kershaw, 19, was from Bradford. He joined the Battalion in September 2011 and was immediately put on a Warrior driving cadre. Private Kershaw thoroughly enjoyed working on the Warriors and his natural talent for the role became evident. </p>

<p>Furthermore, Private Kershaw was an extremely effective Light Machine Gun gunner and was subsequently selected to fill this role on operations. He proved himself, in a very short time, to be an excellent soldier and a great friend to many in the Company.</p>

<p>Private Kershaw was a unique and likeable character who quickly made a name for himself in the company. He was devoted to his peers and always delivered what was asked of him. He will be sorely missed.</p>

<p>He leaves behind his parents Brian and Monica, and sister Sarah Louise. The thoughts and prayers of all those in his Battalion and Combined Force Lashkar Gah are very much with them at this most difficult time.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Private Kershaw’s mother Monica paid the following tribute:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chris - our hero. He loved anything to do with the Army from the age of 5 years old. He lived the dream until the end. God bless, Chris, love you loads, Mum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning, Commanding Officer, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Christopher Kershaw was a fiercely fit young man who thrived on soldiering. His natural love of the outdoors shone through in his personal and professional life. Given this passion and his continuous desire to educate himself, he already stood out amongst his peers as a Corporal of the future. We have lost today a true Yorkshire Warrior. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Ian Mortimer, Commanding Officer, Combined Force Lashkar Gah (The Queen’s Royal Hussars Battle Group), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We in Combined Force Lashkar Gah are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Private Chris Kershaw. For those who knew him he was a ‘top lad’. In the short time he was with the Company he was known for being easy going. He never complained, always going that extra mile to help his mates.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Popular, with a keen sense of humour and fun, he was hugely respected. Highly committed and professional he gave his all to 7 Platoon and the Company. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this most difficult and tragic time. We will remember him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Edward Colver, Officer Commanding Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Kershaw joined Corunna Company straight out of training and was immediately trained as a Warrior driver. He showed immediate promise and regularly briefed me on his ambition to be a Section Commander and desire to complete a Junior Non-Commissioned Officers Cadre as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This typified his approach to military life: outgoing and aspiring. I got the feeling he would have stopped at nothing to get where he wanted to be. Never shy of doing the hard yards and always willing to take on extra responsibility, he quickly became a valuable member of the team.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Kershaw had made many friends in both the Company and Battalion. He quickly settled into Army life and thrived on being amongst friends both in camp and outside. My heartfelt thoughts and sympathy are with Private Kershaw’s family and friends. The Yorkshire Regiment have lost a friend and comrade never to be forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Daniel Brennan, 7 Platoon Commander, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Warrant Officer Class 2 Eric Whitehouse, Company Sergeant Major, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Kershaw was a relatively junior soldier, but that didn’t affect his ability to prove himself on every occasion. He quickly settled into battalion life, and had shown himself to be a diligent and caring soldier. A somewhat reserved, astute individual, he always worked hard and had a promising career ahead.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was mature beyond his years, and it was possible to see in him true leadership potential. He was an exceptional Warrior driver and an all-round quality soldier, who enjoyed what he did. He died doing what he loved and at which he excelled. He will be missed, but not forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sergeant Stewart Watts, Platoon Sergeant, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kersh settled in very quickly to life in 7 Platoon and quickly established himself as a ‘good lad’, always willing to help others. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Lance Corporal Lee Marshall, Section Commander, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the moment you arrived to our Platoon you were a hardworking and an easy-going lad. You were an outstanding friend with lots of potential of being a leader of men. You were loved and you will be missed, but never forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lance Corporal Jonasa Sikivou, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Private Shaun Teale, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fellow Bradford lad and Bradford Bulls fan, we used to chat about the weekend’s game. Chris would never say no to you and would give you his last fiver if he was asked. He will be missed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Ryan Mills and Private Luke Stones, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We first met Kershaw on day one of basic training. He was army mad and an encyclopaedia on all things useless. He never moaned about anything and just got on with life. Your useless knowledge on the journey up north will be missed. Take care.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="private-daniel-wade">Private Daniel Wade</h2>

<p>Private Daniel Wade, 20, was from Warrington. He joined the Army in January 2011 and arrived in the Battalion in July 2011. He was immediately placed onto a Warrior driving cadre, which he passed with flying colours. It did not take him long to establish himself as one of the best drivers in the Company. Furthermore, Private Wade was an excellent shot and he proved himself, in a very short time, to be an excellent soldier.</p>

<p>Private Wade was very popular within the Platoon and the Company at large. He committed himself fully to everything and always delivered what was asked of him. He will be remembered as a family man who was devoted to his fiancée Emma, with whom he is expecting a baby girl called Lexie. He will be sorely missed.</p>

<p>He leaves behind his mother Lisa, his sister Stacey, his beloved fiancée Emma and unborn baby, Lexie. The thoughts and prayers of all those in his Battalion and Combined Force Lashkar Gah are very much with them at this most difficult time.</p>

<p>Private Wade’s family have paid the following tribute:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On behalf of all our family, we would like to say Daniel was a loving son, fiancé, brother, nephew, grandson, cousin and friend to many. He would have made a fantastic father to his baby girl Lexie who is due on June 12. We are all devastated to have lost such a wonderful caring, brave man.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Daniel will always remain our hero, he lived for the Army, doing the job he loved so much and it is a testament to Daniel that he lost his life whilst helping rebuild a country torn apart by war. We ask you all to please respect our family’s privacy at this difficult and very sad time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning, Commanding Officer, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Daniel Wade was a new young soldier in this family Battalion. A Cheshire lad in a Yorkshire regiment, Dan arrived keen and energetic and in only a very short period of time had made a real mark within Corunna Company.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quiet and unassuming, he was very committed in all that he did. It is to his credit that he completed his Warrior Driver course so successfully early in his career. His passion for motocross and Superbikes marked him out as a man who loved speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have lost today a young man who had so much to give in his life, both as a son, brother and as a soldier. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Ian Mortimer, Commanding Officer, Combined Force Lashkar Gah (The Queen’s Royal Hussars Battle Group), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We in Combined Force Lashkar Gah are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Private Dan Wade. Although he had not been in the Company for long, for those who knew him he was an ‘up and coming’ soldier. Always seeing the positive, he was well liked and respected by his comrades.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He is remembered by his mates as a family man whose girlfriend was expecting the birth of a daughter during the tour. We have lost a fine young man and professional soldier. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this most difficult and tragic time. We will remember him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Edward Colver, Officer Commanding Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Wade joined Corunna Company in July 2011 and immediately struck me as a confident and personable young man. He volunteered to be a Warrior driver and excelled on his driver training course. Clearly intelligent, he quickly got to grasps with the intricacies of the vehicle and was never happier than when covered in grease cleaning vehicle tracks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Wade had a promising career ahead of him. His attitude, demeanour, and outgoing personality were ideally suited to a life in the military, and I am certain he would have gone far.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My thoughts and condolences are with Private Wade’s family and girlfriend at this terrible time. He will be sorely missed by Corunna Company, The Yorkshire Regiment and his comrades.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Daniel Brennan, 7 Platoon Commander, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Warrant Officer Class 2 Eric Whitehouse, Company Sergeant Major, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Wade was a quality soldier. He was reliable, honest and hardworking. He was a family-orientated man who cared greatly for his girlfriend and talked warmly of looking forward to seeing his unborn child at the end of the tour.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He had settled in well into the Battalion life and proved himself to be more than competent in all he did. He was a man with focus, who would have been successful over a lengthy career in the Army. He was a devoted man, with emotional depth and a clear intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sergeant Stewart Watts, Platoon Sergeant, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wadey was a great bloke and a great soldier who could be relied upon at all times. Wadey was a family-orientated man who was expecting a baby girl called Lexie during the tour. He will be remembered with great affection by everyone in 7 Platoon.</p>

  <p>An up-and-coming young solider that put great heart in to everything he did. He volunteered for tasks when no one else would, and that’s what made him stand out from the rest and made him a great leader of men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Thomas Horne, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wadey was a friendly lad and a good mate. Always there with a helping hand. My thoughts are with his girlfriend and his soon-to-be-born baby during this difficult time. They will both be proud of you mate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Luke Stones, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I first met Wadey in Catterick in training. He was in the platoon ahead of me but always willing to offer advice and support. He was a good lad and wasn’t shy to lend a helping hand to any of the lads. Nothing was too much trouble where the lads were concerned.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He constantly spoke about his girlfriend and unborn baby girl. I know for a fact he would have been a brilliant dad. He told me not too long ago he wanted to name his baby girl Lexie. My daughter is called Lexi too. Wadey, I can’t believe you’re never going to get the chance to meet her. I know you’re going to be looking down on her wherever you are. Love you mate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Aiden Walker, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Words can’t describe how fearless and up for the job he was and how much he loved his work. Since day one of basic training, it was clear all Wadey ever wanted was to be a soldier. He loved his mum, girlfriend and unborn child more than words will ever describe. I am sure he is now with his father up in a better place. I wish the best for his family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private James Butler, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What am I going to do for a lift home on weekends now buddy? You can now watch over your new baby and girlfriend and keep them safe on their journey of grievance and lives together. Love you mate.</p>

<h2 id="private-daniel-wilford">Private Daniel Wilford</h2>

<p>Private Daniel Wilford, 21, was from Huddersfield. He joined 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment in April 2010. He deployed to Canada as a Warrior Gunner in June 2011 before deploying to Afghanistan in the same role in February 2012. He was an extremely effective Warrior gunner and had a thorough knowledge of the vehicle and its weapon systems. Away from military life he enjoyed playing golf and darts with his friends. He was a truly sociable person.</p>

<p>Private Wilford was very popular within Corunna Company. He was always up for a laugh with the boys and was always willing to help his comrades. Private Wilford proved himself as a soldier and as a friend whilst in Corunna Company and his absence will be felt deeply by all that had the honour of serving with him. He will be missed.</p>

<p>He leaves behind his mother and stepfather, Diane and Paul, his brother Alex and his grandparents. The thoughts and prayers of all those in his Battalion and Combined Force Lashkar Gah are with them at this most difficult time.</p>

<p>Private Wilford’s family have paid the following tribute:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Daniel was a kind and loving son, brother, grandson, nephew and cousin who was always full of energy. He never rested and was always out and about living life to the full having fun. He will be very much missed by everyone who knew him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Zac Stenning, Commanding Officer, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Daniel Wilford was the archetypal Yorkshire infantry soldier; quiet, unassuming but with bags of character. He was unique, happy go lucky and confident, his smile could light up a room. A thoroughly honest and dedicated infantryman, his friends and colleagues trusted and respected him. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family on this difficult day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Ian Mortimer, Commanding Officer, Combined Force Lashkar Gah (The Queen’s Royal Hussars Battle Group), said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We in Combined Force Lashkar Gah are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Private Wilford. For those who knew him, Private Wilford was a real character who enjoyed a really good laugh. Hardworking and professional, he knew how to balance work and play and enjoyed a good party.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet today we remember him as an excellent soldier who was committed to his mates in 7 Platoon and Corunna Company. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this most difficult and tragic time. We will remember him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Edward Colver, Officer Commanding Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Wilford joined Corunna Company in June 2010. A quiet unassuming character he went about his daily business in a professional and competent manner. He was an exceptional Warrior gunner, it was often noted how proficient he was in the turret and his calmness put many a commander to shame.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Wilford had proven himself as an extremely competent soldier and was being considered as a potential junior Non-Commissioned Officer, probably against his wishes! That was the man he was, unassuming, uncomplicated, and honest to the core.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was hugely popular amongst the lads and will be sorely missed by Corunna Company, his comrades and his friends. My sincerest condolences are with his family and friends at this difficult time, he will be sorely missed and forever be in our thoughts and prayers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Daniel Brennan, 7 Platoon Commander, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Wilford was a very honest, gentle and hard working young man who found it easy to make friends. He touched the lives of all who knew him and will be missed by all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warrant Officer Class 2 Eric Whitehouse, Company Sergeant Major, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private Wilford was an honest, quiet soldier, who excelled in his primary role. As a Warrior gunner few could question his skills. He proved himself to be an honest and dedicated soldier.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was a sociable but unassuming man. He was always smiling and could remain positive in the harshest of conditions. It was in this way he was an inspiration to those around him. He was very popular with the lads and a real professional soldier. He will be sorely missed by all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sergeant Stewart Watts, Platoon Sergeant, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wilf was a very kind and good fun bloke who was always up for a laugh with the lads. He was very popular with the platoon and his absence will leave a great void in the platoon. He will be remembered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lance Corporal Lee Marshall, Section Commander, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will never forget your smile for years to come. We will remember you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Zondwayo Jere, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t believe that you have left us early like this. I will always remember you as you were such a good lad. You have left a gap that will never be filled. May your soul rest in peace. Until we meet again. May God bless you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Luke Warriss, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wilf the man, he was someone who could get a laugh going. He had nothing but time for everyone. If you needed to smile he was the man you went to see. He is going to be missed by everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Shaun Teale, 7 Platoon, Corunna Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Wilford came to 3 YORKS for the first time I was on guard. I thought he was lost, then he pulled out his ID card, and the next day he was in my platoon. He lived for the weekend but wasn’t work-shy. He was always there when jobs needed to be done, and was an all-round good lad.</p>
