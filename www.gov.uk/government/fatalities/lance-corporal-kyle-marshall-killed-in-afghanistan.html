  <figcaption>Lance Corporal Kyle Marshall
[Picture: via MOD]</figcaption></figure><p>Lance Corporal Marshall was deployed on an operation to reassure and improve security for the population in an area in the south of the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province when he was fatally wounded by an improvised explosive device.</p>

<p>Lance Corporal Marshall deployed to Afghanistan on 17 October 2010 with B Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment. He was based in Patrol Base 4 in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province. On 14 February 2011 he deployed as part of a platoon to a rural area near the village of Padaka.</p>

<p>His mission was to dominate the ground near a recently occupied checkpoint to deter insurgent forces from attacking ISAF and Afghan National Army bases and the local population. At 1130hrs Lance Corporal Marshall was fatally wounded by an improvised explosive device while extracting from a compound following an engagement with insurgents.</p>

<h2 id="lance-corporal-kyle-marshall">Lance Corporal Kyle Marshall</h2>

<p>Lance Corporal Marshall was born on 30 October 1987. He attended the Churchill Community College, Newcastle. His hometown was Newcastle, although he lived in Colchester. He completed his basic training in August 2007 and was posted to the 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment. He initially served in D Company, completing Op HERRICK 8 as a Private soldier. He rapidly established his leadership credentials and was promoted to Lance Corporal in January 2010 and assigned to B Company.</p>

<p>Lance Corporal Marshall was an outstanding soldier and non-commissioned officer. He was a leading figure in B Company during the training for Afghanistan. A popular and cheerful soldier, he was a natural leader who enthused all of those amongst whom he worked. He was a keen footballer, passionate Newcastle United supporter, and had played to county level in his youth.</p>

<p>He leaves behind his father Garry, his mother Olywn and his fiancée, Hayley, whom he was due to marry after the tour.</p>

<p>The family of Lance Corporal Kyle Marshall have made the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kyle was a very lively, outgoing, loving and much-loved son. He will be sadly missed by all his family and friends. He was due to be married in July to his fiancée, Hayley. We take comfort in the fact that he is now with his granddad who died some years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Harrison, Commanding Officer, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lance Corporal Kyle Marshall was one of the most popular young commanders in the Battalion. A charismatic, upbeat Geordie, he was ice-cool under fire and a natural leader always. He mentored, coaxed and taught his soldiers with consummate passion and consistent diligence. He was ever-optimistic, even in the bleakest of circumstances, and could charm all he met. He is irreplaceable.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He died as he lived, at the front, guiding his men, surrounded by friends and at the very tip of the Battalion spear. In the very moments before he passed away, he led his team in the discovery of a huge bomb making factory. Thirty-five devices and a plethora of explosive components were subsequently found in the building. This discovery will undoubtedly save numerous colleagues and locals falling prey to the most insidious of insurgent threats.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>His friends have lost the closest of mates and the most able of colleagues. The Battalion has lost a stunning young leader and a bright hope for the future. Hayley ‘s loss is unimaginable. We wish her and all Kyle ‘s family our most heartfelt condolences. Rest in Peace. Utrinque Paratus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Mike Shervington, Second-in-Command, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lance Corporal Kyle Marshall will always be remembered, and toasted, as a soldier and leader of the highest calibre. Irrepressible, unflinching and wholly loyal, he stood out as someone who could absorb anything and still emerge smiling with a brilliant one-liner to sum everything up.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was exceptional in D Company two and a half years ago, one of my very best and clearly destined for stardom. He had formed an unbreakable bond with 3 or 4 others, they know who they are, and they were at the centre of everything we did during that long summer. But underneath the banter was a man wholly devoted to his family and his soon-to-be-wife Hayley, and our thoughts are with them during this awful time. I hope that they can draw a little comfort from the esteem with which he was held, in a Regiment which he adored serving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Nick Copperwaite, Officer Commanding B Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lance Corporal Marshall was a seasoned professional on his second tour of Afghanistan. Always cheerful and enthusiastic, even in conditions of extreme adversity, he served as a fine example to the young soldiers in B Company. A natural leader, he was a resolute and determined man, full of courage and life; a true Paratrooper.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will all miss his constant smile, his ability to discover something positive in everything that he encountered and his level headed excellence as a soldier. He will stand tall and proud in the memories of those who fought alongside him. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. Utrinque Paratus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warrant Officer Class 2 (Company Sergeant Major) Adam Proud, B Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lance Corporal Marshall was a friend and colleague. He will be greatly missed by all members of B Company 2 PARA. Leading Private soldiers from the front was his forte and he was respected by them for his determination and drive. Being a paratrooper is not a job but a way of life and Lance Corporal Marshall had entered into it full heartily, with enthusiasm and motivation which constantly rubbed off on the more junior members of the company. His way of command would always get the best from his men due to the very nature of the person he was.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a sense of humour larger than life it would be hard not to smile when doing your job next to Lance Corporal Marshall. My thoughts are with his family and fiancée at the moment and I would like to offer my full support to them. I will never forget the good times Marsh even if they were always in the armoury. Utrinque Paratus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Will McCarthy, 5 Platoon Commander, B Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment,said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lance Corporal Marshall was so proud of being a Junior Non-Commissioned Officer in the Parachute Regiment. His diligence and attention to detail ensured he had been a constant at the front of his multiple. This was exactly where he wanted to be; he led from the front and he led by example.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was unswervingly optimistic. Not once did we encounter a situation that he could not find the positive in. He had an infectious enthusiasm for all things ‘paratrooper ‘ but also a kind heart, always willing to develop those soldiers who looked up to him so much.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No half measures, no cut corners - that was how Lance Corporal Marshall worked and it rubbed off on all of us. Personally I shall miss him greatly and 5 Platoon has lost a fine soldier and a dear friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his fiancée and family. Utrinque Paratus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sergeant Darren Chambers, 4 Platoon Sergeant, B Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I first came across Kyle whilst I was serving as a Parachute Regiment instructor, though he wasn ‘t my platoon, I soon noticed this fellow Geordie for his high energy and enthusiasm, especially for his beloved Newcastle United.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I later came across Kyle back in 2 PARA and reacquainted myself with him; again he was oozing with energy and the competence of an excellent Paratrooper. Having been promoted he gained confidence and commanded respect from all ranks. This was a man with big ambitions and the ability to get things done. He will be missed by all he touched.
Corporal Wayne Smith, Acting 5 Platoon Sergeant, B Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kyle was the sort of person who would always be there when you needed him. He did like to talk - he may not always have said the right thing but it would almost certainly cheer you up. He was mischievous; always planning his next bit of fun with the guys. It is so sad that he has been taken away from us but although he is not here in person I will never forget his presence.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My thoughts are with his family and fiancée, Hayley. I am sorry for your loss. He will be sorely missed, loved forever and never forgotten. Kyle was always talking about his future plans and his family. He loved you all greatly and he loved his job so please remember all the good times you had as that is what he would want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lance Corporal Adam Brand, 5 Platoon, B Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A true friend, a true paratrooper, a true hero: Kyle Marshall - a man that could talk until the sun went down; always striving to be as airborne in battle as every paratrooper should be. You gave the ultimate sacrifice my friend; you will always remain in the heart and soul of the Parachute Regiment.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Forever missed, never forgotten. See you on the other side mate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lance Corporal Jason Tippins, Intelligence Cell, A Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I first met Kyle when we came to 10 Platoon D Company, being a fellow northerner we hit it off straight away. When I got a married quarter he moved into my bed space so I knew where to find him or I would just listen out for his loud Geordie accent. I lent him kit when he first arrived expecting to get it back but I will let him have this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know he was close to his dad, going out on the lash in Newcastle and on holidays to Las Vegas together. I last saw him on the operation in Padaka and had a chat with him. He was chuntering as usual but I knew he loved being amongst the blokes doing his job. I ‘m sure we ‘ll miss him asking if he was getting any bigger with his big smile and not so good teeth.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Next time we are in Colchester having a drink in The Wig and Pen I’m sure everyone will notice a gap in the banter and no loud Geordie Kyle gobbing off. He will be missed by all who knew him. RIP mate, will see you one day.
Lance Corporal Robert O ‘Neil, 11 Platoon, D Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lance Corporal Marshall loved to hate his job in 2 PARA. He loved doing the job but as anyone that knew him will say, he loved to chunter whilst doing it even more. At the same time he was hugely proud of being a paratrooper.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel I have been robbed of a massive friend who I will miss for the rest of my life, as will everyone who had him in their lives. He was a true paratrooper, great at his job in the field but a pain in the rear at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have no doubt he is already being a pain in the rear looking down at us all, gobbing off about being ally with a massive overhung beret and trying to grow sideburns. It can ‘t be put into words how we all felt about him but it can be said that we have lost a member of our airborne family who will be truly missed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Oliver, 5 Platoon, B Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I didn’t know Marsh for long, but for the time I did he was always ‘proper sound ‘. He always made us laugh and was a really good lad. He was always there if I needed him to talk to and he always led by example. I found him really inspiring and saw him as a really good friend - he will be sorely missed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Welsh, 5 Platoon, B Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kyle was like a brother to me. Even though he was younger than me I looked up to him. He inspired me to be a better soldier and helped me and everyone in the multiple to stay strong and focussed. I will always hold a place in my heart for him and will always miss him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Duffy, 5 Platoon, B Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Goodnight brother. Thanks for being my mate and for making me smile when times were low. You will be deeply missed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private Morrison, 5 Platoon, B Company, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am absolutely gutted mate. You always made me laugh and were always good with the banter. Most importantly you were always on the ball with the soldiering and you are going to be missed by all. Going to miss you mate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Lance Corporal Kyle Marshall. The tributes paid by his colleagues in 2 PARA describe a brave and resolute man, and a consummate professional who will be deeply missed. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this sad time.</p>
