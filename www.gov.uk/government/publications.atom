    <title>Strategic environmental assessment about revoking the South West regional strategy: environmental report</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environmental report is a consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revocation of the South West regional planning guidance and the regional economic strategy (which together form the regional strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report succeeds the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919194318/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/revocationswrss"&gt;previous environmental report&lt;/a&gt; on the revocation of the South West regional strategy which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012. It is a stand alone document the intention of which is to provide the reader with an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of the revocation of the South West regional planning guidance and the regional economic strategy without the need to refer back to the previous environmental report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report proposes to retain the saved structure plan policy S6 from the ‘Somerset and Exmoor National Park joint structure plan’ relating to the green belt in North East Somerset. Removing this policy before the council has adopted a local plan which defines green belt boundaries could put green belt land at risk from unwanted development. This is in line with the coalition agreement to safeguard the green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to the size of the documents this publication can also be supplied on a CD-ROM. Please email requests to &lt;a href="mailto:SEAConsultation@communities.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;SEAConsultation@communities.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local authority green belt statistics for England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on the extent of the green belt in England were released under the auspices of the UK Statistics Authority on 30 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The extent of the designated green belt land in England in 2011/12 was estimated at 1,639,410 hectares, about 13% of the land area of England. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overall there has been a decrease of 130 hectares from the revised 2010-11 green belt. This is due to three authorities who have adopted new plans in which they have changed the boundaries of the green belt. This represents a decrease of less than 0.01% per cent in the total green belt area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since these statistics were first compiled for 1997, there has been an increase in the area of green belt after taking account of the redesignation of some green belt as part of the New Forest National Park in 2005.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Firefighters' pension scheme: increases to employee contribution rates from 1 April 2013</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statutory consultation seeks views on the proposed increase in employee contribution rates from 1 April 2013 for members of the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (1992) and New Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has also considered the impact of the proposed 2013 to 2014 pension contribution increases on protected groups (like older scheme members, those on maternity leave or part time workers) and this is set out in the partial equality statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Driver and rider tests and instructor statistics: quarter 2 2012/13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents information on the number and pass rates of driving and riding practical tests conducted in Great Britain for the quarter to 30 September 2012 and statistics from the Approved Driving Instructor register and the Integrated Register of Driver Trainers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test and instructor statistics are derived from data held by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA), which administers the driving test and training schemes in Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A total of 421,374 tests were conducted across all test categories between July and September 2012 (quarter 2 2012/13). This is a decrease of 5.3% in comparison to the same quarter last year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The reduction in the number of tests conducted in quarter 2 2012/13 is likely to have been due to the continuing economic situation, national events such as the Olympics, and pass rate improvement in the car practical test leading to fewer retests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test categories included are B (car), B1 (tricycles and quadricycles), A, A1 and A2 (motorcycles), C, C1 (medium and large goods vehicles), C+E, C1+E (medium/large goods vehicles with trailers), D, D1 (minibuses and buses), D+E and D1+E (minibuses/buses with trailers).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Road freight statistics: quarter 1 2011</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents quarterly information on the domestic and international road freight activity of UK hauliers and of foreign hauliers in UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information is based on results from the following three continuous surveys administered by the Department for Transport:
* Continuing Survey of Road Goods Transport Great Britain (CSRGT GB)
* Continuing Survey of Road Goods Transport Northern Ireland (CSRGT NI)
* International Road Haulage Survey (IRHS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics on foreign hauliers in the UK are derived from data supplied to Eurostat by EU-27 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Q1 2011 data in this publication are provisional and will be finalised in an annual Road Freight Statistics publication in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between Q1 2010 and Q1 2011, goods moved by UK HGVs in the UK increased by 6% to over 37 billion tonne kilometres. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Domestic freight activity trends for the UK in recent years broadly mirror those in three of the four other largest EU economies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Q1 2011, there were 1.3 million tonnes of road freight exported from the UK by UK-registered vehicles. This was an increase of 9 per cent compared to Q1 2010. There was a similar weight of goods imported in Q1 2011 (1.4 million tonnes).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011, there were about 1 billion tonne kilometres of cabotage by foreign hauliers in the UK. Levels of cabotage reported by EU-27 countries in the UK have declined in recent years. The level was 44% lower in 2011 than in 2005.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="technical-information"&gt;Technical information:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on road freight statistics and the three DfT surveys, as well as the pre-release access list, and related technical documentation &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/technical-guidance-for-transport-statistics-part-2#road-freight-statistics"&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Relocation of Falkirk driving test centre to Grangemouth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) has closed the driving test centre at Falkirk and opened a new one in Grangemouth. This is to improve facilities for driving examiners and candidates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new test centre opened on 9 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; considers that driving test candidates and staff won’t have any significant or detrimental impact on their journeys to the centre, or on its driving test routes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Approving drink-drive rehabilitation courses</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation is about updating the arrangements for providing training courses under the drink-drive rehabilitation scheme, including how they’re funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals build on the government policy in the ‘Strategic framework for road safety’ by providing improved education for convicted drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is that these proposals will: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create better quality courses which will encourage more offenders to take training and reduce the likelihood of them reoffending&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make sure that courses are available in every part of the country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make sure that courses are of the same standard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allow the Driving Standards Agency to take action against trainers not providing courses as they should&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="decisions"&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new scheme will make sure that courses are available in every part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monitor course providers to make sure that courses are all of the same standard – we’ll charge fees to cover our costs for doing this&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take action against course providers who are not up to standard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give course providers the right to appeal if their application is refused or if we remove their course approval&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give existing course providers enough time to move over to the new scheme, if that’s what they want to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;let course providers use first or second class post for sending out notices to offenders, as long as they get a receipt of posting and keep it for their records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training providers can decide the cost of the course, but it can’t cost more than £250.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="important-dates"&gt;Important dates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;What’s happening&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Invitations to apply issued&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7 January 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Closing date for receipt of applications&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8 February 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;New courses start&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;24 June 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Approval of existing courses runs out&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;18 August 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

    <title>Speed limit exemptions</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes that section 19 of the Road Safety Act (2006) be brought into effect. This would replace section 87 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act (1984) in relation to exemptions from speed limits for certain vehicle purposes. Regulations are needed to bring it into effect and set out the detail of how it would work. This document contains the department’s proposed approach to implementing the regulations in Section 19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes would have two major effects. Firstly it will allow certain other vehicle purposes to be included in speed limit exemption regulations. Secondly it will prescribe a high speed training course that drivers must undertake (or be in the process of taking) before they are permitted to exceed speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation document also considers regulations related to 5 other exemptions from road traffic laws (related to signals, signalled crossings, certain signs and motorway hard shoulders) It includes proposals to amend some of these other provisions at the same time that section 19 is commenced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document will also seek views about the planned introduction of a further exemption from seat belt requirements related to the treatment of patients in the back of ambulances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Rail decentralisation: devolving decision-making on passenger rail services in England</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most train services in England are specified, funded and managed centrally by the Department for Transport based in London. Passenger Transport Executives’ (&lt;abbr title="Passenger Transport Executives"&gt;PTEs&lt;/abbr&gt;) and local authorities’ influence over the rail services provided in their local area is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with its aspirations for localism, the government is seeking to devolve, where appropriate, more accountability and decision-making related to local rail services to sub-national bodies, such as local authorities and &lt;abbr title="Passenger Transport Executives"&gt;PTEs&lt;/abbr&gt;. This consultation explores how this might be done in parts of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="why-we-are-consulting"&gt;Why we are consulting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wishes to seek views on whether improved outcomes for transport users might be achieved in some cases if more decisions relating to local rail services were made closer to the communities they serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also inviting sub-national bodies - &lt;abbr title="Passenger Transport Executives"&gt;PTEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and local authorities - to indicate their interest and come forward with outline proposals for taking on decision-making responsibility for passenger rail services in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation complements the command paper, ‘Reforming our railways’, published today. That sets out the government’s vision for rail and responds to Sir Roy McNulty’s independent report on value for money on the railways.&lt;/p&gt;
