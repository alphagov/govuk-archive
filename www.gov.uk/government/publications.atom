    <title>Approving drink-drive rehabilitation courses</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation is about updating the arrangements for providing training courses under the drink-drive rehabilitation scheme, including how they’re funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals build on the government policy in the ‘Strategic framework for road safety’ by providing improved education for convicted drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is that these proposals will: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create better quality courses which will encourage more offenders to take training and reduce the likelihood of them reoffending&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make sure that courses are available in every part of the country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make sure that courses are of the same standard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allow the Driving Standards Agency to take action against trainers not providing courses as they should&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="decisions"&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new scheme will make sure that courses are available in every part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monitor course providers to make sure that courses are all of the same standard – we’ll charge fees to cover our costs for doing this&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take action against trainers who are not up to standard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give trainers the right to appeal if their application is refused or if we take away their right to give the training&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give existing trainers enough time to move over to the new scheme, if that’s what they want to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;let course providers use first or second class post for sending out notices to offenders, as long as they get a receipt of posting and keep it for their records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training providers can decide the cost of the course, but it can’t cost more than £250.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="important-dates"&gt;Important dates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;What’s happening&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Invitations to apply issued&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7 January 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Closing date for receipt of applications&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8 February 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;New courses start&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;24 June 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Approval of existing courses runs out&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;18 August 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

    <title>Speed limit exemptions</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes that section 19 of the Road Safety Act (2006) be brought into effect. This would replace section 87 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act (1984) in relation to exemptions from speed limits for certain vehicle purposes. Regulations are needed to bring it into effect and set out the detail of how it would work. This document contains the department’s proposed approach to implementing the regulations in Section 19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes would have two major effects. Firstly it will allow certain other vehicle purposes to be included in speed limit exemption regulations. Secondly it will prescribe a high speed training course that drivers must undertake (or be in the process of taking) before they are permitted to exceed speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation document also considers regulations related to 5 other exemptions from road traffic laws (related to signals, signalled crossings, certain signs and motorway hard shoulders) It includes proposals to amend some of these other provisions at the same time that section 19 is commenced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document will also seek views about the planned introduction of a further exemption from seat belt requirements related to the treatment of patients in the back of ambulances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Rail decentralisation: devolving decision-making on passenger rail services in England</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most train services in England are specified, funded and managed centrally by the Department for Transport based in London. Passenger Transport Executives’ (&lt;abbr title="Passenger Transport Executives"&gt;PTEs&lt;/abbr&gt;) and local authorities’ influence over the rail services provided in their local area is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with its aspirations for localism, the government is seeking to devolve, where appropriate, more accountability and decision-making related to local rail services to sub-national bodies, such as local authorities and &lt;abbr title="Passenger Transport Executives"&gt;PTEs&lt;/abbr&gt;. This consultation explores how this might be done in parts of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="why-we-are-consulting"&gt;Why we are consulting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wishes to seek views on whether improved outcomes for transport users might be achieved in some cases if more decisions relating to local rail services were made closer to the communities they serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also inviting sub-national bodies - &lt;abbr title="Passenger Transport Executives"&gt;PTEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and local authorities - to indicate their interest and come forward with outline proposals for taking on decision-making responsibility for passenger rail services in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation complements the command paper, ‘Reforming our railways’, published today. That sets out the government’s vision for rail and responds to Sir Roy McNulty’s independent report on value for money on the railways.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local authority revenue expenditure and financing in England: 2011 to 2012 final outturn</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on the final outturn estimates of local authority revenue expenditure and financing for 2011-12 were released on 27 November 2012 under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total revenue expenditure by local authorities in England was £99.3 billion in 2011-12, a decrease from £104.3 billion in 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;26.6% of revenue expenditure in 2011-12 was funded through council tax, 29.7% through formula grant and 46.1% through specific grants inside aggregate external finance and local services support grant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12 local authorities added £2.6 billion to their reserves. This includes figures for the Greater London Authority (GLA), who added £0.6 billion to their reserves. Excluding GLA, authorities added £2.0 billion to their reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities net current expenditure for education services was £40.2 billion in 2011-12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education expenditure for 2011-12 is not comparable to previous years due to a number of schools changing their status to become academies, which are centrally funded rather than funded by local authorities. There has also been a transfer of responsibilities between the NHS and local government relating to adults with learning difficulties in long stay NHS institutions. As a result of this discontinuity between the two financial years (2010-11 and 2011-12), it is difficult to compare total net current expenditure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Nationally significant infrastructure planning: expanding and improving the ‘one stop shop’ approach for consents</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 6 September 2012, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister set out a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-boost-british-housebuilding-jobs-and-the-economy"&gt;major package of reforms to housing and planning&lt;/a&gt; to help create conditions for economic growth. This announcement included a commitment to ‘work to extend the principle of a one-stop-shop for non-planning consents for major infrastructure’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this consultation is to seek views from interested bodies on what consents should be moved within the scope of an expanded ‘one stop shop’ for major infrastructure and on proposals for streamlining the current list of statutory consultees that developers are required to consult before applying for a development consent order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate consultation we are seeking views on proposals to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/nationally-significant-infrastructure-planning-extending-the-regime-to-business-and-commercial-projects"&gt;extend the nationally significant infrastructure planning regime to business and commercial projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Nationally significant infrastructure planning: extending the regime to business and commercial projects</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help speed up planning decisions for the most complex projects and to increase choice for developers, the government proposes to extend the scope of the Planning Act 2008 so that a wider range of development can be brought within the nationally significant infrastructure planning regime. This will allow developers of nationally significant business or commercial projects to apply to the Secretary of State for the option of using the streamlined planning regime set out in the Planning Act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views about the proposal to extend the nationally significant infrastructure regime and, in particular, about the types and forms of business and commercial projects to be prescribed in regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A better deal for mobile home owners</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes a number of reforms to the park homes sector, aimed at tackling a number of complaints made by residents of some mobile home site operators. These can include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking an owner’s sale of their home - without justifiable reason&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neglecting their sites and failing to make adequate repairs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;charging excessive pitch fees, breaching site rules and stopping owners from improving their homes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures are designed to ensure site operators who behave responsibly can continue to operate as they do already whilst the rogue operators are properly tackled - as well as being made to meet the cost of their negligence rather than the taxpayer picking up the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring compliance with site licence conditions by enabling the courts to impose unlimited fines on operators who do not manage their sites properly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allowing local authorities to make a reasonable charge on site operators for their licensing services, which they are currently unable to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving local authorities the power to carry out works on sites in an emergency or where the site operator has been found guilty of a breach of the licence, and charge the cost back to them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strengthening the rules around the sale of mobile homes so that unscrupulous operators cannot interfere with owners selling to a qualifying buyer who they have chosen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changing legislation to improve other residents’ rights to reflect their status as home owners by, for example, allowing them to carry out home improvements without seeking permission&lt;/li&gt;
