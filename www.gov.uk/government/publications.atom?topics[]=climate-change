    <title>Guidance for local planning authorities on implementing planning requirements of the EU Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) (‘the Directive’) provides an overarching legislative framework for the management of waste across Europe. This guidance note provides advice on the measures required by local planning authorities to ensure compliance with the directive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance is aimed primarily at waste planning authorities, but it highlights the main legal and policy provisions of relevance to all planning authorities, and the action we expect them to take to assist them in ensuring compliance with the directive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be read alongside the government’s planning policy for waste management, currently set out in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-for-sustainable-waste-management-planning-policy-statement-10"&gt;Planning Policy Statement 10&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-for-sustainable-waste-management-a-companion-guide-to-planning-policy-statement-10"&gt;companion guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation guidance for suppliers</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (&lt;abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation"&gt;RTFO&lt;/abbr&gt;) scheme requires suppliers of road transport fuel to ensure that a certain proportion of it comes from sustainable renewable sources. Guidance has been in place to assist suppliers with compliance since the &lt;abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation"&gt;RTFO&lt;/abbr&gt; was first introduced. Obligated suppliers are consulted each year on revisions to the guidance. These have taken into account the latest European and domestic legislative developments and experience in operating the obligation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport asked Ecofys to produce a report on the current animal fat (tallow) market to assess whether there has been any impact from allowing double counting of biodiesel produced from category 1 tallow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is intended to explain the issue, the risks, and the available data relating to the tallow market to enable the department to set out its approach to monitoring impacts and also seek stakeholder feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Energy Performance of Buildings Directive article 8 equivalence - UK biennial reports</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, published in January 2003, is designed to improve the energy efficiency of buildings across Europe. Article 8 of the Directive is specifically aimed at improving the performance of heating systems. The directive offers two alternatives for implementing article 8: option (a) which involves the implementation of an inspection regime; or option (b) which involves the provision of advice, but this option can also include ‘alternative solutions’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has chosen to adopt option (b) and has prepared biennial Article 8 equivalence reports to demonstrate that this approach has an impact that is ‘broadly equivalent’ to that produced through the provisions of option (a).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reports were produced in January 2008 and November 2010 and we are publishing them in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environmental report is a consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revocation of the South West regional planning guidance and the regional economic strategy (which together form the regional strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report proposes to retain the saved structure plan policy S6 from the ‘Somerset and Exmoor National Park joint structure plan’ relating to the green belt in North East Somerset. Removing this policy before the council has adopted a local plan which defines green belt boundaries could put green belt land at risk from unwanted development. This is in line with the coalition agreement to safeguard the green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local authority green belt statistics for England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on the extent of the green belt in England were released under the auspices of the UK Statistics Authority on 30 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The extent of the designated green belt land in England in 2011/12 was estimated at 1,639,410 hectares, about 13% of the land area of England. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overall there has been a decrease of 130 hectares from the revised 2010-11 green belt. This is due to three authorities who have adopted new plans in which they have changed the boundaries of the green belt. This represents a decrease of less than 0.01% per cent in the total green belt area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since these statistics were first compiled for 1997, there has been an increase in the area of green belt after taking account of the redesignation of some green belt as part of the New Forest National Park in 2005.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Low carbon bus calculator</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the benefits of purchasing a low carbon bus will be different for each operator and will depend on the way in which the bus in service is used. So, Department for Transport economists have produced a transparent, user-friendly toolkit to be used by bus operators and local authorities to calculate the likely benefits on investing in a low carbon emission bus (&lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;). Your assessment should always compare the &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; to an equivalent diesel bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit allows you flexibility in changing the input assumptions to those most relevant to you. You will be able to assess the financial implications of purchasing a &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;, based on the fuel savings on offer (as advised by &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; manufacturers or experienced in trials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spreadsheet tool is intended to provide indicative estimates only and &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; does not vouch for the accuracy of such estimates. Please note that the Department for Transport does not accept any liability for any decisions that may be taken on the basis of such estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit will be routinely updated and refined. Details of any updates or changes that are made will be outlined in the ‘Intro’ worksheet of the toolkit. We therefore encourage you to visit this website regularly and download the toolkit to ensure you are using the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Biofuel statistics: Year 4 (2011/12), report 5</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents statistics on the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for the obligation year 15 April 2011 to 14 April 2012 (Year 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes information on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of UK road transport fuel from renewable and fossil fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) which have been issued to sustainable renewable fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the balance of RTFCs by obligation period;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trades of RTFCs between suppliers and/or traders; and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carbon and sustainability (C&amp;amp;S) characteristics of the renewable fuel supplied ¹.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-headline-figures-are"&gt;The headline figures are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six billion litres of renewable transport fuel have been supplied in the 48 months since the RTFO began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="in-year-4-14-april-2011-to-15-april-2012-of-the-rtfo"&gt;In Year 4 (14 April 2011 to 15 April 2012) of the RTFO:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.6 billion litres of renewable fuel have been supplied, which is 3.6% of total road transport fuel reported to the RTFO Administrator against an annual obligation of 4.0%. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More biodiesel (57%) has been supplied than bioethanol (43%). There were also small volumes of biogas, biomethanol and pure vegetable oil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1.7 billion RTFCs have been issued of which 464 million were for double counting feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="from-15-dec-2011-to-14-apr-2012"&gt;From 15 Dec 2011 to 14 Apr 2012:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;43% of the Year 4 RTFCs were issued to biofuel supplied in this period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The largest proportion of renewable fuel was derived from used cooking oil (229 million litres, 45% of total biofuel supplied). The most widely reported source (by feedstock and country of origin) for biodiesel was used cooking oil from the Netherlands (48 million litres, 18% of biodiesel supplied). The most widely sourced bioethanol was corn from the United States of America (163 million litres, 69% of bioethanol supplied).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;12% of renewable fuel was sourced from UK feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An aggregate greenhouse gas saving of 63% compared to fossil fuels was achieved. This figure excludes emissions from indirect land-use change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;¹ This report contains fuel volume and RTFC data for the whole obligation period, and verified C&amp;amp;S data on renewable fuels supplied for the period after implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive (15 December 2011 to 14 April 2012). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unverified C&amp;amp;S data for renewable fuels supplied for the period 15 April to 14 December 2011 can be found in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/biofuels-statistics"&gt;Biofuels series&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Biofuel statistics: Year 5 (2012/13), report 1</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents statistics on the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for the obligation year 15 April 2012 to 14 July 2012 (Year 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes information on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of UK road transport fuel from renewable and fossil fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) which have been issued to sustainable renewable fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the balance of RTFCs by obligation period;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trades of RTFCs between suppliers and/or traders; and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carbon and sustainability (C&amp;amp;S) characteristics of the renewable fuel supplied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-headline-figures-are"&gt;The headline figures are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6.3 billion litres of renewable transport fuel have been supplied in the 51 months since the RTFO began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="in-the-first-quarter-of-year-5-of-the-rtfo-15-april-2012-to-14-july-2012"&gt;In the first quarter of Year 5 of the RTFO (15 April 2012 to 14 July 2012):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;321 million litres of renewable fuel have been supplied, which is 2.9% of total road transport fuel reported to the RTFO Administrator against an annual obligation of 4.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More bioethanol (60%) has been supplied than biodiesel (36%). There were also small volumes of biogas, biomethanol, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and pure vegetable oil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;154 million RTFCs have been issued of which 69 million were for double counting feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="cs-characteristics-of-the-biofuels-to-which-rtfcs-have-been-issued-37-of-the-total-biofuel185"&gt;C&amp;amp;S characteristics of the biofuels to which RTFCs have been issued (37% of the total biofuel)¹:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The largest proportion of renewable fuel was derived from non-European Community corn (66 million litres, 55% of total biofuel to which RTFCs have been issued). The most widely reported source (by feedstock and country of origin) for biodiesel was used cooking oil from the USA (8 million litres, 31% of biodiesel to which RTFCs have been issued). The most widely sourced bioethanol was corn from the United States of America (65 million litres, 76% of bioethanol to which RTFCs have been issued).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11% of renewable fuel was sourced from UK feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An aggregate greenhouse gas saving of 59% compared to fossil fuels was achieved. This figure excludes emissions from indirect land-use change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;¹ The final deadline for applying for RTFCs is 12 August following the obligation period.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environmental report is a consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revoking the East Midlands Plan and the regional economic strategy (which together form the regional strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report succeeds the previous environmental report for the revocation of the East Midlands Plan which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012.
