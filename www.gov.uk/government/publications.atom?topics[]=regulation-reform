    <title>BIS fifth statement of new regulation: regulations covering January to June 2013</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Informs businesses and interested stakeholders of BIS domestic and EU measures that come into force between January and June 2013.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting red tape and improving our regulation and policies is a key priority for &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;. We aim where appropriate, for a light-touch regulatory environment, with less red tape and burdens on business, whilst protecting the public, consumers and employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="forthcoming-bis-regulation"&gt;Forthcoming &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; Regulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; fifth statement of new regulation shows how &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is removing burdens on business. This is why the domestic regulations coming info force during the period of this statement either reduce costs or place minimal costs on business. The sum total of &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; deregulation over this period is expected to reduce the annual cost to business by around £24.96 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates that regulation is being used as a last resort in the department. Under the ‘One In, Two Out’ rule, &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is in a healthy position, currently in credit. EU legislation is usually out of scope for ‘One In, Two Out’, however for greater transparency the measures are now listed in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;This is published every 6 months to give businesses an indication of when regulations affecting them will be coming into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headline figures show:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are introducing 24 measures in this period, 20 of which are deregulatory measures that will reduce the burden on business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;none of these measures will increase the regulatory burden on businesses, as they are all either deregulatory measures that will bring savings to business, or regulatory measures that have no cost to business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Regulatory Policy Committee have evaluated 5 of our measures and estimated that they will reduce the burden on business by £45.36 million per year. We expect this figure to rise considerably as our other measures are validated.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Call for evidence on the government's review of the balance of competences between the United Kingdom and the European Union</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>This call for evidence is to help inform the government's review of the balance of competences between the EU and the UK.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is carrying out a review of the balance of competences between the EU and the UK. This is an audit of what the EU does and how it affects the UK. You can read more about it on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/european-union/balance-of-competences-review/"&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s web page on the balance of competences review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have published our first &lt;a href="/government-review-of-the-balance-of-competences-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union-call-for-evidence"&gt;Call for Evidence on the Internal Market: Synoptic Review&lt;/a&gt;. The Synoptic report will cover the overall application and effect of the EU Internal Market. The result of the report will be a comprehensive , thorough and detailed analysis of the wider functioning of the Internal Market. It will determine how the so-called “Four Freedoms” operate together to create an efficient and operating Internal Market and ultimately what this means for the UK. We will subsequently be reviewing each of the “Four Freedoms” in turn in semesters 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone wishing to contribute to the review is asked to send their written views before 28 February 2013 to &lt;a href="mailto:balanceofcompetences@bis.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;balanceofcompetences@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; or online at &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/internalmarket"&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/internalmarket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our intention to publish evidence at the end of the review when the reports are published. In the meantime, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills plans to use section 22 to exempt FOI requests around evidence received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
