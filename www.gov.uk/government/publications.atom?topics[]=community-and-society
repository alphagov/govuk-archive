    <summary>Guidance for local authorities and their partners on how to work with troubled families.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a tool to help local authorities and their partners, who have asked for guidance on how best to work with troubled families, and for the evidence about family intervention to be brought together in one place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report looks at academic evidence, local evaluations of practice, what practitioners have told us works in their services and what families tell us makes this work different and successful for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Decentralisation: an assessment of progress</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>A report setting out the progress the government is making to 'decentralise' power from Whitehall across the country.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report by the Rt Hon Greg Clark MP provides an assessment of how 12 government departments are decentralising power and puts forward personal recommendations for next steps. It shows strong progress across all of the domestic policy agenda, but also calls for continued reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report makes the case for decentralisation (sustainable growth, better public services, a stronger society), setting out the gold standard for decentralisation, based on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/decentralisation-and-the-localism-bill-an-essential-guide--2"&gt;guide to decentralisation and the Localism Bill&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in December 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Dealing with illegal and unauthorised encampments: a summary of available powers</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent experience has brought into focus the question of balance between the right to peaceful protest and the disruptive impact of the illegal occupation of land. In addition, the formation of unauthorised campsites by traveller groups can be problematic for the general public and private landowners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On occasion local authorities and their partner agencies have been unclear about the full range of powers available to them to tackle both illegal and unauthorised encampments sites. This summary is intended to be an accessible source of information providing an overview of powers available and to enable the timely reclamation of land and property. This information complements the Department’s Guide to effective use of enforcement powers - Part 1: unauthorised encampments (see below) and is primarily aimed at local authority officials, but it is also intended to be helpful to landowners and others affected by such encampments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Policy statement for part 2 of the Localism Act 2011</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A proposed policy statement to accompany Part 2 of the Localism Act was developed with the Local Government Association and Greater London Authority. The consultation on the proposed statement ended on 22 April 2012. As a result, the policy statement has been revised and is now available in final form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act provides a substantial and lasting shift in power away from central government and towards local people. The government has given public authorities more powers and freedoms to conduct their business and deliver services to the public. This includes a major reduction in the ‘oversight’ role of central government. Public authorities must, therefore, accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions or omissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 2 of the Localism Act is about incentivising public authorities to comply with European law, in order to avoid any financial sanctions in the first place. The policy statement sets out a fair, proportionate and reasonable approach for the use of Part 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 15 December 2010 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government issued a second invitation to local authorities under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007. He invited local authorities to consult people, ask them how they would like to see their local area improved and to take appropriate action to make it happen. The Localism Act has given them far more freedom and flexibility to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If local authorities, having consulted and reached agreement with their local communities, find that a bureaucratic barrier prevents them from taking action, they can submit a formal ‘proposal’ under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 asking Government to remove the barrier through the online portal at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/"&gt;http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; (external link). This portal is also open to anyone who wishes to ask the government to remove a barrier which is stopping local action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation is seeking views on whether the existing arrangements for submitting barrier busting proposals are appropriate or whether town and parish councils should be able to submit proposals using the Sustainable Communities Act as well as local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
