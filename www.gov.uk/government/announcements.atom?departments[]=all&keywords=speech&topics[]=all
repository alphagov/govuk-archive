    <title>Britain and the Commonwealth: Historic Friends, Future Partners</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire gave a speech about the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth at the Royal Commonwealth Society.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Secretary General; High Commissioners; Honourable Members of both Houses; representatives of businesses and NGOs; Welcome to this Commonwealth reception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I must begin by extending my deepest condolences to the people of Samoa who were hit by Cyclone Evan last week. For all those affected – particularly those who lost loved ones – it was a devastating event. Our High Commissioner has conveyed our sympathy to the Samoan Prime Minister. The Cyclone has now also hit Fiji, and our thoughts are with the many Fijians affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is an opportune moment for me to commend the work of the Commonwealth, having had the great privilege of meeting its Head, Her Majesty The Queen, this morning, who came to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on her final Diamond Jubilee year engagement. My short time speaking to her brought to mind the quite extraordinary role she has played for this country and for countries across the Commonwealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On 21 April 1947, her 21st birthday, Her Majesty was with her parents and younger sister, Princess Margaret, on a tour of South Africa. In a speech broadcast on the radio from Cape Town, she said to the people of the Commonwealth: “I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ever since she said those words, her devotion to the Commonwealth has been unwavering. Her Majesty has travelled more than any other monarch in our history. During her reign she has undertaken well over 150 Commonwealth visits, and in 1998 became the first reigning British monarch to undertake State visits to Brunei and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am sure you would all join me this evening, in this historic Diamond Jubilee year, in paying tribute to her work over the past 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So it is a real pleasure to be here this evening, in the run-up to Christmas and Parliamentary recess. I would like to thank Danny Sriskandarajah and Peter Kellner for inviting me to speak, and for their tireless work as Director and Chairman of the Royal Commonwealth Society respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Danny has made a disproportionate contribution to the Society and to the Commonwealth more broadly. The vision he demonstrated in designing and delivering the Commonwealth Conversations project, for example – which was the seed that led to our Eminent Persons Group report – was outstanding. We shall miss his energy, vibrancy and innovation, but wish him well in his new life in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have long been an admirer of the RCS. It is an organisation with deep roots, but one which is constantly evolving. The Society’s role as a promoter of the Commonwealth brand – whether through engaging young people across the world, encouraging public debate on Commonwealth issues, or through spreading awareness of the cultural diversity of its members – is helping to ensure its continued relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And it is on this relevance that I want to focus this evening. Because one can get the sense that for some – British or otherwise – the Commonwealth is an organisation of the past; one which puts on a good sports event every few years, but isn’t in tune with today’s world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to challenge that assertion; to explain why this Government is placing a greater emphasis on the Commonwealth, and what we are trying to do to unlock its true potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-commonwealth-today"&gt;The Commonwealth today&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, set out the Government’s vision for Britain’s foreign policy in July 2010, he spoke of our need to respond to an increasingly networked world. Influence today, he said, “increasingly lies with networks of states with fluid and dynamic patterns of allegiance, alliance and connections”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we are to make the most of the opportunities this creates, and respond to the challenges it represents, we need to make full use of our assets and connections. The Commonwealth, one of the world’s greatest – and oldest – networks, remains one of our most valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was therefore delighted when the Prime Minister appointed me as Minister responsible for the Commonwealth – an organisation I have respected for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Both the Foreign Secretary and my much-admired predecessor, Lord Howell – who Frank Field described in a debate last week as a “jewel in the crown” of Commonwealth interest – have together put the “C” back into the “FCO”: the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am a firm believer in the value the Commonwealth adds on the international stage – politically, economically and culturally. So let me first outline what I think are its greatest strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First and foremost is its sheer scale. Its members account for a third of the world’s population, more than a fifth of the Earth’s total land area and have a combined GDP of over £6 trillion. As a whole, it is an organisation with real clout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is a hugely diverse grouping – bringing together different people, united by our shared language, legal systems and values. From the plains of southern Africa to the island nations of the Pacific, the Commonwealth gives all of its members an equal seat at the international table. It can amplify their voices and make sure the views of even the smallest nations are heard by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the Commonwealth provides tangible support very effectively. A few examples spring immediately to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One is election observation. The Commonwealth has observed over 70 elections since 1990, including recent missions to Ghana and Sierra Leone. On each occasion they have provided a trusted, objective judgement on the credibility of the process, the environment in which the elections took place and the final result. But the observation missions don’t just observe: they also submit recommendations, drawing on collective expertise, on how to improve elections in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would also point to the Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships Programme, through which Commonwealth governments offer scholarships and fellowships to citizens from other member countries. Since it was established 53 years ago, 27,000 people have benefitted – including, as a topical example, Mark Carney, the next Governor of the Bank of England. In Britain, we have supported the scheme to the tune of £87 million for the four years from 2011 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Another practical example is technical assistance to promote development in member states, which I know is a very important element of Commonwealth membership for some countries. The Secretariat’s assistance on good governance and the rule of law is helping to build the solid democratic foundations required for sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And I would add to all of this a fourth – and significant – strength: that the Commonwealth is not just about government contacts. Looking around this hall, I can see representatives from a huge range of backgrounds – parliamentarians, businesses, NGOs, civil society, young people. It is these groups that make the Commonwealth so effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-the-commonwealth-is-changing"&gt;How the Commonwealth is changing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Commonwealth of today is a dynamic, diverse grouping – one of the world’s leading soft power networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But it is not standing still. Like any organisation, the Commonwealth isn’t perfect. All of its members, the United Kingdom included, recognise that to maintain its relevance, the Commonwealth needs to respond to shifting global trends and the rising expectations of its citizens – particularly its younger ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the driving force behind the agenda to modernise the Commonwealth, which has been in train since last year’s Heads of Government meeting in Perth. We have all been working hard on this and have made good progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just this week the Secretary-General confirmed that, following discussions in September by Commonwealth Foreign Ministers, the majority of the reform measures proposed by the Eminent Persons Group have been agreed by Heads of Government. That is good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now that we have agreement on the way ahead, we need to make it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Key among the reform measures is the agreement to have a Commonwealth Charter to set out, in a single document, the Commonwealth’s core values. It is important that we now work collectively to raise the Charter’s profile, across the Commonwealth, to embed it within the architecture that ensures members uphold these values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Government will, with your help, work to raise the profile of the Charter here in Britain, with a focus on Parliament, civil society and youth organisations. I know the RCS has made its own contribution to this by hosting events on the Charter for civil society organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just as important is the strengthening of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, which should enable the organisation to respond more quickly to infringements of Commonwealth values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As the swift response of the Action Group to the situation in the Maldives has shown, we are already starting to see the benefits of these changes. Through this and other country engagements the Action Group works on, it must demonstrate that it is living up to its strengthened mandate and can make a real difference on the world stage. This will make a significant contribution to the credibility of the Commonwealth as an international organisation that adds value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-soft-power-network-of-the-future"&gt;The soft power network of the future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An increased focus on the Commonwealth has been a key element of this Government’s re-alignment of Britain’s foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In part, this has involved practical steps like the strengthening of our diplomatic network in Commonwealth countries. We opened a new Deputy High Commission in Hyderabad in India in May, with another in Chandigarh to follow soon. We are also strengthening our commercial capacity in Commonwealth countries like Canada, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Guyana. And here in London we have increased the number of staff working on the Commonwealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But our renewed focus has also involved a change in approach; a change in the way we work, by seeking to make the most of our Commonwealth contacts. When William Hague visited Australia last year it was the first visit by a British Foreign Secretary for 17 years. In the past twelve months, Foreign and Commonwealth Office Ministers have visited around 20 Commonwealth countries – including my recent visit to Belize and, just last week, to Brunei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All of this has left us in a strong position to build on the progress we have already made on our Commonwealth agenda. This is important, because there is much work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Trade and investment is a prime example: we should be pushing to increase the volume of trade among Commonwealth members, and – connected to this – working to increase prosperity across the network by creating the conditions that allow trade to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Intra-Commonwealth trade already amounts to around £250 billion each year.  But we should be much more ambitious, as the potential is vast. The Commonwealth’s middle class has expanded by one billion people in the last 20 years. These new consumers represent a significant and rapidly growing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We can add to this the Commonwealth’s in-built advantages. Research conducted by this Society two years ago found that when two trading partners were Commonwealth members, their trade was likely to be a third to a half more than when one or both trade partners was non-Commonwealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This ‘Commonwealth effect’ – explained in terms of shared history, values, legal systems and language – should enable us to drive trade to even greater heights. Just look at sub-Saharan Africa, for example: the latest World Bank rankings show that all but four of the top 20 countries in which to do business there are Commonwealth members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But this agenda certainly isn’t just about business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We also need to ensure that the Commonwealth stands up for its values and beliefs; that it identifies where its values are not being adhered to; and that it speaks up to turn things around when this happens. The strengthened Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, for which the Secretary-General has committed to provide additional Secretariat resources, has a critical role here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So too does the Commonwealth Games. The 2014 Games in Glasgow – the Commonwealth’s own Olympics – are as much about promoting Commonwealth values, a key element of its brand, as they are about building prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We also need to develop the Commonwealth’s advocacy role to ensure the voices of its members are heard in international negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And we need to increase the Commonwealth’s engagement with Britain’s Overseas Territories, which share many of the challenges facing small Commonwealth states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Commonwealth Secretariat’s new Strategic Plan for 2013 to 2016 should help us to address these issues. We are working with the Secretariat to ensure its focus is in areas where it has a comparative advantage, to avoid duplicating the work of other international organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Next year will offer several opportunities to drive this work forward. This includes the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Colombo. Ahead of the meeting, we will of course look to Sri Lanka – as we would to any Host – to demonstrate its commitment to upholding the Commonwealth values of good governance and respect for human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And I look forward to the Commonwealth Week in March which will offer another opportunity to showcase the organisation’s work. Next year’s theme – ‘Opportunity Through Enterprise’ – is particularly relevant at this time of global economic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Commonwealth today is as important as it has ever been. Its members represent some of the most fast-growing, dynamic economies in the world. They are political, social and cultural leaders on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With such collective weight, we shouldn’t be surprised that some – including, recently, the British Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Select Committee – think it is an organisation that should do better. They are right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Each and every one of us in this room wants a strong Commonwealth; one which makes the most of its considerable assets. I hope I have made clear this afternoon that it already does a lot of things well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we continue to drive forward the reform process, I am confident that we can build an even more successful Commonwealth – one which does less so it can do it better, focusing on those areas in which it adds the most value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These will include strengthening governance and democracy; increasing the resilience of small and vulnerable states; creating more effective frameworks for inclusive economic growth and sustainable development; ensuring members are able to participate in the global trading system; and improving climate financing frameworks for vulnerable states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And for those that still need convincing of the Commonwealth’s relevance in today’s world, I would say this: if it was not important, if it did not play an influential role on the international stage, countries would not be queuing up to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That this is exactly what is happening at the moment is testament to the continued relevance of the Commonwealth today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wish you all a very happy Christmas and a peaceful New Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The Foreign Office, one of the great offices of state.</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>The Foreign Secretary gave a speech on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as part of the Speaker's lecture series on great offices of state.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Speaker’s Lecture Series was launched in January 2011 by the Speaker of the House of Commons with the aim to provide a platform which encourages understanding of, and engagement with, the work of Parliament and its Parliamentarians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary William Hague gave his speech on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office yesterday, he said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is an honour to give this lecture. I am grateful to the Speaker for his invitation, and to you all for coming to listen to me. It comes at the end of a very memorable day in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. We have just hosted Her Majesty the Queen for the last event of her Diamond Jubilee, and have named in her honour and in perpetuity 437,000 square kilometres of the British Antarctic Territories as ‘Queen Elizabeth Land’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our country benefits enormously from the stability of its institutions, of which the monarchy is a preeminent example. And in my view every Foreign Secretary should consider it to be a central part of his or her responsibility to build up the capabilities and skills of the Foreign Office; because it strengthens our democracy and our country’s role in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has a special allure as an institution.  It represents a restless and ambitious streak in the British character: an outward-looking and energetic strand in our national DNA that makes us hungry for success for Britain, concerned about poverty and injustice, and keen to be a positive force in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Historically the Foreign Office is associated with many defining events in our nation’s history: with wars, conquest and the waxing and waning of Empire; with Great Power rivalry and intrigue; with competition for trade, territory and resources, with Treaties and the drawing of borders in distant lands, and with the defence of our freedom in two World Wars and the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Indeed, I believe it is not possible to conduct foreign policy effectively without constant reference to our own history and the history of other nations. On my last visit to Kabul this year President Karzai and I discussed the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the site of so many of the region’s difficulties today. The President asked me if Britain still had the original Treaty of 1893 between Sir Mortimer Durand and the Afghan leader Amir Khan, which literally drew a line between the two countries and which he had never seen. I put this question to the Foreign Office historians on my return to London. They located the Treaty, the map of the Durand line and the public proclamation to the Afghan people that accompanied it. And more than a century after the agreement was signed, British diplomats presented copies to President Karzai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have a sense of conjoined history with many countries. I gather that a recent book ‘All the Countries We’ve Ever Invaded: and the Few we Never Got Round to’ asserts that Britain has in some way invaded all but twenty-two countries in the world over time. If this is true, it is not entirely comfortable reading.  Yet I believe that our history as a nation of trade, culture and science has infused in us an openness towards other nations, and an abiding sense of our international responsibilities.
It is intriguing that during the period of the greatest expansion of British diplomatic and military power overseas, the Foreign Office either barely existed at all as an institution or was in the early stages of its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A professional bureaucracy devoted to our nation’s foreign policy developed extremely slowly. Today’s Foreign Office was arguably 700 years in the making, between 1253 when we find the first record of a ‘King’s Secretary’ for foreign affairs, and 1968 when the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Office were merged to form the Department I lead today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our network of Embassies and High Commissions is also more than 500 years old, from the appointment of the first British Ambassador to Rome in 1479 to our network of over 260 posts today. By the time of Elizabeth I resident Ambassadors had also been appointed to the Ottoman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire, the Venetian Republic and the Kingdom of France as well as to Rome. But by the late 1860s, nearly four hundred years after that first Ambassadorial appointment, there were still only five British Embassies and 19 legations overseas run from London. There were of course many more resident representatives in Asia and the Middle East who reported back to the India Office through Calcutta and later Delhi. But the big expansion of Britain’s diplomatic network did not come until after the Second World War. Today the number of British diplomatic posts overseas is once more on the rise, and by 2015 we will have up to 20 new Embassies, consulates and trade offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like our Embassy network, our foreign policy bureaucracy also evolved slowly. From 1640 there were two ‘Principal Secretaries’ or Ministers with joint responsibility for home and foreign affairs; an arrangement that lasted for 140 years. Their foreign domains were divided between the ‘Northern Department’, covering the Holy Roman Empire, Holland, Scandinavia, Poland and Russia; and the ‘Southern Department’ encompassing France, the other Latin Countries and the Ottoman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There was no single Secretary of State responsible for Foreign Affairs until 1782, when the Northern and Southern Departments were amalgamated and the ‘Foreign Office’ came into being under the first Foreign Secretary Charles James Fox. Even then the foreign policy machinery available to him was tiny. The budget of Fox’s Foreign Office was £14,178. In practice it was much less than that, since more than a third of that was his own salary – no longer the case in the Foreign Office today. And it had a grand total of eleven staff: seven clerks, one chief clerk, two Under Secretaries – including the colourful MP and playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Fox’s friend - and one female employee known as the “necessary woman”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This title reflected the lowly status of women in the Foreign Office, a sad state of affairs which largely continued until after the Second World War.  In accounts of the 18th and 19th century Foreign Office we find stray and usually denigrating references to female staff, such as to “the energetic little housemaid” who saved irreplaceable treaties by dousing a fire in the Library in 1839. It seems staggering now, but women were permitted to do only the most basic administrative tasks in the Foreign Office until 1946; and until 1972 female diplomats were actually required to resign if they got married. Britain’s first female Head of Mission was appointed only in 1973. We now have 37 female Heads of Mission, four times as many as fifteen years ago. But the number is still far too small and I am determined to increase it during my tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 1860, after more than 70 years of its existence, the Foreign Office still had only sixty staff, although the nature of the work had begun to change. Officials now advised Ministers on the formulation of policy, when before their work had been almost exclusively administrative. A whiff of those earlier days is conjured up by the references to the “prison allowance”, a daily bread roll provided to staff in the mid-1800s – presumably by the “necessary woman”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for the slow development of Britain’s foreign policy machinery was of course the historical role of our monarchy. Although the Crown’s direct control over policy diminished from the mid-18th century, foreign policy was still open to a strong degree of Royal influence well into the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we think that diplomats sometimes get a bad press today, spare a thought for those Queen Victoria had in mind when, as the Government considered whether or not to establish an Embassy in Italy after unification, her Private Secretary relayed that “Her Majesty is much opposed to any increase in Embassies; indeed her Majesty thinks that the time for Ambassadors and their pretensions is past” – and that was in the 1800s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can also picture how it must have added to the woes of Gladstone’s administration, after General Gordon and his troops had been massacred at Khartoum in a shocking failure of British foreign policy, that Queen Victoria sent a strongly-worded telegram of disapproval to the Government, saying “to think that all this might have been prevented and many precious lives saved by earlier action is too frightful”.  However justified, the criticism appeared to have been deliberately sent in un-coded form – and was therefore instantly “leaked” and devoured by the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The slow growth of the Foreign Office was also a product of the gradual evolution of ‘Whitehall’ itself. When my hero William Pitt the Younger became Prime Minister in 1783 he had no dedicated officials whatsoever. At the time whole government budgets were paid directly into the accounts of government ‘paymasters’ – the Ministers that is - leaving them free to invest the balances of public money for their own account , leading to expenses scandals dwarfing anything seen in modern times. And it was also entirely at the discretion of Ministers to employ members of staff, who were often friends and relatives, and to decide their pay and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But Pitt’s premiership proved to be a turning point in the history of the British state. Robert Walpole is generally credited with being the first Prime Minister, partly due to his exceptionally long tenure of more than 20 years. However it was Pitt, who served for 19 years in total, who can be said to have created the modern job of Prime Minister through his use of the central power of the Treasury and his activism as a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lord North, who preceded Pitt, is often referred to as a ‘Tory Prime Minister’. In actual fact he frequently denied he was either a Tory or the Prime Minister. His daughter revealed that “he would never allow us to call him Prime Minister, saying that there was no such thing in the British constitution”. He would not always accept responsibility for other Ministers, did not drive forward their work, and many of them would have maintained their own relationship with the King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pitt was the first head of a British Government to direct government from the centre. He intervened in the business of other Ministries at times of crisis. He strengthened the coordination between them, elevated the role of the Treasury, created a simpler and more sustainable basis for the nation’s finances, instituted the first income tax, and ended much of the corruption in government. This centralising tendency was not without its critics. Lord Grenville, his Foreign Secretary, described Pitt’s second term in office as “a government of one man alone”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However Pitt’s achievements demonstrate that the government departments require either strong leadership or the development of active institutions around them if they are to be effective. Ideally they require both of these attributes at the same time. This is reflected in the experience of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 19th century produced some of the most powerful personalities ever to occupy the office of Foreign Secretary. George Canning held the post between 1807 and 1809, and again between 1822 and 1827. He is best known for giving Britain’s support to the independence movements in central and southern America – calling a New World into existence, as he put it, to redress the balance of the Old. This opened the door to an explosion of trade and commerce, in a spirit which we are attempting to reignite today by opening new British Embassies and consulates in Latin America for the first time in decades. Canning’s sad and truncated stint as Prime Minister in 1827 attracted fewer plaudits. His contemporary Sydney Smith said it was like seeing a fly in amber: “nobody cares about the fly…The only question is, how the devil did it get there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Viscount Castlereagh was a towering figure as Foreign Secretary, and Canning’s bitter rival. They fought an extraordinary duel in 1809 when they were Foreign and War Secretaries respectively. Canning came off worse, perhaps because he had never fired a shot before. He retired from the field with a bullet through his thigh, although they both had to resign from the Government. This remains - for the time being at least - the last time in British history that Ministers have sought to settle a political argument in this way, although it is sometimes tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Castlereagh presided over the redrawing of the map of Europe at the Congress of Vienna in 1814 after a quarter of a century of war. This was the first time a serving British Foreign Secretary had travelled overseas in the thirty years that the job had existed. This was not surprising at the time. Pitt only left Britain once in his entire life – travelling to France, and taking tea with Marie Antoinette - yet as Prime Minister he disposed of huge forces and pursued alliances and treaties around the globe. This is hard to imagine now when it is not unusual for a Foreign Secretary to visit four or five countries in as many days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most memorable account of the Congress of Vienna came from the pen of historian and philosopher Egon Friedell. He wrote “the Tsar of Russia falls in love for everyone; the King of Prussia thinks for everyone, the King of Denmark speaks for everyone; the King of Bavaria drinks for everyone; the King of Württemberg eats for everyone … and the Emperor of Austria pays for everyone.” I leave you to draw your own parallels with European Councils today. The last word went to Napoleon, who delivered what he intended as a stinging Gallic retort, but which Britain might consider as a compliment: “Castlereagh had the Continent at his mercy…and he made peace as if he had been defeated. The imbecile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, Castlereagh also persuaded the Congress of Vienna to make a commitment to the abolition of the slave trade, to put an end, as he said, “to a scourge which so long desolated Africa, degraded Europe, and afflicted humanity”. This can be considered to be the first human rights declaration in an international Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would also mention Viscount Palmerston, who stands out for helping to stamp out the Atlantic slave trade, and for his aphorisms which have proved remarkably enduring. It was he who said that “it was a British interest to preserve the balance of power in international affairs”; “that Britain had no permanent friends or permanent enemies”; and that “the furtherance of British interests should be the only object of a British Foreign Secretary”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 19th century was also the period when the Foreign Office’s core functions as we define them today –protecting British nationals, supporting our economy, protecting our security and promoting human rights – took on an institutional basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Foreign Office’s Consular Department came into being more than 200 years ago, with responsibilities formalised through the Consular Act of 1825. And its first commercial attaché was appointed in the 1880s. Today, we have more than 800 ‘prosperity officers’ in our Embassies overseas, all of whom can trace their work back to that beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some people might find it surprising that the Foreign Office’s human rights work also has its roots in this era. In 1824 the Slave Trade Department was set up to mount Britain’s crusade to end the trafficking of slaves by other countries, when the Foreign Office was only forty years old. Many saw this moral cause as an act of reparation for the sins of the past, since Britain had shipped as many as 2.8 million slaves from Africa to the Americas by 1807, when Britain formally abolished the slave trade. This became the defining human rights issue – as we would now think if it - of the 19th century, and for several decades the Slave Trade Department was the largest department in the Foreign Office. It led to efforts to agree a framework of international law for the seizing of slave vessels, and the use of Britain’s military power to suppress human rights abuses. You could call this Britain’s earliest humanitarian intervention, and out of it all of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s human rights work can be said to have grown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The oldest Foreign Office Department was the Librarians Department, established by Lord Granville in 1801. In my view this reflects an absolutely fundamental principle: a strong institution must retain and use knowledge and information as well as it nurtures its people. The historic Foreign Office Library was dismantled in 2007 and sadly we cannot recreate it. But our historians are now using the old Home Office Library in our main building as the home for their wonderful books, and our lawyers are using the old Library for theirs. And I am glad to say that we are once again placing proper emphasis on the contribution of historians to the making of foreign policy. Indeed, I am indebted to them and to their predecessors for some of the insights in this speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So the Foreign and Commonwealth Office rests on foundations that are as old as modern Britain, and it is one of our greatest assets as a nation. And to my mind, when a country has built up a vital institution in this way over centuries, we have a responsibility to strengthen its skills and capabilities all the time and to use it properly within government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Democracy requires thriving institutions: in civil society to encourage participation and keep in check an over-mighty State; in our legal system and parliament to ensure that the law is upheld and the making of it respected; and within Government so that the public interest is properly served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The power and role of a Government Department depends very much on how it is used and developed by its incumbent, and is constantly shifting. Indeed it is the nature of politics and government that any institution that is not developing and advancing will in fact be retreating and shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the case of foreign policy, the strength of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has a direct bearing on our standing and influence in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If it is teeming with people who speak foreign languages, who have deep regional knowledge and cutting edge diplomatic skills and they can be deployed anywhere in the world then we have a competitive advantage in world affairs. If we allow those capabilities to wither and our diplomacy to shrink, then our interests suffer and our role is diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is no secret that I believe that in recent decades the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was weakened, and that it was wrong for so many Embassies to be closed. I am not alone in this view, which has been expressed across political parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So one of my objectives from my very first day as Foreign Secretary has been to ensure that the Foreign Office of the future is stronger than the one I inherited, and that my successors of whatever political party will be able to develop it further. Given the Foreign Secretary’s responsibility for two of our intelligence agencies, this must also include the Secret Intelligence Service and GCHQ being strong institutions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There were a number of immediate things that I believed needed to be put right when I became Foreign Secretary. This included restoring the Department’s finances to a sustainable footing, increasing the emphasis on diplomatic skills, placing more emphasis on supporting our economy and making the decision to expand Britain’s diplomatic network.  I am very grateful for the enthusiastic and professional way the men and women of the Foreign Office have responded to this change of direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But our task in the Foreign Office is even bigger than that. We are preparing for a world that will change dramatically, to help ensure that whatever lies ahead Britain can compete economically, remain secure, and contribute to peace and security for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Long term predictions are usually wrong. But looking thirty years ahead, we do know that there will have been a dramatic shift in economic power and influence to countries in the South and East of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We know that we will have to earn our living in a far tougher global marketplace, with our young people competing against millions of highly-educated graduates in some of the fastest-growing economies and most vibrant societies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We can expect it to be a more volatile global economy, in which we will have to work harder to seek out economic opportunity for our citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And we can anticipate more Arab Spring style situations, in countries where political reform does not keep pace with economic development or social expectations, where inequalities deepen, or where resources are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On top of this we will face huge international problems including climate change, preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, and limiting the risks of cyber crime and cyber attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To tackle these, we will need to work more closely with countries which are not our traditional allies and do not necessarily share all of our values. This will invariably produce strains on issues like human rights and freedom, since we will always stand up for universal values. We will have to get used to more ambiguity in our foreign relations, in which we work closely with some countries on particular issues, but diverge with them significantly on others. We are accustomed to this in our dealings with Russia and China already, but it will become a wider trend, and will call for skilful and principled diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And we will also need to remain a global nation - indeed probably an even more global one than we are today, in terms of our economic interests, our security, and the needs of British people overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So I believe that the need for the Foreign Office as a means of understanding and influencing other countries and protecting our interests is greater than it ever has been in our history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And moreover I believe that the Foreign Ministries that will be best able to cope with the more uncertain world that lies ahead will be those that have flexibility, agility, and resilience hard-wired into their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have not reached the end of history as was predicted in the 1990s, or the end of foreign policy. Nor have we reached a simpler period of a world divided into static blocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ours is a multi-polar world in which countries are meshed together by lattices of connections at every level: with powerful links between individuals, businesses, parliaments and civil society as well as between governments; ranging from the tangible such as physical infrastructure, to virtual links and the power of ideas. It is a far more complex international landscape, in which we need diplomacy to help understand the cultures and interests of other nations and to build partnerships with them. And it is a world in which power is diffusing away from governments towards citizens in many ways, requiring new forms of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this world Britain’s interest lies in making the most of every network of which we are a part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The European Union, with its great advantages as a single market and collective force in foreign, trade and environmental policy;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NATO, that has the ability form successful partnerships with countries outside its membership, and to play a growing role in our security;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UN, in which we play an important role as a permanent member of the Security Council;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And the Commonwealth, which contains more than 30% of the world’s population and six of the world’s fastest-growing economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On top of this we have to develop ever stronger relationships beyond Europe and America; in Asia, Africa and the Gulf, ensuring that ours is a country that is advancing not shrinking, and looking at the world with optimism not fear of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Foreign Office has to have all the best qualities of a network itself, in six principal ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First, it has to be a centre of excellence and ideas, not an island of administration. This includes being plugged into other networks across government, throughout our society and around the world, so that the best ideas circulate through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is an overlooked truth that the Foreign Office’s influence in British government does not rest on personalities or the size of its budget, but on the power of its ideas and its skill in executing them. The creation of the National Security Council means that today foreign policy runs through the veins of the whole of Government in a way that it never has done before, which is vital given that many other Government Departments play a role in our foreign relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Second, we need to be able to attract and develop highly talented British and locally-engaged staff, and to retain close links to the expertise of our alumni even when they have left. We have now begun to do in a systematic way, since this is an attribute of any strong institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Third, the Foreign Office has to be good at every single part of its necessary functions so that the overall effect is one of excellence. No athlete succeeded in the London Olympic Games who did not attend to every single part of his or her performance, and institutions thrive on the same principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fourth, our Foreign Office has to place a proper emphasis on geographic expertise and languages; the things that enable our diplomats to get under the skin of other countries. So we have increased funding for language training by 30%, have 40% more speakers of Arabic and Mandarin in our Posts overseas than only two years ago, and are building a new language centre in the heart of the Foreign Office that will have up to 30 classrooms and train 1,000 students a year, and we are also training more of our diplomats in commercial and economic skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fifth, our diplomats should use the best of modern technology, so that we communicate with people as well as governments and do so as transparently as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sixth, in all that it does the Foreign Office has to be agile and adaptable, and capable of responding rapidly to a changing environment with what I call expeditionary diplomacy: the ability to be able to spot problems and opportunities and use diplomacy to respond to both in creative ways. In a world in which networks defeat hierarchies, the organisations that will thrive best are those that are flexible not rigid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now that we are building up this capability, we have to be ambitious about how we use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is unrivalled in its ability to react to crises and to operate highly effectively at the UN, as we saw during the Libya crisis. We will need this capability again and again to respond to the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But we are also one of the few countries in the world with the combination of a global diplomatic network, military capability and international influence that means that we can actually try to resolve intractable conflicts and address vast global issues; to be proactive, not reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our Government is determined to retain a high level of ambition for what Britain can do in the world. Yes we want the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to be a Rolls Royce of a Government Department. But we should not be afraid to take that Rolls Royce out and to race it around the odd corner on two wheels when necessary, even if that means risking the occasional dent and scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That is why Britain is leading the way in developing and sharing capabilities to protect our economy against threats in cyberspace, and to secure a future for the internet that is open and free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is why we have launched a major new initiative on preventing sexual violence in conflict, taking an international problem that is generally regarded to be insurmountable, and proposing ways that we can reduce and one day hopefully end the use of rape as a weapon of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And we have set out to make a fundamental difference to the situation in Somalia, using our ability to mount complex diplomatic and security efforts involving many nations. We brought 50 countries together for a conference in London this year, secured a UN Security Council Resolution and new action on piracy and persuaded Somalia’s leaders to make political progress on the ground, all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As these examples show, the modern Foreign Secretary has to define the national interest far more broadly than Palmerston ever did. We cannot define our national interest narrowly or selfishly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today what I call our enlightened national interest includes counter-proliferation anywhere in the world; counter-terrorism in most parts of the world; climate change being addressed; and human rights being upheld and expanded. The Foreign Office’s ability to meet these demands on it rests not only on political leadership but on its development as a strong institution and centre of excellence. In fact any country that does not succeed in ensuring that its Foreign Ministry is a Great Office of State that can navigate the networked world will not be able to defend their national interest effectively over the next 20 to 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That is why I am determined to strengthen the foundations of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, so it will be able to defend Britain’s national interest and contribute to a peaceful, stable and more just world long into the future. I hope people of all parties will support this work, that the changes we have in hand will become irreversible, and that future governments will value and use the Foreign Office properly. I do so confident that a strong Foreign Office matters to our country and will support future British Governments of whatever complexion. This can only be good for the British people, and good for Britain’s role in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards speech to the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), 17 December 2012</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you Lord Hutton for your kind introduction.  It is good to see so many friends and colleagues here and may I take the opportunity to thank you all for your strong support to the Armed Forces.  It is hugely appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am feeling slightly cautious this evening.  Our senior Defence Attaché in the Americas tells me that in the Aztec calendar today is the Day of the Lizard.  They say:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘The warrior must be like the lizard, who is not hurt by a high fall but, instead, immediately climbs back to its perch.  These are good days to keep out of sight; bad days to attract attention.’&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So perhaps today isn’t the best time to be standing before you!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In honouring my commitment to this august organisation that plays such an important role in the life of UK Defence, I want to take the opportunity to examine where we are today, what deductions we should draw, and what we are doing to ensure we are prepared for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are all aware of how much change there has been over the past two years.  We have begun to introduce the SDSR, balanced the books and turned a corner in Afghanistan.  Yet much of the world seems less stable and more dangerous than was the case even two years ago; a harsh world in which intra-state conflict can be confused by and for new forms of inter-state conflict.  A world in which governance vacuums present opportunities for extremist groups to perpetrate large-scale violence and disruption, especially as precision-strike capabilities, cyber instruments and bio terror weaponry become inevitably more accessible.  And this in a period when economic fragility makes us both more vulnerable and less able to respond in a confident and timely manner, a reality aggravated by the huge cost differentials between western forces and non-state opponents. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this is demanding much from all of us and is changing the shape and capabilities of the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together with my fellow Chiefs I have been examining, as you would expect, how we should best use what we have and what we need for the future.  We have to be hard-nosed realists; accepting we have less than we would wish but that we are still required to protect this nation’s interests through the projection of military force.  We cannot shrug our shoulders and hope the problem will go away.  We have to be ready to fight and fight effectively, often not on our own terms and accepting the constraints we are under.  I have brought this together in a piece of work I will be sharing in the future called How We Will Fight.  And I will look at some of its key deductions in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should be under no illusions; the Armed Forces of tomorrow, like those of today, will be engaged in operations around the world.  They will require the best of their generation as they always have.  People who can think flexibly and with imagination.  As Einstein said, “imagination is more important than knowledge”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These operations will not be carbon copies of Afghanistan or Libya.  But they will require the same skill and dedication that these operations, and all the others we have engaged in since the Cold War, have demanded.  They will require the strength and indeed guile that our Army, Navy and Air Force are famous for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on the battle-winning reputation, proven resilience and technological edge of the past decade, I hope you won’t notice some of the tasks the Armed Forces will be doing.  They will be performing a key part of our developing military strategy – deterrence.  Preventing conflict, you may recall, is rightly a principal task of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will come back to this theme later but it is worth remembering that your Armed Forces are often most effective when they are not in the headlines.  Few operations, exercises or training missions are widely reported but each one communicates that we are strong, credible and reliable.  This deters our enemies and reassures our friends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we should be proud of our nation’s record in this respect.  The relative peace we have enjoyed here in the UK for the past 70 years is not an accident.  It is in large part the result of the quiet work of diplomats building friendships, the skill of our financiers and businessmen in making our economy strong, and the courage of our Armed Forces in deterring and when necessary overcoming threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Afghanistan is an example of this lesson.  With our partners in NATO/ISAF and the ANSF we have been more successful than many, regrettably, recognise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have recently returned from a visit there and, I can tell you, we are meeting the tasks laid on us.  Over the past decade we have:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a.	closed Al Qaeda’s bolthole ;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b.	helped underpin a more stable government;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;c.	overseen elections;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;d.	trained an Army and police force;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;e.	and put a country that suffered 30-years of war into a position where industry, education and the rule of law are beginning to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;True, there is a long way to go.  The presidential elections in 2014 will be hugely important.  But we are heading in the right direction and we have proved what can be done with the right resources and with the right support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I look forward to 2013 seeing us increasingly transition to an Afghan lead as we move from mentoring battalions to supporting brigades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Afghan Army now enjoys the support and trust of 84 percent of the country, only 3 percent less than the British Army in this country.  That is a fantastic achievement, by them and ISAF.  It recognises the integral part they are playing in turning the destiny of a country away from violence and onto a path of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am proud of what our Service men and women have achieved in Afghanistan.  Alongside partners in DFID and the Foreign Office we have given Afghans a chance they couldn’t have dreamt of only a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our operation in Afghanistan does not stand alone.  It is linked to Pakistan and India and the wider region.  In my recent trip to Islamabad, a city I have got to know well, I was very encouraged by the helpful attitude of civilian and military leaders to reconciling the Taliban.  The Taliban, like us, are focussed on Afghanistan’s presidential poll and the end of our combat operations in 2014.  They know that the window of opportunity to play a role in their country’s future is closing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every day the Afghan Army and Police grow in capability and legitimacy.  Every day the government is better able to serve its people and thus better able to marginalise the Taliban.  Now, surely, the time is ripe to take risk in order to find that elusive political solution 10 years of military effort and sacrifice has sought to create the conditions for?  But in order to pull this off, it is vital that Afghan confidence in the West’s long-term commitment to their country is retained.  Why, should this be lost, would they stay the course themselves let alone fight to protect us in 2014 when, absent successful reconciliation, we will be at our most vulnerable?  And why should the Taliban reconcile, if they thought we were ‘cutting and running’?  Retaining Afghan confidence is the campaign’s centre of gravity.  And for the UK, retaining our influence and status within NATO and amongst key allies, is another reason for getting this right.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While achieving our goals in Afghanistan, British Armed Forces have been active elsewhere around the world.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Libya we fought in support of a people who wanted to be free from tyranny.  We joined allies from around the world built around a NATO core.  Together, we supplied the air force and the navy.  The people themselves were the army.  They made the change happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the seas off Somalia we are playing our part in an operation that is controlling the spread of piracy.  Alongside navies from around the world, including Pakistan, India and China, reinforcing the benefit of cooperation.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closer to home we have also been proud to play our part in HM the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations.  And my fellow Chiefs and I were delighted to receive so many letters of support for the actions of our Regular and Reserve Service men and women during the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It reminded all of us in uniform of the level of support that we enjoy amongst the people of this country.  We are very grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this has happened as we have been going through reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past two years we have implemented some of the most radical changes to the Ministry of Defence and to the Armed Forces in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SDSR shrank the size of the Armed Forces and changed the governance of the department.  And whilst we are aware that the Autumn Statement has further implications, a balanced budget means we can start from a firm base and better demonstrate what is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new Armed Forces Committee mandates the Chiefs to resolve problems in the interests of Defence as a whole.  It exploits collective military judgment and balances single service requirements in private allowing the CDS to go to the Defence Board with the underpinning authority of a combined Joint service view.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFC, the Defence Strategy Group chaired jointly by John Thomson the PUS and me, and the new style Defence Board chaired by Philip Hammond enable the MOD to be more agile and decisive in responding at the strategic level to developing threats and trends.  The world is not a safe place.  Some threats to our interests and allies are long term but some are very present.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The immediate danger of the collapse of the Syrian regime is one.  We will support our allies in the region and would all like to see a diplomatic solution but cannot afford to remove options from the table at this stage.  Should chemical weapons be used or proliferate, both President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron have made it clear that a line would have been crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Syria is linked to Iran.  The regime is backed by Tehran so the fall of Assad’s dictatorship will impact the Iranian government.  What that means for the stability of the region is as yet unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my recent trip to the Manama Dialogue I was struck by the issues that came up.  Our host, Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain, emphasised the threat of nuclear proliferation.  North Korea’s missile test last week aggravates this risk. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kenyan and Ugandan armed forces have been exemplary in bringing order to Somalia but this has not been without cost.  Both have sustained losses, and the retaliation of terrorist groups has endangered Kampala, Nairobi and the Kenyan coast.  We must continue to support both countries, as well as the fledgling Somali government. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the west, Mali is a major cause for concern.  As still is Yemen, despite President Hadi’s laudable efforts. 
So What?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now reducing these short and long term threats, our task is to evolve a force capable of meeting, with allies, various complex tasks.  By the early 2020s, these plans result in a powerful Joint force that, on the basis of a balanced budget from Planning Round 12, should be able to meet the requirements laid on it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has not been easy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the Secretary of State, building on the work of the SDSR, has ensured that the department is able to squeeze the most from the resources available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 2020 we will have kit that many of my fellow NATO Chiefs of Defence, saddled with much more sclerotic budgets than we, are envious of:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a.	A World Class Carrier Capability with the JSF – Lightning II – on board;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b.	Type 45 destroyers on patrol;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;c.	Type 26 frigates in production;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;d.	Astute class submarines;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;e.	Chinook Mk 6 bringing the total Chinook fleet to 60;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;f.	Typhoon Tranche 3, as well as the Lightning II;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;g.	Atlas and Voyager air transport and air-to-air refuelling aircraft, underpinned by our now larger C17 fleet;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;h.	Scout vehicles, upgraded Warrior, Challenger, and Apache to give the Army better reconnaissance, mobility and firepower;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i.	Rivet Joint and other critical ISTAR platforms that will ensure we have better situational awareness than ever.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;j.	And much more emphasis on Cyber, to which I will return shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But our most decisive asset will remain our Service men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the private sector puts it, we must look after the ‘talent’. As I see equipment around the world parked with no-one to operate it. Great equipment without talented people counts for little.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We must ensure our people have the intelligence and confidence to treat the unexpected as an opportunity to exploit.  They must be capable of informed, independent action; of what has been described as a ‘brains-based approach’ to operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have all heard the common refrain that we must do more with less.  Well, to be frank, that is what we are doing.  At the strategic level, a brains-based approach means deciding to act only when we must and then doing it well, not always kinetically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This type of thinking has shaped the work I have started on ‘How We Will Fight’.  Assuming the approach I have just outlined, I and my fellow Chiefs have designed our forces to:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a.	act jointly and with allies, but able to act alone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b.	be well equipped, but not tied to platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;c.	adapt as the environment changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we must prioritise.  And as spending has tightened, we must be ruthless in our requirements and getting the most from them.  Effectively targeting limited resources is, in large part, the art of military command in war and in peace through force design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new UK Joint Expeditionary Force is an expression of this.  The JEF promises much greater levels of integration than previously achieved especially when combined with others, as is already happening with our French allies in the Anglo/French Combined JEF.  The JEF must be genuinely synergistic.  It is the building block to future alliances and independent action.  And we would hope that allies such as Denmark and Estonia, who have fought with distinction in a British formation in Afghanistan, will want to play key roles within the British element of the CJEF.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What it offers is clear: an integrated joint force with capabilities across the spectrum at sea, on land and in the air.  A force that can confidently be allocated a specific slice of the battle space in an allied operation or act alone.  It will be the basis of all our combined joint training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the capability to ‘punch’ hard and not be a logistical or tactical drag on a coalition, we will be especially welcomed by our friends and feared by our enemies. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JEF will be of variable size; a framework into which others fit.  It will be the core of the UK’s contribution to any military action, whether NATO, coalition or independent. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together with critical C2 elements such as HQ ARRC and the emphasis placed on the maritime component HQ at Northwood, the JEF is designed to meet our NATO obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Libyan campaign, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were able to play a vital role by bringing their regional expertise into the command structure of a NATO operation.  This provided greater military and political reach.  I look forward to the alliance, perhaps in part through the vehicle of the JEF, working more with non-member states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Britain’s JEF will be capable of projecting power with global effect and influence.  Nowhere is more important to us than our friends in the Middle East and Gulf and in line with clear political intent we would expect, with other initiatives, for JEF elements to spend more time reassuring and deterring in that region. 
The Royal Navy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me briefly examine how the How We Fight work affects the single services, starting with the Royal Navy.  As the Prime Minister has put it, the Navy “keeps the arteries of trade of the global economy from hardening.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy will continue to grow in importance.  As our carrier capability comes into service it will be a key part of our diplomatic, humanitarian and military strategy.  Prepared to overcome the toughest military challenges.  This is its raison d’être.  But I know it will be used for much more.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Americans demonstrated through their deployment to Aceh and Haiti that aircraft carriers have huge strategic impact supporting people around the world.  Seeing US military personnel, ships and helicopters playing such a critical role boosted the standing of the US in the world’s most populous Islamic country and undermined extremist rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hard power is an essential element of soft power.  In this respect especially, numbers, or mass, still matter.  We must resolve the conundrum at the heart of Bob Gates quip about ‘exquisite technology’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the future, the Chief of the Naval Staff and I have a vision for a Navy which procures ships differently allowing us to have more, not fewer platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We must resist the pressure that has shrunk the number of platforms.  Clearly that will mean rethinking the Navy, including examining the case for ships that may have a limited role in general war.  But this is not new ¬¬¬– remember the corvette over the ages – and is similar to the utility of light and heavy land forces, tailored to task.  And in so doing we will ensure seamanship skills and leadership qualities, so much in demand by our friends and allies, flourish into the long term.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy’s maritime and amphibious components, with 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines at the core of the latter, will be at the heart of Britain’s JEF.  As the concept develops we will look to acquire ships that range from top-end war fighting elements through potentially to more vessels tailored to discrete but important tasks, to be deployed on a range of routine non-warfighting duties.&lt;br&gt;
The British Army&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Army too is changing.  Once we come out of the combat role in Afghanistan at the end of 2014, it will cease to be on permanent rotation with the burdens that imposes.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Army will maintain a hard power war-fighting capability while creating the strategic influence, support and engagement ability essential to modern operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the Navy, these land forces must be equipped to pack a punch but war fighting is not all they’re for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict prevention, to which I will return in a moment, is not just sensible strategy; it is a military operation requiring appropriately configured and equipped forces. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Army 2020 reforms are a fundamental re-set for the Army, making the best of a regular force a fifth smaller than when I commanded it only three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we will retain three high-readiness manoeuvre brigades, we will also have ‘adaptable brigades’ to sustain enduring operations and routinely develop partnerships and knowledge around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though more conceptual work is needed, given the importance of the region and clear Prime Ministerial intent, I envisage two or more adaptable brigades forming close tactical level relationships with particular countries in the Gulf and Jordan, for example, allowing for better cooperation with their forces.  Should the need arise for another Libya-style operation, we will be prepared.  This would greatly enhance our ability to support allies as they contain and deter threats and, with our naval presence in Bahrain, air elements in the UAE and Qatar, and traditional but potentially enhanced roles in Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, would make us a regional ally across the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Africa, brigades would be tasked to support key allies in the east, west and south whilst another might be given an Indian Ocean and SE Asian focus, allowing for much greater involvement in the FPDA, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we are to influence, we must know what drives our friends and how to motivate them.  This is not something that can be done on the eve of an operation.  As these adaptable brigades develop links with countries around their region, this will create opportunities for soldiers and officers to progress their careers through linguistic and cultural specialism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defence Engagement Strategy, prepared with the Foreign Office, will provide what I have often referred to as a ‘strategic handrail’ for engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will require tough decisions.  If we are to invest properly in some relationships, others will naturally get less attention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if we get this right ¬– and we will – we will have deeper links to specific regional partners giving them the confidence to deal with their own problems and, when appropriate, to act in partnership with us.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I have described puts military flesh on the bones of welcome, NSC endorsed, national strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all comes as we are increasing the Reserves and integrating them closer with the Regular forces.  This will do more to increase our own capacity and ability to help friends and allies.
The Royal Air Force&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turning now to the Royal Air Force.  The rate of technological advance is most keenly felt on air platforms.  This is understandable.  These are complex fully networked combat and ISTAR platforms.  This intelligence cuts the time between understanding and reacting.  It allows us better to out-think and out-act our opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, lift, both tactical and global, reduces the number of reserves we need to keep, giving the Armed Forces a flexibility that was unimaginable just a few decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding and exploiting the opportunities technology presents will be decisive in maintaining our advantage – in sufficient numbers – into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remotely piloted air systems and novel anti-air defences have changed our understanding of both what it means to fight and defend.  We must not allow sacred cows – such as the indispensability of on-board pilots – to rule the day.  The Chief of the Air Staff is leading the change.  By giving ‘wings’ to UAV pilots the Royal Air Force is recognising the capability of the platform and skill of the pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is a reflection of how early we are in this process of transition that we still refer to remotely-piloted air systems or unmanned aerial vehicles.  How long was it before we stopped referring to the horseless carriage?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all three Services, their role within an integrated CJEF will be the driving force in their force development and training.  Whoever the enemy, wherever the threat, we will need partners.  Building them now is an investment in our own future and our capacity to succeed quickly should war break out.
Cyber&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is a new environment within which we must learn to manoeuvre with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today Facebook, with around a billion users, is the third most populous country in the world.  It exemplifies one of the most extreme changes we have seen in the past decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyberspace is the nervous system of our global economy.  We are reliant on the internet and other networked systems for every aspect of our lives.  It allows bewildering speed of action and global reach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, just as crime has become e-crime, spying has increasingly become cyber espionage.  We have seen nations, their proxies and non-state actors use this new space for terrorism and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though not conventional assaults, the hostile cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008 and Burma in 2010 were damaging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Middle East, there have been unprecedented levels of cyber attack over the past 24 months.  Israel has reported over 44 million attempts to disrupt its government websites during recent tension around the Gaza strip.  STUXNET demonstrated a new class of threat aimed at process control systems at the heart of modern infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without doubt, actions in cyberspace will form part of any future conflict.  Communication and the control of infrastructure and systems has become a new environment through which combatants will further their objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our immediate priority must be to ensure our networks are secure and defensible, working with partners in industry and around the country to drive up standards and ensure we have robust protocols in place.  This builds on the excellent work done under the National Cyber Security Strategy but Defence has particular challenges as a department, as Armed Forces and through the contractors and partners with whom we work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am determined that the Armed Forces should understand cyberspace, and how it will shape future conflict, as instinctively as we understand maritime, land and air operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will mean changes in the way we operate: new doctrine; new capabilities; new structures, with Joint Forces Command at their heart.
It will mean a new approach to growing and developing the talent we need to operate in this new, electronic, environment.  Like our Secretary of State, I see an important role for reserves in this domain. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id="winding-up"&gt;Winding Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In examining each environment separately I hope I have highlighted some of the key issues on the Chiefs’ plate and how we must respond to them.  But the most important is developing an integrated Joint model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JEF is neither the 1980s Canadian model nor, whilst there are some apparent similarities, is it a British version of the US Marine Corps.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of the UK armed forces relies heavily on the different skill-sets and ethos of each single Service.  Each adapted for its environment, and evolving as times and technology change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a joint conceptual approach, based on lessons from the real world, embedded through force development, in training, on operations and though the cohering glue of modern C3I and cyber is vital to delivering the military capability the nation requires.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is about ensuring single Service skills meld into joint action so that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JEF won’t mean we can do more with less; it will mean, through the synergy it provides, that we get the most from what we have.  And doubtless there will be some roles that we continue to leave to others, notably the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I close let me draw some lessons from my 41 years in uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some constants which may seem obvious in this room but are often over looked:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a.	The need for military force to influence, secure and protect is as great as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b.	I joined an Army that was geared to defend Britain by fighting in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;c.	Today life is more complex but the principle is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;d.	9/11, and the 7/7 bombings in London show that we cannot choose our battlefields as we once did.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;e.	The world is not a safer place and the distinction between home and abroad is strategically obsolete.  Today it is part of a continuum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We cannot just stand by and hope we are ignored and danger passes us by.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the Foreign Secretary said in September last year: “the country that is purely reactive in foreign affairs is in decline”. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responses may be based on either soft or hard power, but to divorce the two is strategic blindness.  Soft power is not a substitute for strength.  On the contrary, it is often based on the credible threat of force, either to support a friend or deter an enemy.  Hard power and soft power are intertwined.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not enough to provide aid or speak kindly.  Our friends want to know we are there when it counts, not just fair-weather friends.  This is the confidence hard power brings.  It drives equipment sales and thus industrial growth, as well as diplomatic treaties, just as it has for centuries.  But hard power also does more than this: it dissuades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deterrence doctrine has fallen out of fashion so perhaps you will allow me to recall some of the elements.  Sun Tzu’s famous maxim is: “Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Too often this is seen as clever posturing on the eve of battle.  It is not.  Training, equipping and partnering with allies enhance the aura of British power.  They give us presence on the world stage and ensure that we are not tested.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth being clear: when the Armed Forces train we do not just do it to be ready, we do it to be seen to be ready.  When we succeed on operations, we do not just win a battle.  We prove that we can win a war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a very real sense, everything the Armed Forces do deters and reassures.  With enough numbers, enough equipment and with good leaders at every level, Britain is a credible threat to our enemies and a reassuring friend to our allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is cheaper than fighting and more credible than talk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading the record of how the Soviets saw the Falklands War demonstrates this admirably.  What many saw as post-colonial folie de grandeur, the Soviet leadership, rightly, saw as proof that the British Armed Forces were united with their government and people – Clausewitz’s famous trilogy – and more than a match for them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was far from the only factor, but the increase in Soviet defence spending in the 1980s which ended up contributing to the collapse of the Warsaw Pact was partly due to clarity of their failure to impose their will in neighbouring, occupied countries while Britain could liberate territory some 8,000 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Chief of the Defence Staff I do not wear the burdens of office any more lightly than my predecessors.  I have set out some of my concerns for the coming years and some of the ways we will think and act to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the Prime Minister’s chairmanship, The National Security Council, on which I am privileged to sit, considers all the big strategic issues that I have listed and more.  It is a hugely welcome addition to Whitehall, directing and bringing clarity to national strategy and coordinating cross-government action. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the nature of the world is such that what will later seem obvious, today is opaque and unpredictable.  How will Europe emerge from the Euro crisis?  How will the Arab Spring conclude?  How will global warming affect water supplies?  And what of cyber?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all, grand strategy, while providing a guide to action in peacetime, is also about being prepared and balanced for what we can never know.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensuring we have enough left in the bag while actively deterring, and when required defeating, aggression against us and our friends, enough left to succeed against those ‘unknown unknowns’, is ultimately what I and my fellow Chiefs are paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;END&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Strategy for UK Life Sciences – One Year On</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>David Willetts speech on the strategy for UK Life Sciences – One Year On.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="check-against-delivery"&gt;Check against delivery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really is an exciting time to be discussing the prospects for life sciences in the UK. We have a positive story to tell – right up to the announcements of the past week, with more than £100 million of dedicated funding for life sciences capital in the Autumn Statement and the pioneering genomics programme confirmed by the Prime Minister in Cambridge on Monday, which comes with up to £100 million more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost two years ago, however, and the situation was rather different. Indeed, while today’s event is all about reflecting on the progress we’ve made in the past 12 months since the launch of the Government’s Strategy for UK Life Sciences, I’m like to start further back – with Pfizer’s decision to close its R&amp;amp;D operations at Sandwich. Learning of that decision in early 2011 – not so long after AstraZeneca had elected to shut its facility at Charnwood – provided the starkest of warnings. It brought home the major changes underway globally in the life sciences industry: the shift away from in-house R&amp;amp;D to external collaborations and partnerships; the increasing mobility of capital as other countries raise their game and, therefore, the need for an integrated approach to attract investment and maintain competitive advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the Sandwich taskforce certainly taught us a great deal about the direction in which the industry is heading. And then, in June last year, the Prime Minister hosted a valuable and interesting seminar focused on life sciences which clearly demonstrated that we need to do better to make the necessary connections between our outstanding research base, our increasingly diverse life sciences sector – one featuring a growing number of SMEs – and our clinical strengths across the National Health Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was these fundamental insights that informed the preparation of the life sciences strategy published this time last year. In it, we determined to achieve three main things. The first was to dramatically improve collaboration between academia, industry and the NHS. The second was to boost the skills and pipeline of researchers, clinicians and technicians – without whom collaboration could not be properly realised. And the third was to foster the right business environment in the UK to encourage investment, so that we could translate discovery into real benefits for patients, support innovation through the translational funding gap, and remove bureaucratic barriers to the early adoption and diffusion of medical breakthroughs in the NHS. This week we published the Strategy for UK Life Sciences - One Year On report, showing lots of progress is underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first of these ambitions – boosting collaboration in a stronger life sciences ecosystem – the Medical Research Council has promised £130 million for work on stratified and experimental medicine, with the first round of grant recipients in stratified medicine, announced on Monday, tackling rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C and Gaucher’s disease. These three awards will establish research consortia in each of these disease areas and taken in total will combine 34 academic groups and 20 industry partners with charities and patients across the UK. We are investing £1 billion per annum through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the NHS.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the new Biomedical Catalyst, established to bridge the gap between innovative research and actual commercialisation, is already funding some great projects: to develop a new vaccine for the hospital-acquired infection C. difficile, which currently kills around 3,000 people a year in the UK; to advance a treatment for late-stage Parkinson’s that significantly reduces patients’ time in surgery; to utilise a mobile phone app that helps people with conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to manage them more effectively on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also made good progress on our second objective to support skills and talent. We’ve seen the launch of the dedicated Technical Apprenticeship Service, confirmation of the first eight Research Professorships under the aegis of the National Institute for Health Research and the successful piloting of the Society of Biology’s degree accreditation programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are committed to our third objective of having a competitive business environment. From April 2013, the Patent Box will come into force – offering a 10 per cent corporation tax rate on profits attributable to patents. To optimise the commercial environment, we are also improving the visibility and certainty of R&amp;amp;D tax relief. We hope that the introduction of an above the line R&amp;amp;D tax credit will attract large scale investment in innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all exciting, tangible stuff – promising for patients, promising for business and job creation. What’s vital now is that the work of integration continues, refining a system that makes full and optimum use of every one of its constituent elements. Ours is a 10 year strategy – and it hinges on achieving success in all areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take public investment. The ring-fenced science settlement, agreed early on by the Coalition, was a serious commitment in these straitened times – and we have built on it since. The latest money in the Autumn Statement will build the necessary research capability for the UK to compete globally in a potential $100 billion synthetic biology market. It will fund the development of a large manufacturing facility for biologic medicines such as antibodies and vaccines – improving our marketability as the location of choice for internationally mobile life sciences companies. And it will help fund imaging and cell manufacture technologies and a clean room for the UK Regenerative Medicine Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we pumped £42 million into the life sciences sector in 2012 through the Regional Growth Fund, matched by private investment of almost £185 million. We have committed £300 million for the UK Research Partnership Investment Fund. To secure investment, universities are required to match by at least double the amount they receive from the fund from non-public sources. There are several projects relevant to life sciences around the UK that have secured funding of almost £147 million. However, we understand in the UK that financial resource alone is not enough to make us the go-to destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On increasing the take up of medical innovation on the ground, the Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure at the NIHR - or NOCRI as it is known - is starting to connect industry to the best investigators, research facilities and technologies. We know that we also need to continue improvement in study performance and there is a new 70-day benchmark for providers of NHS services to proceed from receiving a valid research application to recruiting the first patient. It has been a condition of new NIHR contracts since December 2011, and performance against this will affect further funding as of April 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this and several other measures in the strategy, we know that we will only be able to truly assess impact once they have been fully implemented. For example, earlier this week Sir David Nicholson said we know good progress is being made at a time of great change in the NHS but more always remains to be done. There are deep-seated barriers to innovation that must be changed right at the heart of the NHS. David Nicholson and the new Commissioning Board will continue to push ahead to achieve a true culture of innovation throughout the NHS which is important to patients and business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message we’re seeking to transmit globally is that life sciences companies can do everything they need to in this country. They can, like Astellas Pharma, establish their headquarters here. They can, like Eli Lilly, conduct early-stage research here – exploiting UK-based expertise in an unusually broad range of disciplines, from clinical pharmacology to statistics and data sciences. Or, like GSK and Eisai, they can establish cutting-edge manufacturing plants on these shores. In the past year, the UK has received more than £1 billion of industry and private sector investment – from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Novartis and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate our capacity for pioneering research, we will of course be taking forward the large-scale genomics project – the first attempt to exploit this technology within a mainstream health system. As the Prime Minister explained on Monday, we’ll be sequencing the entire genome of up to 100,000 patients. As patterns emerge, doctors will gain more advanced understanding of cancers and inherited diseases, enabling more targeted care. A critical feature of the project, which relates to one of my earlier comments, is how it will provide the training ground for a new generation of British geneticists and will educate the wider community in harnessing genomics technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, it is essential that international companies appreciate what’s available in the UK – the knowhow, the facilities, the opportunities to conduct clinical trials. That’s where UK Trade and Investment come in. Earlier this year, UKTI established the Life Science Investment Organisation to help connect international investors and companies with all parts of our life sciences sector. Later on at today’s event, the UKTI will launch a new global campaign highlighting the many opportunities to invest in and partner with our knowledge base, our SMEs, our manufacturers and our commercial supply chain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2012, I’m proud to report that there are over 380 pharmaceutical companies based in the UK, employing nearly 70,000 people, with an annual turnover of £30 billion. The medical technology and medical biotechnology sectors represent over 4,000 companies employing nearly 100,000 people with an annual turnover of around £20 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task ahead is to build on this solid base by encouraging more spinouts, attracting more companies from overseas and further investment. We’ll be sticking with the strategy formulated a year ago with such wise counsel from experts such as Sir John Bell, Chris Brinsmead and George Freeman – and we’ll be continually exploring ways to make the UK the best place in the world to pursue life sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/12/12 - 1SL Dinner Address to the European-Atlantic Group</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech delivered by First Sea Lord at the Caledonian Club on Wednesday 12 December 2012.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="delivering-security-in-an-age-of-austerity"&gt;Delivering Security in an Age of Austerity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Lord Hamilton for your introduction.  And it’s very good to be with you all L &amp;amp; G once again this evening, having last spoken to the Group some years ago as Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="strategic-context"&gt;[Strategic Context]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Security Strategy (the NSS), published a little over 2 years ago, reminds us that……“the first duty of Government remains: the security of our country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many here will be aware, this is no easy task……made no easier in an age of austerity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has required us to be even more attuned to what I consider our principal challenge……the challenge of reconciling the breadth of uncertainty on the one hand……with the depth of fiscal reality on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a challenge I share with my fellow Chiefs, with whom I have had to make some difficult decisions…… and it’s a challenge shared by other nations too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most countries, the UK assesses that the future security environment will be one in which the threats are many, varied and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman has observed, “the extraordinary may not necessarily be the most distant”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is precisely why the NSS has adopted a national security posture of ‘Adaptable Britain’……so that we can respond to MacMillan’s apocryphal “Events, dear boy, events”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst China’s defence budget is enjoying ‘fair winds and following seas’ with annual increases typically around 11%……most western nation Defence Departments are sailing through a fiscal storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK - whilst the Defence Budget at the last Comprehensive Spending Round was the 3rd smallest reduction across Government Departments – it nevertheless represented a 7.5% reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2008, the majority of smaller European countries have cut their defence budgets by around a third……and medium-sized states by 10 to 15%.  France and Germany’s have fallen by much the same as ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as the US pivots towards the Pacific, it too is cutting its military cloth by 10%……with potentially another 10% reduction depending on the outcome of sequestration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And over the last decade, average defence spending across NATO’s European members has reduced from 2% of national GDP to 1.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite what some observers suggest, meeting this challenge - that of balancing threat uncertainty with economic reality – need not, in my view, mean forsaking national security to achieve fiscal stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="response-to-austerity"&gt;[Response to Austerity]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I say that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at the outset, I would make it clear that, from my perspective, austerity does not alter the National Security Strategy ‘Ends’……ie our level of aspiration in terms of advancing our national values and protecting our national interests worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, what austerity does do - I would venture - is call for a change of approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means that in delivering the NSS, Whitehall can afford only to focus on that which is a priority, a necessity, and delivers greatest value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, rather than altering ‘the Ends’, austerity alters ‘the Ways and the Means’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In actual fact, austerity is fuelling change on a breathtaking scale across the MoD and the RN.  Essential change that includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wide-ranging organisational reform, to align responsibility with resource&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;capability re-balancing for the future, to ensure Defence has the right blend of platforms and people to meet the most likely and most dangerous threats in the years to come&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and such change includes redirecting resources to the front line, to maintain the teeth but with a much smaller tail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austerity also means deepening and expanding the pool of collaboration……within formal NATO and EU frameworks or as part of the now-over-40-year-long membership of the Five Powers Defence Arrangement……between the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention our close bilateral relationships with the US, France, the Netherlands and many other allies besides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, for an outward looking country like the UK - engaged in and exposed to shared global opportunities, threats and interests - it makes sense for us to work with other nations and other navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly closer collaboration includes our commitment to Coalition operations in Afghanistan……but equally important is our  commitment to the ever-growing 27-nation Combined Maritime Force in the Middle East……the world’s maritime centre of gravity, with its trade routes between the Strait of Hormuz and the Suez Canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is why, as I speak, HMS PROTECTOR, our Ice Patrol Ship is in the South Atlantic for the Austral Summer supporting the peaceable aims of the Antarctic Treaty System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is why we host, off Scotland, the multinational, biannual exercise, Joint Warrior, the largest military exercise in Europe.  The next one, in the Spring, will involve: 10 nations; 40 fast jets; 55 warships, support ships and submarines; and 18,000 personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the tactical level such exercises improve interoperability, but at the strategic level they help build the all-important foundations of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think part of our response to austerity is also about making a more imaginative contribution to ‘Smart Power’……as we compose more enduring outcomes and effects by weaving both soft and hard power assets more elaborately into a complex counterpoint:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where the military is part of a more nuanced first resort……to better understand the security situation so that we can improve our ability to anticipate tension……as well as to do something to contain it;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and where we also put an increased emphasis on, for example, upstream conflict prevention and capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But above all, based on a national security posture of ‘Adaptable Britain’, such change also, importantly, requires us to adjust our approach to how, in the future, we will fight……as we move from, as the Secretary of State for Defence puts it, “Campaigns to Contingency”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an adjustment which places a premium upon highly capable, high-readiness forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rn-response"&gt;[RN Response]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why under that microscope of austerity……the Royal Navy is placing a renewed emphasis upon capability and readiness……to deliver a credible contingency……a contingency which demands that navies are forward deployed with the right capability……preventing crises from emerging and possessing the ability to respond to the unforeseen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ie contingent forces……not garrisoned in Naval Bases……but at sea, at readiness……and there to be used.  As indeed we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out there right now, nearly 4500 loyal, courageous and professional sailors and marines are on operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And around 70% of our available ships and submarines are either undergoing pre-deployment training or deployed worldwide……where their presence alone sends a strong message of the UK’s ongoing commitment to those NSS ‘Ends’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with austerity acting as a catalyst for further collaboration, for embracing ‘smart power’, and for credible contingency……the broad utility of maritime forces can be used to good effect.  Let me share with you a couple of examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take HMS DAUNTLESS’s inaugural deployment earlier this year on Atlantic Patrol Task (South) reassurance duties……where this Type 45 Destroyer provided capability ‘at readiness’ within range of our South Atlantic Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet the transit to and from the region also presented a variety of opportunities to support the UK’s  emerging International Defence Engagement Strategy.  On passage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAUNTLESS undertook national maritime security tasking in support of the Lisbon-based Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre for Narcotics……hunting drug runners if you will&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;she participated in exercises with Atlantic-facing NATO and EU partners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;she conducted tasking in support of the UK’s counter-narcotics Memorandum of Understanding with Cape Verde&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and she contributed to maritime security capacity building in West Africa……whether assisting Gulf of Guinea states to improve the security of trade and energy extraction, or of their vital fishing stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And consider the Response Force Task Group (the RFTG), the UK’s quick-reaction maritime force…… another example of the broad utility of maritime forces across these growth areas of further collaboration, smart power and credible contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, the task group consists of a mix of warships, submarines, aircraft and marines……tailored for task and able to integrate with the other Services and other nations as required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, under NATO’s 16-nation maritime element, the RFTG helped liberate Libya……as well as simultaneously undertake national contingent tasking east of Suez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Summer, on the Thames and off the South Coast, it supported Olympic security, arguably the largest peacetime operation in Britain since WWII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And over the last 2 months the RFTG has been operating in the Mediterranean with our highly-prized amphibious forces embarked……forward deployed, providing contingency whilst developing the Combined Anglo-French Joint Expeditionary Force, as well as exercising with US and Albanian Forces……NATO’s oldest and youngest members respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-approach"&gt;[The Approach]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that the forces we do have are used to best effect is obviously important, especially in such straitened times……but our success, in terms of “reconciling the breadth of uncertainty with the depth of fiscal reality” will I think depend on our ability to do 3 things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, our ability to manage coherency……internally, because of the numerous programmes and initiatives across a Defence-wide change agenda to deliver Future Force 2020……the size and shape of our Armed Forces around that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And externally……because as other nations’ militaries adjust their capabilities and readiness, as well as us, we all need to keep talking in order to understand the implications of others’ austerity upon our own intent…… and especially so in a more ‘dependant’ culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also need to be able to strike the right balance between efficiency and effectiveness……ie deliver value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While protecting our nation’s interests worldwide……from landing marines on the Al Faw Peninsular in 2003 to evacuating civilians to safety from Lebanon in 2006……the Royal Navy has been driving efficiency right across its business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there’s little distinction between the frontline and the non-frontline……such is the direct impact that those working in our lean HQs have on operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And where possible, we have de-latched people from platforms (on our Mine Counter Measure Vessels in the Gulf for instance)……to maximise time on task.  We keep the platforms on station for around 2 years whilst we rotate the crews every 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are working even harder to find innovative solutions, like optimising the training pipeline such that every warship and nuclear submarine is a classroom……as well as an operational platform and expression of UK sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All very laudable, but we must be careful that our pursuit of efficiency is not at the expense of the very operational effectiveness that we seek to enhance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, and arguably most importantly, we need to maintain long-term ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because ambition fuels change, fuels progress and, in the business of defence, fuels military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It demands us to lift our sights……to look even more imaginatively at what we can potentially do to deliver more effect and more influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, ensuring we contribute more meaningfully to upstream conflict prevention in terms of capacity building, maritime security and that emerging International Defence Engagement Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly what warships like HMS DAUNTLESS around the Gulf of Guinea can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, we must maintain a long-term ambition to ensure that, in the future, we can match the ‘spectrum of capability’ to the ‘spectrum of uncertainty’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, just what highly capable warships, like HMS DAUNTLESS can do……and what equally capable Type 26 Global Combat Ships, the mainstay of the future Fleet, will be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping our sights focussed on the long-term is vital.  Because our measure of success in delivering security in an age of austerity is not just about delivering security now of course……it’s about delivering it in the next decade and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the threat environment will certainly be more dynamic and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the middle of only the next decade, the world will be very different to the one we understand today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will have a billion more mouths to feed;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;almost everyone in Africa may have a mobile phone;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and China will comprise around 30% of global GDP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So our measure of success will I think depend on whether or not we are ready to shape and respond to a world in geopolitical flux……around what some refer to as “pivotal regions”……regions, in which global trends (such as resource, energy, climate change and demographics) will converge, giving such regions an importance disproportionate to their geopolitical status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, it is such regions that are most likely to generate tensions that impact on global security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They include the wider Middle East, the Asian Meridian, both Polar regions, the Korean peninsula, and sub-Saharan Africa.  And with the exception of the latter, they all have a strong maritime dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So being ready for such change is the long-term test……for nations and navies on not just both sides of the Atlantic, but for maritime nations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="closing"&gt;[Closing]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I draw to a close, amidst such challenges it is easy to become disheartened by the whiff of Dickensian austerity associated with my theme this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I want to leave you with just 2 brief illustrations of where delivering security and defence in an age of austerity still has the long term for our nation at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is the investment in Carrier Strike……which will give the UK the capability and readiness that a value for money Defence must provide ……especially when the cost of operating our carriers is marginal (just 1%) to the cost of building them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, £60M to operate the capability annually buys a considerable amount of international influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already crewing up in Rosyth, the QUEEN ELIZABETH will, in 15 months time, be brought out of dock to commence sea trials in 2016……and to allow assembly of the PRINCE OF WALES to start, although large blocks of her are already under construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally impressive is the infrastructure work, in terms of jetties and seabed, in Portsmouth……as the City and Naval Base prepare to operate the sort of tonnage from her harbour not seen since the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just over 5 years from now, 5th generation F-35B Lightning jets will be flying from HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the end of this decade, the first operational deployment will take place……and with it the UK will once again make the most of the utility of air power from the sea……because countries that have carriers use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because “the first duty of Government remains: the security of our country”……my second illustration concerns, “the UK’s ultimate insurance policy in this age of uncertainty”……our nuclear deterrent, which has provided security day in day out for over 43 years……not just for the UK of course, but as part of our contribution to NATO’s Collective Defence umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must be mindful of the ongoing ‘Alternatives Study’……but one cannot overlook the recent commitment to award initial design contracts with BAE systems regarding the programme to replace the Vanguard class submarine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a few months ago, the Prime Minister reiterated his commitment in the House to, as he put it…… “retaining an independent nuclear deterrent based on the Trident missile system” and emphasised his recognition that, again in his words, “being continuously at sea is a key part of our deterrent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;To which, in conclusion L &amp;amp; G, I would add that “being continuously at sea” is an important part of conventional deterrence too……and especially in an age of austerity.  For it ensures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the beacon of maritime cooperation burns brighter;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that we build upon our contribution to ‘smart power’, especially in terms of upstream conflict prevention;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, with navies being ‘at sea’ and ‘at readiness’, it ensures that we remain a credible contingency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening and I look forward to your questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>National summit to end rough sleeping</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by Housing Minister Mark Prisk on the launch of StreetLink and successful local steps to end rough sleeping.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time of year, when the cold weather bites, it’s natural that people are concerned when they see people sleeping on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as you know better than most, this is not just an issue at Christmas; it’s a year-round problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is not enough to offer a helping hand just during the season of good will. To really make a difference, we need to tackle the causes of rough sleeping, all the year round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="government-action"&gt;Government action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the problems we face today, is a lack of affordable homes in the housing market. A market in which, for 15, maybe 20 years, we have seen just half the homes we actually need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, when this government came to power, we committed to building more homes, and more affordable homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means unlocking substantial investment of £19.5 billion so we’re able to deliver 170,000 new affordable homes over this Parliament. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means a significant expansion of the private rented sector, to give tenants much greater choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it’s a sector that has often been overlooked, which is why we asked Sir Adrian Montague to carry out an independent review of the sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve now adopted his excellent report with a clear commitment, to provide a £10 billion debt guarantee and a £200 million equity finance fund, so that we can deliver more new homes for rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s often a debate about whether to focus on owner occupied homes, or the private rented sector, or affordable housing. But we need to deliver in all 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, we want there to be a bigger, better housing market, capable of providing people with more quality and more choice at affordable prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we are building more homes, but we’re also determined to address all the issues that drive people towards homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we protected £400 million of funding, for tackling and preventing homelessness, over 4 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because homelessness is caused by the convergence of different problems, my predecessor Grant Shapps established the Ministerial Working Group that, for the first time, regularly brings ministers together from across Whitehall - from Health and Welfare, to Justice and even Defence - because we need to look at all the links between homelessness and for example, mental health, as well as some of the unique challenges which people face if veterans or former prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="homelessness-prevention"&gt;Homelessness prevention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we’ve put the right building blocks in place, and today I want to discuss how else we’re moving forward, not least by focussing on prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular the new approach, through StreetLink to stop people slipping through the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means tackling the underlying problems. And, (if people do turn to sleeping rough), early intervention to ensure they are swiftly helped off the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why, (on top of the £400 million funding for tackling homelessness), we announced an additional £70 million last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extra cash is ensuring vulnerable single people, (a high risk group), get early access to good housing advice, to prevent them becoming homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="no-second-night-out"&gt;No Second Night Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also looking to boost hostel provision, and supporting the national roll out of ‘&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nosecondnightout.org.uk/"&gt;No Second Night Out&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now after a really encouraging pilot in London (which we were able to support), this initiative is proving essential in ensuring people do not become caught up in a pattern of sleeping rough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s proved effective at providing a rapid response to new rough sleepers, by ensuring that no one has to sleep out for a second night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, tackling problems early is fundamental to the scheme’s success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m pleased that the momentum for ‘No Second Night Out’ is growing, with several more authorities adopting the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merseyside was quick off the mark, being the first area outside London to introduce their own initiative last February. 6 local authorities are now working in partnership, to really put an end to persistent rough sleeping they’ve had to endure right across the Liverpool city region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a commendable achievement and an example to other authorities - and you will hear more about how they delivered this when Councillor Anne O’Byrne speaks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="streetlink"&gt;StreetLink&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are many people beyond government (and the professionals) who also want to help. Often they see people sleeping rough, but they are not quite sure what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re concerned that giving money isn’t the best solution, but don’t know where else to turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, as a government, we decided to support your sector to develop a new approach, with the launch of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.streetlink.org.uk/"&gt;StreetLink&lt;/a&gt; today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how will it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, for the general public StreetLink provides a central point of contact, that people who want to help rough sleepers can call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minute anyone sees someone on their local street or town centre sleeping rough in their neighbourhood, they will be able to contact StreetLink and provide details on a confidential and secure basis, so vulnerable people can be found and connected to local services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of the new approach is that it’s easy to use. StreetLink will be contactable by phone on 0300 500 0914, by using the website, the mobile website accessible by smartphone, or by using the StreetLink ‘app’, available for iphones and android devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You maybe concerned that it’s difficult to do, but if I can get it on my mobile (and my wife will confirm), anyone can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it won’t just be about reporting problems: members of the public will also be able to see what action has been taken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ll be able to ask for email feedback from local services about the outcome of the information they’ve provided, and see the outcomes of their referrals on the StreetLink website, on a Google map that they can search by location. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for the first time, the public will be able to judge for themselves whether rough sleeping is being taken seriously and tackled effectively in their locality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean for service providers - local authorities and your sector? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By involving the public, it will mean your outreach teams can help more people, because you will have better intelligence about what’s happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeless Link tell me that every local authority has agreed to accept referrals, with some already receiving and acting on the details provided by the public through the website, which has been live for over two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also supports your approach to helping rough sleepers. You, more than anyone, know that they need a hand-up, not just a handout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the public will now be able to turn their concern into practical, effective action, and take a direct step to help vulnerable adults change their lives for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally - it will help link up the different services helping rough sleepers. Callers in an area with a ‘No Second Night Out’ initiative or other rough sleeping helpline will be transferred directly to that scheme. In other areas StreetLink will refer the details to the local authority or local outreach team for action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a smart, joined-up way of tackling the problem, and will have truly national coverage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’d like to pay tribute to Homeless Link and Broadway for its development, using the support from government. It’s real partnership in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, most of us will struggle to understand what it is like to sleep on the streets. That’s why, when people see rough sleepers, they want to reach out and help them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a government, we are determined to engage with this issue, and ensure the right intervention is made, as early as possible. We need to break the habit to help people to turn their lives around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this must be a collaborative effort - including local authorities and the voluntary and charity sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me say a big thank you to all of you for the vital work you do. It’s tempting for the media to think it’s just a Christmas issue, but it’s 365 days a year. You are part of the reason we have one of the best safety nets in the world, to prevent and tackle homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m particularly delighted that, from today, StreetLink will strengthen this safety net. Everyone will now have an easy and effective way of helping change the lives of those who have been on the fringe, for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s much more to do, but I’m confident that, together, we can make a real difference to thousands of people, who are real in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Britain and the Philippines: Partners for Prosperity</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire has given a speech about the growing trade partnership between the UK and the Philippines. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to be here today, and especially pleased that we are in the company of Foreign Secretary del Rosario. I would like to thank the Makati Business Club, the Management Association of the Philippines and the British Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a real thrill to be in the Philippines, on my first official visit to this beautiful country. It is almost 30 years since I was last here, in a personal capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a busy two days ahead and have just come from a very productive meeting with President Aquino, during which we discussed how Britain and the Philippines can work together to tackle today’s global challenges and support each other’s prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is on the latter that I will focus today. I will talk first about the United Kingdom’s role in today’s changing world, before setting out why I think Britain and the Philippines can be powerful partners for prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom, like the Philippines, is an island nation – a characteristic which, unsurprisingly, has shaped how we view ourselves and the world around us. Britain is a relatively small place. We had enough but not bountiful natural resources. Combine that with a predisposition towards adventure and discovery, and it led us to build truly global networks and trade links. One thinks of names like Drake, Raleigh and Shackleton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No market was too far or too difficult; no peak too high. Indeed, the globalisation that people tend to view today as a very modern phenomenon has roots that go much deeper. The world in which the Victorians lived was far more integrated in some ways, with Britain sitting at the heart of a global economic system, including a de facto single currency – the Gold Standard.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this brought us to South-East Asia. Our ties to countries like Malaysia and Singapore are perhaps best known and are still extremely strong. However, Britain’s links to the Philippines stretch back just as far. The first British Consul arrived as early as 1844. And I am reminded of one of your most famous national heroes, José Rizal, who lived in London’s Primrose Hill in the 1880s. Visitors today will find a blue plaque on the house in which he lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, and particularly in the last couple of decades, I have heard some say that Britain lost sight of the importance of South-East Asia; that our attention was diverted elsewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is certainly true that relationships changed. But while it may have felt to some as if Britain had lost focus, we never went away. The commercial figures alone bear this out. UK trade and investment with South-East Asia today is still far higher than it is with China, despite the exceptional levels of growth and development that China has seen over the past 15 years. That said, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has under the current Government significantly strengthened this focus, placing an even greater emphasis on our engagement with South-East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have rebalanced our foreign policy and diplomatic network. On a practical level, that means opening new missions, sending more diplomats to places like the Philippines. We are creating around 50 new jobs across the region. And I am sure many of you will have taken note of last month’s visit to Laos by the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, to reopen the British Embassy there. The UK is now represented in all ten ASEAN countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are taking this new approach because we see the emergence and re-emergence of economies across the world – not least the growth and development in Asia – as an opportunity. I believe there is much that we can achieve if we work together.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift in focus is a key element of my Government’s efforts to deliver sustainable economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to move away from an unbalanced growth model, reliant on government spending, to one based on expanding trade, encouraging inward investment, increasing the share of our economy that comes from exports, and manufacturing the goods that today’s consumers want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are to meet our ambitious target to double exports to £1 trillion a year by 2020, we need to grow our exports by eight percent a year. Some of these will go to traditional markets like the European Union, but we are looking increasingly to fast-growing economies in places like South-East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within Europe, the UK is leading the efforts to open up the EU market to trade with other nations. Growth may be slow in Europe – the forecasts suggest we can expect only 0.4 per cent next year – but it is still the biggest marketplace in the world, doing £11 trillion of business every year and encompassing 500 million consumers and 21 million companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving our prosperity agenda forward won’t be easy – the global economic environment clearly remains a challenge. But it is a challenge I am confident Britain can respond to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work we are doing within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to embed commercial thinking should help. We are now training our diplomats in commercial as well as foreign affairs, and deploying new commercial staff across our diplomatic network. Our Ambassadors increasingly undertake secondments to companies before taking up their postings to gain firsthand commercial experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And despite the often bleak commentary from elements of the media, the British economy has real strengths. Just think of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games held earlier this year. The Games followed hot on the heels of Her Majesty The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, and showcased to the world Britain’s diversity, openness, creativity and dynamism – politically, culturally and economically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is renowned for its excellence in financial services, the creative industries and, of course, in education. But as anyone who visited the British Business Embassy at Lancaster House in London during the Olympics would have noticed, we also remain one of the world’s most important manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain’s car industry, currently undergoing a renaissance, is one such example. We are home to seven global car manufacturers.  Ford, General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover and Mini you will know, but we also have big investments from Honda, Toyota and Nissan too, who produced over 480,000 vehicles in Britain last year. In total, more than one million vehicles and two million engines are produced in the UK each year, and over three-quarters of the vehicles we manufacture are exported. And enthusiasts of faster cars will know that eight Formula One teams have their headquarters in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the UK’s expertise across this and many other sectors makes us a highly compatible partner for the Philippines. I would point, for instance, to finance, where our ICT specialists are helping the Philippine Stock Exchange expand their optic fibre network across the ASEAN region; and to healthcare, where our extensive experience in Public-Private Partnerships is helping the Philippines in their plans to develop a centre of excellence in orthopaedic medicine, modelled on the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our sectoral expertise is certainly not the only reason. What makes Britain a particularly attractive partner is, I think, the openness of our economy, our transparency and adherence to the rule of law and our firm belief in the rules-based system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time of economic uncertainty, some are inevitably tempted to close ranks and protect domestic industries and markets. But protectionism is a short-term measure with long-term consequences, and in Britain we are taking the opposite approach. History has taught us that more trade, more competitiveness and making the UK open for business and open for investment are what will steer us towards sustainable economic growth.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is heading down the same path, and I would highlight four areas that point towards this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is corruption, which remains a scourge on the global economy. It adds as much as 10 percent to the total cost of doing business globally, and up to 25 percent of the cost of procurement contracts in developing countries. Those who are hardest hit are often the poorest and most vulnerable in society. That is why we are proud to have introduced the Bribery Act in the UK to address this all-too-common problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Aquino’s anti-corruption efforts and business-friendly policies such as the Integrity Initiative and the decision to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative are exactly the right thing to be doing – particularly now, during this period of global economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second area is building the infrastructure needed to provide the foundations for long-term prosperity. Modern economies need roads, digital and cellular communications, public transport, schools and hospitals. Without them, we cannot deliver the skilled and trained workforce required to compete in the 21st Century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third area is ensuring peace and stability. This is perhaps the most crucial platform for prosperity. I am proud that the UK played a small but important role in the framework agreement in Mindanao as a member of the international contact group.  And I would like to take this opportunity to repeat our deepest condolences for the terrible devastation caused there by Typhoon Pablo. Successful implementation of the framework agreement will unlock the economic potential of that area. We are also working closely with Secretary del Rosario and his team to bring about a peaceful resolution of the claims in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connected to international peace and stability is the fourth area: shunning protectionism and embracing free trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines’ future will not be shaped by growth in the archipelago alone. Whether it is through its overseas workers, the foreign investment that can create jobs, or its export markets abroad, it is clear that future prosperity here will be based on partnerships. This agenda is moving in the right direction.  But I think we can go further and faster. Agreeing a free trade agreement between the EU and the Philippines would be a valuable step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that this policy prescription is good for your economy. But it is also vital for your broader development. International trade and investment is not just the best route to development; history tells us it is the only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am speaking to you here today because I think – in fact I am certain – that the relationship between Britain and the Philippines can play an important part in promoting our mutual prosperity. We have much in common, and economies that rely on a strong and open global economy. We are democracies, with a strong attachment to human rights and the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier today Secretary del Rosario marked this growth by signing a joint plan of action that will take our relationship to a new level. This is a genuinely exciting proposition. Our partnership will help to shape the business environment – working together on issues like anti-corruption, competitiveness, economic reform, a low-carbon economy and building awareness about the opportunities for trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade between our countries currently stands at around £1.1 billion. That is impressive, but is I think a fraction of what it can be, particularly when you consider just how fast your country is growing. In this year’s third quarter, growth in the Philippines reached 7.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joint action plan should help us to realise this potential. But we as governments can only do so much. Ultimately, it is businesses that will drive growth. We need your help to generate interest, build awareness and deliver projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am therefore pleased that we have with us today some excellent examples of successful companies operating here –like Standard Chartered Bank, Marks and Spencer and Debenhams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On visas – not always an easy subject – I know that we have a fast, fair and efficient service here, and that we are opening new services to facilitate quick and easy travel for business via Saturday openings, a premium service and a new visa application centre in Cebu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One sign that we are indeed open to business is the large number of Filipino overseas workers that are employed in the UK, who are making a valuable contribution to our economy but also sending back remittances to family in the Philippines. Their contribution cuts across many sectors, but is particularly evident in health and care work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect that our new visa services will lead to many more visitors travelling between our countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help bring this about, I will sign a new air services agreement later today with Secretary Abaya, and meet Ramon Ang and Philippines Airlines, who hope to start direct flights to London soon. And, incidentally, their passengers will probably be arriving on new aircraft made partly in Britain, following the announcement by Philippines Airlines in August of a $7 billion order from Airbus for over 50 new aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want to share our policy experience in infrastructure development, energy and Public-Private Partnerships so you can learn from our experiences, our successes and, occasionally, our mistakes. When President Aquino visited London in the summer, he went to St Pancras Station, a successful example of how well Public-Private Partnerships can work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope what you have heard today is a clear indication of the UK’s role in today’s global economy, of what is happening here in the Philippines and, most importantly, a compelling vision for how Britain and the Philippines can be partners for prosperity, looking to the future with confidence and optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My visit is just one of what I am confident will be many high-level visits in the coming months. I know that my colleague, the Foreign Secretary William Hague, is keen to visit in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the rest of my programme, and – with your agreement – I will not leave it another 30 years before I return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>Speech to the Office of Rail Regulation members about rail transparency, fares and usage through the Olympics.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank-you ladies and gentlemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great pleasure to join you today for this important conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re here to talk about ‘transparency’ – one of those modern buzzwords that we hear all the time in politics, business, and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by giving you my own perspective on transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transparency-for-the-customer"&gt;Transparency for the customer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I speak as a rail minister…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a regular user of the rail network…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a Liberal Democrat…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have campaigned for transparency ever since I was first elected in 1997.  The first bill I presented to Parliament was on the release of public records and I was the first person to submit a &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; request of MPs’ expenses, with all the ramifications that led to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you won’t be surprised that I’m a passionate believer in transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s something we need to see more of from every powerful institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud of the progress we have made to open up government and the wider public sector in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I will say this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about building the respect, trust and confidence of the people who use and fund the network - passengers, freight customers, and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true measure of transparency comes not from those who claim to practise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes from those on the outside who stand to benefit from it… the passengers and the public who provide the patronage and pounds sterling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be a shared agenda, while we have made big strides over the past few years, we still have some way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/government/publications/report-of-the-laidlaw-inquiry"&gt;Laidlaw report&lt;/a&gt; last week made a specific criticism of the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; when it said the department wasn’t transparent enough with bidders about the franchise process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are correcting that and we will be more transparent in future, but you have to do your bit as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rail-transparency"&gt;Rail transparency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me put rail transparency in some sort of perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;Open Public Services White Paper&lt;/a&gt; last year set the scene for the government’s transparency agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was followed this year by another White Paper and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/dft-open-data-strategy"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Open Data Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamental to these programmes are public services which are responsive to the people they serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations which can be held to account by citizens and elected representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open data is crucial to this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our rail reform programme highlighted 3 specific areas for transparency: rail finances; network performance and open access to information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so much has already been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together we are now publishing a great deal of performance data, from right time and passenger complaints to statistics on overcrowding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; has set out the costs of supporting the network by &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt;; subsidies per mile; and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network Rail has separated accounts by route. And new information about &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt; finances will be published next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And passengers have much better access to timetables and real time service information than they had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, data produced by Network Rail is allowing developers to generate phone and computer apps for passengers on how trains are running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a private-sector, not-for-dividend, company limited by guarantee, Network Rail is not currently subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Nonetheless, as a regulated provider of public services, in receipt of public subsidy, the company wisely recognises the demand for more of its information and data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, it began a programme to publish more of its information and data on its website, including an on-line form allowing members of the public to make suggestions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government welcomes these steps, which will improve the organisation’s accountability to passengers and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I welcome the excellent news from the last &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dft-transport-sector-transparency-board"&gt;Transport Transparency Board&lt;/a&gt; that the fares database will be released as open data during the first quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="olympics"&gt;Olympics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these transparency measures are designed for long-term dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Olympic Games earlier this year set the industry a more immediate challenge around the provision of transport data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key part of the programme was to provide businesses and the public with information about the transport network, and which stations were likely to be busiest at different times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Transport for London"&gt;TfL&lt;/abbr&gt;, Network Rail, &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt; and train operators worked with organisers to produce ‘hotspot’ data which was published on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.getaheadofthegames.com/"&gt;Get Ahead of the Games&lt;/a&gt; website – together with journey planners and interactive tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site had over 16 million page views and 4 million unique users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it played a key role in what was an enormously successful operation to manage transport demand during the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experience was invaluable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It showed just what can be achieved by planning ahead and communicating information to users of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was also a lesson in how to deliver data effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is of little use if it’s too complicated or inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has to be carefully managed, targeted and presented to meet the needs and expectations of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s precisely what was achieved by the team who delivered the Olympics transport plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fares-and-ticketing"&gt;Fares and ticketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the government re-shuffle back in September, the new &lt;a href="/government/people/patrick-mcloughlin"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; asked me to lead the &lt;a href="/government/consultations/rail-fares-and-ticketing-review"&gt;fares and ticketing review&lt;/a&gt; in the department.  You will appreciate that this is a hugely labyrinthine process.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I am concerned, transparency is key to the review.  I want an outcome where the passenger can easily access the right information to enable them to buy the right ticket for their journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while many do, many don’t.  Indeed, there appears to be some confusion even at the highest levels, judging by &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;’s comments in the metro last week blaming the government for the rise in unregulated fares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now turn to the issue of right-time information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="right-time"&gt;Right-time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will know, I have been pushing for the release of right-time – the number of trains arriving within 59 seconds of the advertised arrival time - for some time now, actually for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first raised this formally at the Performance Delivery Group which I chair on 20 July 2011 and I am to be honest disappointed that it has taken this long to get where we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear that it is not the intention of the government to replace &lt;abbr title="Public Performance Measure"&gt;PPM&lt;/abbr&gt; with right-time for performance benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may together conclude that the correct benchmark is whether a long-distance service arrives within 9 minutes and 59 seconds, but it is close to dishonest to suggest that a train arriving 9 minutes and 59 seconds after its stated arrival time is on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public are entitled to know the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I recognise, and indeed sympathise, that there is a concern within the industry that if this information is published, you will be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I observe at this point that ScotRail recently released its right-time data and the world has not ended north of the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that releasing information to the public can be uncomfortable – just look at the hundreds of &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; requests we have to deal with in the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; each month.  But actually the free availability of information is a key tool to driving up performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry will be releasing right-time data by &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt; on 20 December, even if the timing means it won’t be getting much coverage, I will be making a lot of noise about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be making comments saying what a good showing this is from the industry.  In terms of both performance and transparency we’re ahead of our European competitors so this staging post is welcome, but we need to go further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commuter on the 6:40 from Aylesbury, the student on the 8:32 to Brighton and the occasional traveller on the 10:15 to Nuneaton have a right to know whether their train is regularly on time or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look fwd to these passengers having the data they need when we make a further right-time release in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This information is held by the ORR and, as such, it is available under the &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; laws.  It is in my view far better for the industry to be on the front-foot with this rather than have it extracted by someone hostile to the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-transport-sectors"&gt;Other transport sectors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony is that the rail industry is doing pretty well in punctuality.  Both in comparisons with other countries, and in this country when compared with other modes.  Why hide your light under a bushel as if there is a guilty secret?  Those of you who have been to my office will have heard me reference the poster in my office which champions the railway against the clogged road network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am determined the same level of transparency should apply to other transport sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Highways Agency, for example, has released a wide range of statistics about roadworks and real-time traffic conditions, and over 80% local authorities have opened up their roadwork data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working with the Agency to improve reliability data for the motorway network, and hope to publish information on the wider road network next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus industry has released its national database of services across Britain, with access to real time information from all 350,000 bus stops… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple but enormously effective improvement for passengers, particularly during these winter months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the aviation industry is also embracing transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is already publishing monthly punctuality data by route and airline for 10 UK airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our Civil Aviation Bill will enshrine further powers to collect and publish data to help the consumer. Specifically, it will require the industry to provide information that the CAA considers appropriate to help passengers understand and compare different services and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Bill has completed its passage through Parliament and now awaits Royal Assent.  We anticipate that this will be before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s more the aviation industry could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, we would like the airlines to provide clearer information about the ticket price their customers should expect to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in reality, you have a good story to tell.  Some of you, however, are mindlessly trying to cover it up.  This is 1950s thinking and frankly, it won’t wash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me conclude by first of all recognising and congratulating the industry for the strides it has made towards greater transparency in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an industry that received £3 billion of public subsidy in 2010/11, the public has a right to clearer and more open information on costs, performance and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is what you are delivering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also urge you – wherever possible – to press ahead with further transparency in the future so it becomes embedded in the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I believe that whatever helps the passenger will ultimately help the railway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/12/03 - Centre for Defence Enterprise Marketplace</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech delivered by Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, MOD on Monday 3 December 2012.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning to everyone, and thank you Richard [Brooks] for that kind introduction. I am very pleased that so many people have been able to make it here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting moment for the Centre for Defence Enterprise (&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched by the previous Government in 2008 as a delivery mechanism for allowing better access for technology &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; (Small and Medium Enterprises) to defence research and ultimately the wider Defence Market, I see the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; now as helping the Ministry of Defence achieve two principle goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;firstly to act as the entry point for new science and technology innovation bringing new thinking and ideas to Defence &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and secondly to act as a key bridge linking &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; to the main defence suppliers, as well as investors and wider Government, as part of the MOD’s priority to raise participation by &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; in defence procurement &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; calls for, receives and assesses research proposals. It then funds, supports and promotes projects that it regards as plausible with potential to meet defence needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It encourages innovative companies to address Defence issues through face to face surgeries, unclassified and open conferences, and through its innovative electronic contracting portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this activity is run from a small base in a commercial office block at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire. One of &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;’s strengths is its fleetness of foot, born of a lean and efficient structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; was set up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To provide visibility of the MOD’s requirements &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To inform and support new supply networks that widen the MOD’s supplier base &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And above all to get the best and most innovative ideas into MOD’s Science and Technology Programme &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today marks another important milestone of the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;. A new turn in &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;’s evolving journey to discover innovation, and then help in the realisation of those ideas into defence and security capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what innovation has been discovered. In the last four years the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; has received nearly 4,000 proposals for funding, resulting in some 600 contracts, worth around £35 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few projects have made it directly into the hands of users, but that is an exception for most research work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we want to see those &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and universities who have successfully demonstrated innovative technology, to have the chance to present their capabilities to our prime contractors - boosting their prospects of being taken into the supply chain. And that’s what today’s marketplace is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some amazing ideas and technologies which have been developed by the innovators we have funded. I hope you will be able to stay and hear the details today, some of which are also on view in the exhibition downstairs on the second floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="exhibition-examples"&gt;Exhibition Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward shortly to going round this exhibition, and to meeting the people who are working to deliver innovative battle winning capabilities which support the front line. And I encourage you all to look around if you have the opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example, on display downstairs is Blue Bear Systems Research and their morphing wing for small Unmanned Air Vehicles based on the dynamics of a bird wing. This project exploits the design work already done by Mother Nature, to help ensure our next generation of UAVs can be both faster and more agile, as well as having greater endurance when required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is the compact, high performance heat sensing video camera developed by Dreampact, which can be handheld or rifle mounted for surveillance or gunsight use in conditions of total darkness, fog, smoke or dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our universities are also represented today with ingenious electronics and autonomously learning logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the projects featured demonstrate the ingenuity and practical focus of the &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and universities that we are working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging this technological innovation to flourish is vital to our national security and our prosperity, contributing to export led recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="wider-st-policy"&gt;Wider S&amp;amp;T Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my new role I have responsibility also for Defence exports as well as procurement, so encouraging responsible Defence exports is a particular priority for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is partly to stimulate this growth which is why the MOD has protected its annual investment in Science and Technology at 1.2% of the Defence Budget - over £400 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is protecting this budget so important? Well, in a future that is so unpredictable, defence science and technology provides insurance against the future threats and conflicts we may face; and supports the MOD’S ability to be an intelligent customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our defence transformation programme transfers responsibility for primary equipment procurement to the Commands, each will need to build capability to look forward to its future needs. This will better align our science and technology spend to the research and development priorities of our front line commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence is about developing Armed Forces and Defence capability that can deal with a broad range of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our blueprint for agile, adaptable Armed Forces is Future Force 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be effective Future Force 2020 must have the best equipment available: class leading platforms, complex weapon systems and supporting ISTAR assets. Our personnel need the best training and personal equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector and our world class academic institutions will be central to deliver this Future Force. The complexity of much of these platforms needs, by necessity, substantial industrial capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From cyber, to space, to nano technology, Britain has world leading companies underpinned by world leading scientific research, some of which I have already seen helping our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A profitable and high tech British Defence and Security sector is essential to achieving all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many of the platform projects will be managed through large system level contracts by our Prime contractors, there will be numerous participants in the supply chain, from large companies, to academia, to &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="smes"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; make an enormous contribution to the economy and in particular to innovation. And I want to take a moment to emphasise their role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; are not the only source of original thinking in our sector, but they often provide the niche expertise which can lead to breakthroughs in defence applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I know that The Centre for Defence Enterprise has already done some excellent work in supporting &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; in this area, helping them to commercialise their high tech ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank my predecessor, Peter Luff, who I am delighted to see is with us today. Peter did much to champion Science and Technology, the crucial role of Small and medium sized enterprises to delivering innovation, and to starting the conversation that led to this event today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, like him, am a champion of the &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; doing innovative work in the Defence and Security sector. They are the lifeblood of any sector. In defence they deliver innovation, flexibility, efficiency and agility, when responding to our requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is essential that &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; - whose issues are often very different from those of Primes - have their own platform within the defence industry to engage with the Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why I chair a dedicated &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprise"&gt;SME&lt;/abbr&gt; Forum which addresses the concerns of smaller companies, and why the MOD is taking a significant number of steps, alongside wider Government to work to ensure &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; can reach their potential when responding to defence requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD has a detailed action plan, led by our &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprise"&gt;SME&lt;/abbr&gt; Champion, Les Mosco, who will be talking to you later today, to drive forward &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprise"&gt;SME&lt;/abbr&gt; involvement in defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have addressed some really important issues such as the treatment of IPR for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identify issues that MoD needs to address and which the &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; themselves need to think about too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are encouraging our prime contractors to inform us of the part &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; play in their own supply chain and I have personally invited the Chief Executives of our top twenty suppliers to attend today’s event - and I am particularly pleased to see some of them here today and I am grateful for the leadership they are showing at the senior level in support of &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach to &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt;, even to a business as small as a one-man band, is to support, not stifle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="cde"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final word about &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;. Since its launch the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; has established a reputation for reaching out across a very wide spectrum of the engineering and scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; has worked closely with the Technology Strategy Board and benefited through working with its Knowledge Transfer Networks and Small Business Research Initiative and I am glad to see that Mark Glover from TSB is here today to see the blossoming fruits of this collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But above all else, it is you, the defence and security community, that shaped the advances that we see within in the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; today. Thank you for your strong support of the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; started off as pilot scheme. And four years on it has become a going concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But innovation never stops, there is always something new to try, something that can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now an exciting new phase has begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our White Paper ‘National Security through Technology’ committed Government to broaden &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;’s remit to cover both the defence and security domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 3rd October, here in this building, &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; held its first event for GCHQ and MI5. This attracted over 300 &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and resulted in over 170 proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘National Security through Technology’ also committed &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; to provide more support to &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; in understanding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how MOD and National Security operates &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the development of routes to market for potential defence and security products; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to enhance exploitation mechanisms between &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;, the wider MOD and our suppliers &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising fears expressed by &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; in the consultation, we committed to keep &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; small and agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am most grateful that Richard Brooks, the Programme Director for MOD’s Science and Technology Programme who is here organising this day, is ensuring that &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; is not distracted or inhibited by bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whilst staff numbers have grown, &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; remains small and agile with only 12 staff, yet now able to run more research calls, more seminars and more workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means that &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; can hold more regular surgeries - ‘one to ones’ - where individuals and companies can get personalised guidance on what the MoD is looking for, and practical help on how to pitch an idea to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; was set a target of 150 one-to-one appointments for this financial year. This figure will be passed before the end of this month and &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; now expects to hold more than 200 such appointments by the end of the financial year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="marketplace"&gt;Marketplace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our science and technology budget, we fund &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; to work on specific projects for us. They keep the intellectual property rights for their work, and can develop them however they want, once they have completed their project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the effort so far has been focussed on the engagement of &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and universities and supporting the best ideas with proof of concept funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we want to help more - which brings us, finally, to today’s Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all this event is a start, and I look forward to seeing this idea develop and innovate rapidly like all the best &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for those of you, &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt;, universities and Prime Contractors, who have contributed already to the thinking of how today’s Marketplace will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our aim is an MOD-facilitated initiative whereby &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; gives &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and universities, who have successfully demonstrated their credibility and capability, the opportunity to present their innovations and capabilities to the UK’s key defence suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing this opportunity, the MOD is seeking to ensure that these &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; will have an increased probability of development funding and mentoring, so that they can fully develop their ideas into products suitable for the defence, security or other civilian markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My view is that the MOD does have an important role to play in helping to maintain a dynamic pool of innovation which can drive defence applications forward and lead to economic benefits for the whole nation, beyond the immediate Defence objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we will only get this by leaving companies free to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And free to work together. So today is all about bringing people together. Then it is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to take a couple of questions before we move downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Town and Country Planning Association conference speech</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>This is a speech delivered by Planning Minister Nick Boles about beautiful urban landscapes and affordable homes.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;England is famous for the beauty of its landscapes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Yorkshire Dales to the South Hams, from the Weald of Kent to the Cumbrian Lakes, England glories in countryside of which generations of man and nature are joint authors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these landscapes - together with the greater drama of their Celtic cousins - that draw visitors to these islands.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these landscapes that our most popular institution and your sister organisation, the National Trust, was set up to preserve in perpetuity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of England is its finest asset and, for each of us, our most precious inheritance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a conservative in both name and spirit, as a West Country boy and a Lincolnshire MP, as the son of a former director general of the National Trust and the brother of 1 of its conservation managers, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that nothing would do more to improve the health and happiness of the British people than if more of them got to spend more of their lives surrounded by beauty.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beauty lifts, calms, excites, inspires.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is more intoxicating than any narcotic, more soothing than any therapy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Britain becomes more prosperous, we must insist that it becomes more beautiful as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the beauty we seek, and the landscapes we treasure, are not only to be found in our open spaces.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the loveliest scenery in Britain is to be found in our villages, cities and towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to take you on a journey, which starts in my constituency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, the river Welland has snaked its way through the low contours of Lincolnshire from its source in Northamptonshire’s Hothorpe Hills.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It enters Lincolnshire at the point where 4 counties meet and passes through countryside that is pleasant but hardly memorable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wandering painter or poet would not give this stretch of the Welland valley a second look, were it not for the landscape of Lincolnshire limestone that is the town of Stamford.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford is not just 1 of England’s most beautiful towns; it is 1 of its finest bits of scenery.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man-made. Built from stone and timber frames and slate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the aesthetic equal of our most splendid hills, lakes and rivers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where did this landscape come from?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did it spring fully formed from the mind of some 17th century master planner, the brainchild of a Lincolnshire Haussman?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford is, as the Royal Commission for Historic Monuments pronounced, ‘a town of discrete buildings’, each 1 unique. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earls of Exeter from nearby Burghley House provided long leases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the local community of wool, leather, cloth and hemp merchants, apothecaries and solicitors indulged themselves with a great variety of stone window surrounds, doorways, eaves, corner and chimney details.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did so within a broad set of rules set out in the London manuals of Rome educated James Gibbs but almost always used local architects and builders.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford was the spontaneous product of human initiative, haphazardly executed and totally unplanned, motivated by the desire for profit, the love of God and that age-old urge that keeps makeover shows in business, the desire to make your house nicer than your neighbours’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next stop is north of the border, in Great Britain’s first New Town.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, by contrast, was an example of municipal town planning at its boldest and most inspired.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to the economic stagnation into which Edinburgh had slipped after the Act of Union, in 1752 the Provost, George Drummond, launched an architectural competition to design a new cityscape of wide streets, crescents and squares, featuring symmetrical terraces of town-houses as well as purpose-built shops and public gardens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six year old James Craig won the competition and, in 4 stages between the 1760s and the 1850s, he, Robert Adam, William Chambers and William Playfair all stayed loyal to the original vision and developed their own variations on a Greek revival theme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In building their New Town, Edinburgh’s town councillors not only restored commercial and cultural vigour to Scotland’s capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also created 1 of the most beautiful landscapes in the British Isles.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who can resist the melancholy charm of a walk in the rain around Charlotte Square and through Ainslie Place? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would wager that the Facebook pages of recent visitors to Scotland contain at least as many photographs of Bute House and Moray Place as they do of Loch Lomond or Glencoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Stamford in the early 1600s, and in Edinburgh 150 later, beauty came about as a result of the natural human urge to get together with one’s neighbours to build a place in which it would be a pleasure to live and work, to raise a family and do business.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the same generous set of instincts that, another hundred and fifty years later, inspired Ebenezer Howard to build Letchworth Garden City. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I am skating on very thin ice telling members of the Town and Country Planning Association anything about the Garden City movement, when your association was founded to promote just that.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do want take a moment, as a layman, lacking all planning qualifications, to say why, like the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, I believe that we have so much to learn from Ebenezer Howard and his garden cities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genius of Letchworth, like so many of the most appealing towns and cities, lies as much in the spaces between the buildings as in the buildings themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By resisting the temptation to cram as many houses as possible onto the available land and adopting their golden rule of twelve houses to the acre, Letchworth’s architects, Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin allowed room for the organic intermingling of nature and architecture.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buildings are buttressed by front and back gardens, the roads are lined with broad verges and trees, the town is criss-crossed with footpaths and patchworked with allotments and parks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ebenezer Howard himself put it, “Parks and gardens, orchards and woods, are being planted in the midst of the busy life of the people, so that they can be enjoyed in the fullest measure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letchworth and the other garden cities work as living, breathing urban communities because, as an Ebenezer Howard put it, they combine “the advantages of the most energetic and active town life, with all the beauty and delight of the country.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the way most English people want to live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to find a way to build places like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what has been holding us back?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only been planning minister for a few months but I have observed the debate about housing and planning for over ten years and I think I know what is wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are trapped in a vicious circle.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People look at the new housing estates that have been bolted on to their towns and villages in recent decades and observe that few of them are beautiful.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, not to put too fine a point on it, many of them are pig-ugly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Harrisons Wharf in Purfleet that I visited last week.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure the flats inside are nice enough but they occupy an overbearing and unbroken slab of dismal brickwork that is an insult to the community it borders, cutting it off from a stretch of the River Thames which, in Victorian times, attracted day-trippers from London keen to take a pleasant walk along banks of the river.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since new housing estates are all too often soulless and formulaic, and those who will inhabit them will add to the pressure on local roads, primary school places and doctor’s appointments, existing residents oppose any proposal to build new houses on green field sites, even when the land is of low environmental quality.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities respond to the wishes of local voters by putting too few sites into their local plans. And this drives the cost of development land up to stratospheric levels (roughly £3 million an hectare in the South East and East of England by 2010.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers respond by stuffing as many units as they can onto any site and, in an attempt to make the properties affordable, skimp on room size, architectural features, vernacular materials, communal spaces and landscape design.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, because we don’t build beautifully, people don’t let us build much. And because we don’t build much, we can’t afford to build beautifully. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the coalition, and my personal mission as planning minister, is to help us break out of this vicious circle once and for all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to get back on to that confident, progressive path, which created Stamford, Edinburgh New Town and Letchworth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to build beautiful and affordable places once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have we done to bring this about? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles’ first step, in June 2010, was to scrap John Prescott’s blanket density target of 30 dwellings per hectare and to stop the garden grabbing that was destroying the precious green spaces that make Britain’s cities so pleasant to live in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government then embarked on a root and branch reform of the planning system and the creation of the National Planning Policy Framework. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a mammoth task which had to be masterminded by a minister with a mammoth brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, my predecessor, Greg Clark, is blessed with exactly that - as well as the unfailing patience and politeness required to bring the good ship Reform to dock with most of those interested in planning and development still on board.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Planning Framework establishes a few clear principles, which it is now my job to drive through.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That local councils should take charge of development in their areas by drawing up local plans.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that alongside the power to plan comes the responsibility to provide new houses to meet people’s aspirations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through their local plans, councils must bring forward enough land to meet the objectively assessed housing needs of their area over the next 5 years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they do so, they will be able to protect precious open spaces against speculative development.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Secretary of State and I will back them to the hilt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if they fail to take their responsibilities seriously, the presumption in favour of sustainable development will fill the vacuum and make the vital decisions that they are ducking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the Framework, Grant Shapps introduced the New Homes Bonus, which gives local councils additional money for every new home for which they give planning permission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in what I believe will turn out to be our most revolutionary step, the government launched neighbourhood planning through which villages, parishes and other neighbourhoods can take control of their future and decide for themselves how and where development should take place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be talking more about our ambitions for neighbourhood plans after the Autumn Statement.
So the government has acted to ensure that more land is brought forward for development and that local communities have an incentive to welcome new housing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now for planners, architects and developers, large and small, to seize the opportunity we have created and start designing beautiful places, which local people will welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, on the edge of Bishops Castle in Shropshire, Bob Tomlinson and Carole Salmon set out to create a new, contemporary village, a friendly place that people would want to live.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was The Wintles, 1 of the most exciting and enchanting collection of new houses anywhere in England.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The houses are all different.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are unashamedly contemporary but incorporate vernacular features in a bold and imaginative way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They use a wide range of both natural and manufactured materials and make a priority of the spaces between the buildings (both private and communal) and the planting of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wintles did not get everything right first time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which experiment ever does?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not as integrated into the rest of Bishops Castle as some long-standing residents would like. And, to replicate it on a large scale, one would need to find a way to build houses that are just as beautiful and just as sustainable but cost less to build.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Bishops Castle I believe that the Living Village Trust created a model for our future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of which Ebenezer Howard would be proud.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In which, once again, we build beautiful new urban landscapes full of affordable houses surrounded by green spaces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be our goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Community Budgets</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to the National Community Budgets Conference.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I don’t want to talk about the ins and outs of community budgets, or the finer points of cost benefit analysis. I want to talk about their impact on people’s lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about why it’s a scandal that agencies in Doncaster, faced with more than 100 events involving children, failed to co-ordinate any realistic attempt to prevent what happened in the Edlington case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about why so few children are getting their teeth checked in parts of Newcastle, that more and more are ending up having emergency treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about why in West Cheshire 1 woman faced 30 incidents of domestic abuse before feeling able to turn to an agency that might help her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to talk about my own area, Essex, and why some people still feel able to let a young father from that neck of the woods get caught up in a Kafkaesque nightmare - “Meeting upon meeting with different organisations” - just to get a bit of support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that these are the types of service failure that the pilots themselves are addressing. Because if these initiatives were just about money, we’d rightly be accused of a lack of ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, we’re all having to live with less. And, given the waste, given the inefficiency, given the duplication that went on before, the purpose of this is to use less to deliver a better service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wasn’t just looking for these pilots to just patch things up. To mend and make do. To think about ‘service improvement’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="people-at-the-centre-of-the-system"&gt;People at the centre of the system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted them to put people at the heart of the system and get to the root cause of entrenched problems. Even if that means throwing away the rule book and starting again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m glad to see that is what has been happening. The tri-borough initiative - part of the Whole-Place pilots - is proposing to reduce unplanned admissions to hospital. Putting the donkey work into helping older people with longer term conditions before they get to an acute stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got the greater Manchester pilot working with parents of children at risk so they don’t pass on the bad habits likely to hold kids back for the rest of their lives. The idea to ensure kids get a fresh start and can stand at the school gates on their first day ready with great excitement to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve got pioneers in West Cheshire making sure families with complex needs now have an advocate who’s going to stick with them through thick and thin. Instead of an average of 68 separate interventions per family at a staggering cost to the taxpayer of up to £92,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our pilots have discovered that if you simply follow the money you’ll usually find different cash flowing through different pipes to different agencies with different targets. But we’ve worked out, if you get people together in a room - if you focus on the elderly and the vulnerable, the troubled families, the re-offenders, the long-term unemployed and all those with dependencies - you can usually start taking dependence out the system. You can actually begin to help people recover their sense of self-worth so they can lead independent lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’re going to keep working with these 4 areas to make sure our plans really are do-able.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s why we’re going to help other areas to learn from their experience. We know our colleagues across government are up to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the way we’ve managed to bridge the old Whitehall, local government, voluntary sector fault lines has been one of the great success stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier on today we heard Norman Lamb speak about the pilot’s positive approach to health and social care integration. And we’re working with the Treasury, Work and Pensions, Education, Home Office and the Ministry of Justice to ensure we’re all on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="neighbourhoods-on-track"&gt;Neighbourhoods on track&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also know, as we’ve heard today, that our neighbourhood community budgets are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Ilfracombe to Haverhill they’re making sure their communities are involved in making the most of their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, local folk are backing them. 89% of people surveyed in Poplar felt citizens should ‘do their bit’. While more than half wanted to be involved in turning their neighbourhood around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we’re seeing community budgets turning their irrepressible energy, their boundless enthusiasm, to that eternal question of reducing waste. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ilfracombe, for example, knows that nationally an estimated £300 million per year of NHS money is wasted through over prescription of medication. Imagine all those pills and potions sitting in the cupboard never being taken away. So Ilfracombe is tracking down that waste with the help of its local people to stop the rot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because what’s driving Ilfracombe, what’s driving us all is the priceless prize for getting this right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just savings of millions of pounds, but hearing from the young girl of the father in Essex I mentioned earlier talking about how she’s been; “changed… around”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing from the man who’d fallen on hard times describe how, by becoming a mentor, he now has; “something to get up for to make him feel better about himself that he is helping others”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is more than money. It is the prize. And the prize relates to people. There’s a real opportunity here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said it was brave, fool hardly, silly even, to try this. They said it was bound to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’ve been really impressed with how all the different organisations have risen to the challenge. We’ve always known these problems existed. Now we have the chance to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what fires you up and me up and Bob up is not the cost benefit analysis. It is the fact we can make a difference to people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a noble cause. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is not just a case of government knows best. People must understand they too have a sense of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So don’t lose that fire in your belly. Be innovative, be bold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and I can make a difference. And together you and I will set us on course to make a difference for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Community budgets conference</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>This is a speech delivered by Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis on early intervention pilots and neighbourhood community budgets.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome. It’s great to see so many people from right across the local authority spectrum here today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the issues we’re discussing couldn’t be more pressing. In fact, they go to the very heart of why we entered public life in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="complex-issues-require-local-responses"&gt;Complex issues require local responses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the one thing I have learned as a local councillor and as an MP is that in every local area you will find a complex cauldron of issues requiring a sophisticated local response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in my old patch of Essex, they’re wrestling with the increasing demands of an elderly population on overstretched hospitals and care homes. But they’re also wondering how to address the rise in re-offending and domestic violence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, up the other end of the country, in West Cheshire, they are looking to deal with persistent pockets of long-term unemployment, and low-economic activity. And they too are having to face down the problems of domestic violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-pilots"&gt;The pilots&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our pilots were set up precisely to address these entrenched, many sided issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know these are the sorts of things governments have been talking about tackling since the year dot. But the point is our pioneers are actually involved in something radically different from what’s gone before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the old days, we grew used to the man from the ministry dipping into his ever diminishing bag of tricks and pulling out another quango. We got used to broad brush, one-size fits all solutions - which actually suited nobody. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we ended up with were ill-thought through, inefficient and unnecessarily expensive, public service silos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw cash funnelled to places that were most likely getting funds from another quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw, in Essex’s case, the proliferation of services - a staggering array of eighty agencies and over 116 phone numbers offering services to victims of domestic abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we witnessed inequality, lack of access - a society less free, less fair and less united. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m no actuary but when I heard that some London boroughs spend more than £25,000 on an individual with serious health conditions and less than £300 on those with minor health conditions, I sense a problem…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="example-of-the-problem-west-cheshire"&gt;Example of the problem: West Cheshire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, you only really get a sense of the problem when you start to consider the people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s consider the experience of one woman from West Cheshire. For the sake of her privacy let’s call her Jane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane’s husband has been going through a difficult time since he lost his job and he’s started drinking. One day Jane calls the police and reports her husband for hitting her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as her GP knows, this isn’t the first time it’s happened. It’s the 30th. And, shockingly, that’s not untypical. Nationally it takes on average 34 incidents before domestic abuse is reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s no coincidence that (in West Cheshire) £1.2 million is spent by GPs on managing the consequences of domestic abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the story. The police assess Jane’s husband as a standard risk and order him to stay away. But within days he’s back. Smashing down the front door, putting Jane in hospital and later finding himself in prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="west-cheshire-the-solution"&gt;West Cheshire: the solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now West Cheshire realised the tragedy of this situation, was that it could have been avoided. They found that almost all of the £20 million spent on dealing with its 9,000 cases of domestic abuse was reactive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thanks to a subtle rewiring of the system they will now make sure Jane doesn’t have to end up in a hospital bed before anyone raises the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-will-they-be-doing-differently"&gt;What will they be doing differently?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they’ve recognised prevention is better than cure. So they’ve developed a volunteer outreach programme providing mentoring support. It’s made up of people who have been through what Jane’s been through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, they’ve understood that local people can easily get bewildered by the many different “front doors” agencies. So they are ensuring Jane has a single point of contact. Someone to work with her whole family to join up the dots. That way Jane will speak to the right people at the right time to get the support she needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thirdly, West Cheshire have made sure all relevant local services are in on the act. The police, local authorities, GPs and voluntary services all working together. So Jane will get beefed up security. While her husband will be made to face up to his actions and helped with his broader drinking problems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering in this way will make a real difference to the whole family and at the same time it will save the public purse £17 million over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="local-people-at-the-heart-of-the-system"&gt;Local people at the heart of the system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s key to West Cheshire, to its fellow pilots, to the whole of our open public service reform programme - of which these initiatives form an integral part - is that they put local people at the heart of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People’s lives are complicated enough. We don’t need to make things even more confusing. What we do need to do is reduce dependency and give individuals a greater sense of independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know our services would be better if they were more responsive to local peoples’ needs, better serving the people that pay for them and use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, different areas work best when you, our public sector leaders are unconstrained. What’s more, free people up to innovate and they come up with ingenious, inventive solutions to complex, previously unsolved problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the magic of this approach is that it will save money. Lots of it. Greater Manchester alone, for example, reckons that improving its early years service will save £215 million over the next couple of decades for each year-group of children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radical? Revolutionary? Perhaps. But isn’t it also plain common sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty more I could say about the pilots. About how they’ve got eight Whitehall departments working hand in glove with local authorities. About how we’ve taken civil servants out of their ivory tower and parachuted them into the places where the problems lie. About how we’ve managed to get people from all the relevant services, in a room, round a table, talking. But actually I hope you’ll use today to find out more for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="community-budgets"&gt;Community budgets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I’d like to turn to another group of pioneers. I’m talking, of course, about our neighbourhood community budgets. Now these are only part way through their work, yet the signs are already encouraging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White City, has established that around £40 million is spent on services in their neighbourhood from housing and employment to welfare benefits and adult social care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it remains one of the most deprived areas of Hammersmith and Fulham with high levels of unemployment and crime, low educational attainment and high mortality rates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now local providers and residents are sitting down together to redesign local services. At long last we’re making progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Ilfracombe, in Devon, is developing an innovative virtual bank that shows local people the annual public sector investment in the town and what they are getting for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What better way to encourage local people to take the big decisions that affect their area?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our Whole-Place and neighbourhood pilots are showing us the way forward. Helping us rethink how we’ve always done things. Showing us the merit of going back to the drawing board, following the money and working together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t expect we will find all the answers here today. But this isn’t about looking for new panaceas or new wonder cures for every one of our country’s ills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about using innovation and imagination to make the most of what we’ve got. And if you’ve ideas and thoughts on what else we can do and where we can go next, I’m all ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The value of parishes</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to the National Association of Local Councils (NALC) Larger Councils' conference.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently JK Rowling’s new novel doesn’t paint parishes in a flattering light. It’s as fictional as the boy wizard himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we love our parish people. You are localism’s magic wand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Local Government Act of 1894, you’ve been providing unrivalled help, to the smallest of villages, the largest of towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the principles you embody are hardwired into the social DNA of every hometown, every village, in every era of our history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because you care about your areas, because you are rooted in the places you love, you are prepared to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="good-works---floods-and-jubilee"&gt;Good works - floods and Jubilee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent days, as floods have drenched our towns, we’ve seen parishes, from Oxford to Devon, coming to the rescue again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laying sandbags, battening down the hatches, working with police and fire crews, doing everything they can to save their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in this great year of the Jubilee, we’ve seen parishes, stepping into the spotlight, organising Big Lunches and street parties, helping the celebrations go with a swing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, wherever I find a new parish in a rural or urban area, like Queen’s Park in Westminster, I cheer it to the rafters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because our local services are at their best when they are run by local people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me say to &lt;abbr title="National Association of Local Councils"&gt;NALC&lt;/abbr&gt;, that the role you continue to play, championing local people, ensuring their voice resounds loud and clear in the corridors of power, is absolutely vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="putting-parishes-in-charge"&gt;Putting parishes in charge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we all know parishes, have the credibility to lead their communities. So we’ve made sure you’re calling the shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve cut through the jungle of red tape that tied you up in knots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve scrapped the Standards Board that summed up everything that was wrong with local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of wasting taxpayers money on petty squabbles, we’re letting the sunlight of transparency shine through. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Localism requires local accountability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some councillors are concerned about publishing their business interests. The names of their spouses. Pictures of their pet goldfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as our light-touch guidance explains, only one of the above has to be on record. I won’t tell you which one. That might spoil the surprise. But here’s a clue - it’s just common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for bullies and liars, they must expect the full force of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, local people should trust the public. You put decent people in and if they get it wrong they don’t get elected next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call it minimalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-powers-new-rights"&gt;New powers, new rights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standards Board apart, we’ve also got rid of the childish power of well being which died a death every 4 years. And we’ve given you the General Power of Competence instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils can now do anything an individual can do unless it’s specifically ruled out. These days you don’t have to get things signed-off in triplicate, if you want to, for example, back community composting, or transform a village pub into a wi-fi hotspot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of competence means you’re only limited by your imagination and your ingenuity. And when it is combined with new community rights - that let you bid to control local services like street cleaning or step in to save a much love community asset like the local pub - the implications are far reaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, some parishes will need training in the art of power. But no need to dust down your copies of Sun Tzu’s ‘The Art of War’. Just log onto the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://mycommunityrights.org.uk/"&gt;my community rights website&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="neighbourhood-planning"&gt;Neighbourhood planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I strongly suspect, the more power you grab, the more power you’re going to want. That’s why we’ve also introduced neighbourhood planning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the slim-line National Planning Policy Framework, the days of wasting time on the amount of projection of a window are gone. So too the pettifogging bureaucracy and the master planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve put local people at the heart of the system. So they get to decide where new homes, new shops and new offices should go. And which green spaces to protect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your chance to remould your area in your own image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="frontrunners"&gt;Frontrunners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our neighbourhood frontrunners are already blazing a trail in Upper Eden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seventeen parishes are beavering away in the most sparsely populated area of the country to provide housing for farmers and rural businesses. They’re hoping to hold the first ever neighbourhood plan referendum in March. I can’t wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also pretty excited about what’s going on in the City to Ripon - where they’re working out how to allocate land for 160 homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="over-to-you---the-precept"&gt;Over to you - the precept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve thrust genuine power into the hands of local people. Now it’s over to you to get your parish in order; to build proper neighbourhoods, to choose activism not nimbyism. And to make sure you’re not overburdening hard working folk with increased taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hasn’t escaped my noticed that, at a time when most districts are freezing their council tax, the average parish precept has gone up by 3%. And the trend is seeing parish increases outstripping the rest of local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made it clear. We would look at again at the council tax referendum principles. But, as a general rule of thumb what you really need to ask yourself is this; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can you square any rise with your electorate? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can you really look your local folk in the eye?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have you really done everything you can to manage your resources, work with others, make the most of what you’ve got…?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="neighbourhood-budgets"&gt;Neighbourhood budgets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last point is critical because if there is one thing neighbourhood budgets have shown it’s the advantage of looking beyond your borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in Ilfracombe in North Devon where they’re digitally mapping their resources. Or Haverhill in Suffolk where they are bringing local business and public agencies together to equip young people with the skills local businesses need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know where to begin my department is here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re proud of our parishes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re out there in your communities revolutionising public services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing your civilising influence to bear on all around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve given you the power but now we’re looking for you to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So be vigorous, be innovative, be independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all never forget the people you serve and you won’t go far wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Inter Faith Week and A Year of Service speech</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>This is a speech delivered by Faith Minister Baroness Warsi on interfaith action and identity.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to thank you all for coming to this a wonderful event, marking both Inter Faith Week and A Year of Service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks also to the Faith-based Regeneration Network, Mitzvah Day, the Co-exist Foundation and others for their help in making the event a reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, for the people here, it’s Inter Faith Week every week and it’s A Year of Service every year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because day in, day out, you are giving your time, your energy, your hearts and your souls to making your communities better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United by faith and driven by faith - whichever faith that may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the Sikh-run Nishkam Centre in Birmingham, which provides a whole range of training and educational opportunities for local people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Sewa Day, which inspires Hindus across the country to acts of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like the St Vincent de Paul Society, which provides gifts and hospitality to the needy in the run-up to Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These projects and many more prove that faith motivates good works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today you have a government that doesn’t deny that fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a government that supports, celebrates and - in my case - shares that motivation. A government that does God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we know that people who ‘do God’ do good things up and down the country every single day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveys show people of religious observance are more likely to become volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we see that fact in the 30,000 faith-based charities making a difference throughout Britain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="interfaith-action"&gt;Interfaith action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the interfaith movement officially started in 1893 with the ‘World’s Parliament of Religions’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the world’s major religions came together in Chicago for serious discussions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays I don’t think they would have a parliament; they’d have a day of social action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because today interfaith dialogue has become much more about interfaith action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always argued that interfaith shouldn’t just be tea in a draughty church hall or a samosa in the local mosque between the imam and the vicar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t just be clergy to clergy: it should be congregation to congregation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why I helped get a programme called Active Faith off the ground - which, of course, became Near Neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the wonderful projects we see here today are just a small selection of the 300 local projects that have been supported so far.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producing projects like the Departure Café, a drop-in centre and community hub for Tower Hamlets, which I hope to visit soon.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of local congregations coming together to ‘do their bit’ underpin our support for the A Year of Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’ll agree - there can be no better way of marking Her Majesty the Queen’s many years of service to our country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Year of Service has produced some fantastic projects, like the wonderful Mitzvah Mummies, who I went to see yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mothers and their toddlers, meeting, talking to and sharing moments with residents of a retirement home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integenerational interaction - such a simple idea and so effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Minister for Faith and Communities, every day I see the power and the potential of interfaith action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take last Thursday as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a catch-up with the Chief Rabbi… A meeting with Christian groups… An introduction with the Buddhist Network… A speech at my department’s Eid event… And a House of Lords debate on the importance of religion in society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the common thread running through these events wasn’t the fact these people observed a faith. It was that they were inspired to do good things as a result of their belief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why I’m so proud that we have so many local and national 300 inter faith organisations in the UK - more than any other country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why I’m so proud that 3 Faiths Forum, the Joseph Interfaith Foundation, the Christian-Muslim Forum are leading the way in the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s why I am so heartened to see the launch this week of advice to couples and families on interfaith marriages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="stronger-identities"&gt;Stronger identities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had my own theory on inter faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that if you are stronger in your identity then you are more tolerant of others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who don’t associate with people of other beliefs because they think it somehow weakens theirs - they have got it the wrong way round. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if you’re a person who unites with people of other faiths for a common goal - it doesn’t make you less of a Muslim, less of a Hindu, less of a Jew - it makes you more of one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there is no more powerful demonstration of one’s security in one’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I went to the Vatican earlier this year and argued that Europe should be stronger in its Christian identity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Christian heritage of Britain is what has made me feel comfortable here in practising my faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending my daughter to an Anglican convent school made her feel stronger in her identity. When she would swap ‘Amen’ for ‘Ameen’ during the Lord’s Prayer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-future"&gt;The future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain leads the world in its interfaith ethos. But I think we can build on the progress we’ve made since that conference in American back in 1893. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that if we - people of all faiths and none - pull together, we can defeat the intolerance and bigotry faced by people of faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve said before, an attack on a mosque is an attack on a church; an attack on a gudwara is an attack on a synagogue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, an attack on one faith is an attack on all faiths. So let’s be inspired by the story of Siavosh Derakhi, who has recently been recognised for founding Young Muslims Against Anti-Semitism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be inspired by the words of President Obama, following the release of the abhorrent, gratuitously offensive ‘Innocence of Muslims’ film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he said: “to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see when the image of Jesus Christ is desecrated, churches are destroyed, or the Holocaust is denied. Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims, and Shia pilgrims.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be inspired by all the good things that are done and can be done in the name of faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on the subject of inspiration I want to present this beautiful piece of artwork.
Doctor Fox, I know you’re accepting this on behalf of the Evelina Hospital, so thank you, and also to the extremely talented artist Sam Cowan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m off to see some more fantastic artwork now as I go and award the winner of the Faith Through a Lens competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me once again thank you for coming today and thank you for all you do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Transport Scotland high speed rail summit</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Video speech by Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport Norman Baker.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2gEnT-LreI&amp;amp;feature=share&amp;amp;list=UU8mgf88hO4bbrfta9bcgZuA"&gt;Transport Scotland high speed rail summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transcript"&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello and thank you for the opportunity to put on record coalition government’s commitment to high speed rail, and its determination that all parts of our country, including of course Scotland, should benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing demand for inter-city rail travel is putting increasing pressure on existing infrastructure. Without planning for additional capacity, passengers face the prospect of increasingly crowded and more unreliable services. To be clear, the primary, though not the only, justification for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a clear need for extra capacity north to south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans for a high speed rail network from London to the West Midlands and on to Leeds and Manchester will be the backbone of a new transport system for the 21st century.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2026, Phase 1 of High Speed 2 will link London and Birmingham. Comfortable trains travelling at 225 miles per hour will cut the journey time to just 45 minutes, compared to the 84 minutes it currently takes. Importantly for Scotland, the first phase of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will provide connections to the existing network at Birmingham, and also link &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; to &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt;, opening up the opportunities for through trains to run from Scotland to Paris and Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completion of the Y network to Leeds and Manchester will further spread the benefits of high speed rail across the country, increasing capacity and enhancing connectivity all the way to Scotland by relieving pressure on the most congested southern end of the line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition agreement makes it clear that our ultimate goal is a genuinely national network, with high speed services from London to the Midlands and the north, including Scotland. We see phases one and two of the High Speed 2 project as the best way to make progress towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport ministerial team is very much engaged in the question of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; as it affects and, indeed, benefits Scotland. I visited Glasgow last year, the former Secretary of State went in March this year, and the current Secretary of State intends to visit later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last month we announced the launch of a study on ways to get fast journeys further north and to Scotland, making sure that the north-east benefits too. The aim is to fully understand and articulate transport needs in Scotland and the north of England, setting out the remit for any future work, using completion of the ‘Y’ network as a starting point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study won’t start with any preconceptions but will be open to all options that offer good value for money to the taxpayer. This may include a full high speed solution, upgrades to existing infrastructure, or a combination of the two.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands today the network is expected to deliver up to £50 billion of business benefits alone and that will be felt very much in Scotland and the north of England as well as the South. The claim by some opponents of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; that better and faster transport links between north and south will see economic activity pulled into London and away from the UK’s other great cities is defeatist and misguided, and out of line with public opinion. The further north you go, the louder are the voices in support of high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing Edinburgh and Glasgow closer to London as well as the cities of the midlands and the north of England will undoubtedly boost growth across all of our major conurbations. That confidence is based on the evidence from our European neighbours, who began their high speed rail journey a generation before we had even started arguing about our first 67 mile stretch of high speed track from the channel tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With passengers enjoying faster journeys, there has been more extensive modal shift between rail and air as the train becomes the mode of choice for more travellers. High speed rail is already greener than flying and the gap between the two modes will widen as we make progress in decarbonising the sources of our electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will benefit every type of traveller, not just on the new network, but on existing lines too, freeing up more space and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, not only will high speed rail help boost the Scottish economy and support thousands of jobs in Scotland and throughout the UK, it gives us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the economic geography of the whole country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever way you look at it, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a national scheme in the national interest driven by a national government. Realising the full benefits of high speed rail for Scotland is crucial to the economic wellbeing of the whole country, and I can assure you we will continue to work very closely with our partners in Scotland to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title> Heart of the Community conference 2012</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by Local Growth Minister Mark Prisk to the Association of Convenience Stores.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to be able to join you at this, my third Association of Convenience Stores conference, though I don’t think that earns me a Crackerjack pen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would like to pay tribute to James Lowman and the work of the Association. Whilst we have not always agreed, I have always found James to be both persistent and effective, in putting your case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it was following talks with James that I pressed for, and secured, a 3 year moratorium for small shops from the tobacco display ban, (much to the chagrin of the supermarket groups!). This was partly because of the points James made on how a convenience store is run, so his knowledge is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tough-times"&gt;Tough times&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that I recognise as someone who has been involved with business, and the government recognises, that these are tough times for retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer incomes are under continuing pressure. The uncertainty in the Eurozone has prolonged the credit crunch. And of course there is increasing competition, which only squeezes your already tight margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, alongside the established competition from the supermarkets and out of town centres, we are also seeing a long term shift in consumer habits, as the online market grows. In fact, I was looking at the numbers and online sales have doubled in the last decade, to make up 10% of UK retail sales. That trend is only going to continue, and begs real challenges for all of you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift in consumer habits is not wholly bad for smaller bricks and mortar retailers. Indeed it has been shown to actively help specialists or those with a particular offer to reach much wider markets. But it means that the question for all retailers is no longer whether you should adapt your business, but how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very important shift which we in government must respond to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="value-of-convenience-sector"&gt;Value of convenience sector&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In government, we recognise the economic worth of the retail sector, both by turnover and measured by the number and type of jobs. Retailing is, for example, one of the most important ‘first’ employers, with a third of all retail employees, aged under 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is also a social value in small shops, (and particularly in the convenience sector) which we should not ignore, as indeed your research has shown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A local convenience store is often one of the few places, where people meet and talk today. In villages and on many estates, it’s you and it’s your staff who know the local community, (and make time to talk to the elderly.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representing 40% of all rural shops (and a third of shops in our towns), it’s the convenience sector which is usually there for a whole range of customers - perhaps those who don’t have a car, for young families, and for the elderly. It’s not to say that you aren’t economically important, but I also recognise the social benefit of a diverse, convenience sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, both as a constituency MP and as a member of Parliament, as well as a user of my local convenience store, and on behalf of the many customers who rely on the service and care you and your staff provide, let me say thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-can-be-done-to-help"&gt;What can be done to help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a former businessman, I understand that of course empathy doesn’t pay your bills, or help you compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I would like to do if I can, is explain what we’re doing in government to help business generally, and retailing in particular, to weather the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I think it’s important that we have been able to keep interest rates lower for substantially longer, by cutting the financial deficit by a quarter. The fact that we’ve been able to do this over the last 2 and a half years is vital. Clearly, there’s a difference between what we the government and you as retailers can borrow, but if we had continued to borrow, interest rates would have soared, crippling businesses and families alike. We can all see what that means, when we look abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So low interest rates have helped. But the government has also acted to cut your costs. We have cut corporation tax rates to 24 pence for larger firms, and to 20 pence for smaller businesses. And we have reversed plans to increase National Insurance contributions, which would have hit jobs hard. The Association of Convenience Stores were amongst those who helped to make that point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we came into office, we also acted to help cut business rate bills. It’s why we extended and doubled the small business rates relief that’s helped thousands of small shops pay their bills, and it’s why we have now given councils new powers to discount rates, (funded locally), to help those firms which are struggling. It’s a new power, only a few months old, and only a few councils have taken it up. I am sure the association will want to change that. In fact, your own submission to the Treasury says that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s there, now all they need to do is use it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, our financial room for manoeuvre is very limited but we are listening carefully to your concerns and will try and help where we can. However, as I’d like to remain a minister, I won’t pre-empt the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently we have delayed the planned revaluation from 2015 to 2017. This is an important issue. Let me explain our thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we know that the last thing businesses needed right now, is the uncertainty which a revaluation would create. You get your valuation, there’s the counter valuation, appeals which leads to 18 months of uncertainty. It isn’t the right time to be doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we looked carefully at the independent evidence produced by the Valuation Office Agency as to who the likely winners and losers would be. We were and you might be surprised by the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Valuation Office Agency’s analysis shows that some 800,000 premises would have seen a real term increase in their rates bill, with roughly 300,000 benefitting. Indeed many of the businesses represented here would have seen big hikes, in some cases up to 28%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems counter-intuitive, but the reason for this, is that because the revaluation must be revenue neutral, to compensate for lower rateable values, the tax rate would have to increase by approximately 20%. As a result, many businesses whose rents have fallen by less than the national average, which is how it is balanced, would have seen business rate bill goes up from 2015. We have asked business to come in so that we can explain how this works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we felt, on balance, that now is not the time to be making this revaluation and in doing so we believe we can help many businesses in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that for many people, they think, ‘my rents have gone up’ but because there are 2 elements to business rates it doesn’t quite work like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="town-centres-need-to-compete"&gt;Town centres need to compete&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not just individual shops that need help. It’s also the traditional high street and many of our town centres. And our role should not be not to protect, but to enable. To ensure that our high streets are able to adapt to changing markets and consumer habits, so you can compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why last year the Prime Minister asked Mary Portas to review what needs to be done, by government, by local authorities and by business itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has produced an excellent report and brought her typical real energy and a keen consumer eye to the towns wanting to pilot this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s actually happening on the ground?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, our Town Centres First policy is an important and explicit part of our new National Planning Policy Framework. What it means in practice is that town centres should be the first preference for new retail outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we want to reform, planning to help town centres adapt. This means making it easier for the conversion of redundant first floors into homes, and secondly to enable empty offices that can often blight some high streets to also be converted into homes. Both these measures will bring people back into the town centre, increase footfall and so help existing retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, we believe that strong local leadership is vital if towns are to be renewed. That is the clear lesson from both the Portas pilots and what we see regularly from successful shopping centres, who manage the whole customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If struggling high streets and town centres are to compete, they need the right people to deal with the promotion, management and coordination of their ‘centre’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why we announced last month the creation of over 320 town team partners, who will get the expert advice, mentoring and support they need, to get an effective business plan in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently went to Deptford, where I met the leaders of their town team, who are using one-stop shops and community cafés to make the most of what they feel is their unique selling point - its significant cluster of local artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuacApa2aUE"&gt;Deptford visit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They plan to bring benefits to the entire high street, install art in the high street and set up shops as galleries under the ‘Made in Deptford’ banner to bring more people in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really encouraging visit and just shows what together local civic and business leaders working as a partnership can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="physical-change"&gt;Physical change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course if towns are to compete, they need to address other issues than those I mentioned: from actively promoting local markets; through to being innovative, when managing and charging for local parking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, lets be honest many need to change their appearance. And getting empty shops occupied is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why my predecessor Grant Shapps provided a £10 million High Street Innovation Fund, specifically to help those areas with the worst levels of empty shops. We’re already starting to see this helping to bring run down shops back into use, with other businesses kicking off as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think we can do more. The pop up shop movement, which helps new businesses set up and sell, is a great idea. Its something I want to impress on both landlords and tenants, and see expand right across the country, not least as it helps new firms start and will generate additional footfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why I am in talks with the Pop Up Britain team, led by Emma Jones, to see how we in government can help promote pop up shops across the country, and I hope to have something positive to say about it very shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-next-step"&gt;The next step&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I hope you can see, as a government we believe that much can be done to help retailers and our town centres compete. But it has to be a collaborative effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government, councils, businesses and local people (especially) need to be engaged and feel that they can make a difference. This involves a long term shift and short term squeeze. This won’t be easy and many towns will struggle, especially where that sense of collaboration is missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it can be done. As the people in Deptford have shown, if there’s the right imagination, will and support our high streets can have a great future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be different to what went before, but it’s vital that once again our town centres regain their role, at the heart of our communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>National Empty Homes conference 2012</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by Don Foster to the annual National Empty Homes conference.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1990, Rachel Whiteread won international recognition for her cast of an empty room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a striking piece. Conveying the sadness, the sheer tragedy of an unoccupied place - a place with no one to call it home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significantly, the artist’s name for that work was ‘Ghost’ and that really is the point. Homes are not pieces of sculpture. They are made to be occupied. An &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/empty-homes"&gt;empty home&lt;/a&gt; is a phantom. A hole in the heart of a community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we know homes fall empty for all sorts of reasons. Some are renovated, some in probate, some are even second homes. But, wherever you find these haunted houses you’ll find blighted communities and lost neighbourhoods. Ambition abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all seen how it happens. The empty edifice becomes an eyesore. The eyesore becomes a magnet for rats, vandals, drug dealing, squatters and prostitution. Neighbours are inconvenienced. Communities are damaged. Council and local emergency services stretched to breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics prove the point. Research by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests properties adjoining poorly maintained empty properties can drop by almost 20% in price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in part we were reaping the whirlwind of the failed policies of the past. The destructive Pathfinder programme undermined once vibrant communities. Marooning people in appalling homes surrounded by a sea of derelict streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the legacy we’ve inherited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A legacy of almost three quarters of a million empty homes abandoned to the winds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re determined to say never again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to inhabit the absences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plug the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring ghost homes back from the brink to the land of the living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we afford not to do it? It’s a moral and financial imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 1.7 million families on housing waiting lists. Of those some are homeless forced to live in overcrowded B&amp;amp;Bs. And the country’s population is growing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, house building is really important, vital, as the Deputy Prime Minister’s recent housing announcement made clear. But, as George Clarke would say, it would be “a crying shame” if we couldn’t occupy these wastes of space. Make use of what we’ve already got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the government’s approach has been threefold. First, we’re making more funds available for bringing homes back into use. And we’ve committed £160 million to bring over 11,000 empty houses back into use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about throwing money at a problem but making sure the money goes to the right places. Everyone who understands this area, knows there is no one-size fits all solution. Behind every empty home lies a myriad of social, historic and economic issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our approach must be to create local answers to local issues. Giving local communities the right incentives to take the lead. So they will no longer turn a blind eye. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than talk you through which fund comes from which pot, let me focus on the difference the money can make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Habitat for Humanity in Dagenham, received financial aid to bring 35 houses back into use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redcar &amp;amp; Cleveland Borough Council used its cash to renovate 20 homes and help unemployed residents to learn new skills for employment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developing Health Independence, out in my constituency in Bath, is bringing 18 properties back from the brink&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kingston upon Hull City Council has written to 500 owners of empty homes offering to resuscitate their property - more than three quarters have already said yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These organisations deserve all the praise they get. What can be better than giving someone a home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our approach is not all about money. It’s about keeping empty homes on the agenda. That’s the second point I’d like to make today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It used to be a case of out of sight out of mind. Often there are people who care passionately about the areas they live in but they haven’t a clue about what to do next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thanks to George - the fastidious work of the Charity Empty Homes, the grass roots activities of local authorities and registered providers, the passion of community groups - ghost homes now have nowhere to hide. We’re stopping the rot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, we’re taking the carrot and stick approach. There are now powerful incentives for all local authorities to tackle empty homes such as the New Homes Bonus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means local authorities can earn the same financial reward for bringing an empty home back into use as building a new one. And it has provided an income of £26 million to local authorities for bringing empty homes back into use over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what happens when advice and support isn’t enough? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those circumstances we’ll get tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to take action against individuals who just can’t be bothered, who refuse to see the problem, who feel it’s ok to abandon their homes to the elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve given local authorities the power to reduce or remove Council Tax relief for empty and unfurnished homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve allowed them local discretion to introduce a Council Tax premium on homes empty and unfurnished for more than 2 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From next April, billing authorities will be able to charge up to 150% of Council Tax on such property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the Empty Dwelling Management Orders. These force owners to bring their properties back into use. And, last but not least, as a last resort, there is the compulsory purchase order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point about these things is not how many times they are used but the fact they are there at all. They are a deterrent against those who refuse to take responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under our efforts these silent shells are vanishing before our eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we came to power the number of long term empty homes has fallen by 50,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This downward trend is continuing. The latest figures show a further decrease 20,000 in long term empty homes to 259,000 in 2012. And every house back in circulation, means a roof over the head of a working family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there is still a very long way to go. Yet what we’ve demonstrated emphatically is the power of collaborations. That it’s coalitions of organisations - registered social landlords and community groups, house builders and local authorities - that together will make the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These collaborations ensured the house in Oldham that stood empty for 14 years will soon be occupied. Oldham Borough Council and Aksa Homes brushed aside the cobwebs, hovered up the tumbleweed, rebuilt the pathways and put in new gates and fitted a new kitchen. A new home awakened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s absolutely vital we harness the wealth of skill, experience, knowledge and application that these partnerships bring. So today I am inviting councils, housing associations, community and voluntary groups, and high street regeneration groups, prioritising our 27 Portas pilots to step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange for a share of £300 million I want them to tell me their plans to scatter the shadow of empty homes and bring thousands more back into the light. You’re the experts and it’s your innovative ideas I’m after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final thing. I’m keen to take our empty homes policy in a new direction. This shouldn’t just be about turning disused residential properties, those ageing apparitions, into inviting homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not turn empty offices into homes? Why not use the spaces above shops for housing? People who need a place to live don’t mind where it comes from. We’re making this easier to do. We’ve already introduced a whole host of policies to get rid of the red tape that gets in the way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know this type of project can be more challenging than a residential refurbishment. Typically, there are obstacles such as access and security to overcome. But they mustn’t stand in our way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minute you occupy an empty home, you start of an amazing chain reaction of events. You don’t just bring homes back to life, but neighbourhoods and communities. And businesses and jobs follow in their wake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re determined to exorcise ghost homes from the collective psyche. We’re straining every sinew to make them a myth not the reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up and down the country, there are people who dream of one day seeing neighbourhoods revive and redundant homes come back to life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have little doubt, that working together, we will grant them their wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;**CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;RESPONSIBLE CAPITALISM  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;Introduction   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Good morning. It is no exaggeration to say the pensions industry is a lynchpin of the economy. Pension fund investments are a critical source of capital for UK companies, and potentially for infrastructure as well as savings vehicles.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, you hold over £150bn of UK equities. That figure illustrates the scale of your influence, but it goes much further than merely delivering returns to fund tomorrow’s pensions for today’s workers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careful husbandry over long timescales, a core duty for any pension fund, is an essential component in a system of responsible capitalism that encourages the pursuit of long-term value rather than short-run, sometimes illusory, returns.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would like to focus today on the work we are doing in government to support such a system - because it is clear we have a long way to go before we can say it exists.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equity investment has become increasingly complex and intermediated, with more and more links in the chain. As a result, the different players are often working to their own agendas and timescales to the detriment of long-term value creation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often, traders go after a quick buck rather than looking for sustainable returns based on sound stewardship of companies. Holdings are bought and sold to turn a short-term profit with no thought given to the underlying fundamentals.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phantom chase was at its most frantic in the financial markets, where banks took dross and sold it as gold. But that lack of responsibility - the failure to take calculated investment risks based on sound principles - is more widespread.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Capitalism  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**The issue of so called short-termism is part of a wider debate about capitalism and whether it should be constrained by a wider sense of responsibility. So, what do I mean by responsible capitalism? Let me explain by quoting Adam Smith, who said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.’  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Adam Smith himself was scathing about some forms of business behaviour - particularly those that led to the suppression of competition. He wrote “people of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realise that there some irony in using this particular quote in a speech to a trade association conference. But Smith’s conception of self-interest is distinct from the crude, material, selfishness we have seen. Elsewhere in his writings he discusses the notion of sympathy, or fellow feeling, and emphasises its importance. So Smith’s butcher or baker cannot pursue their self-interest and obtain what they want without also meeting the needs of the customer. .  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of self-interest is not inherently irresponsible: the desire to trade and profit produced meat, beer and bread in Smith’s day, and today has given us iPads, foreign holidays and life-saving drugs. What connects these things is their reliance on individuals acting in their own interests to deliver goods and services that benefit us all.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to reconcile Smith’s butcher, brewer and baker with the complexity of today’s capitalism. Indeed the modern public company with dispersed shareholder ownership did not exist at that time. But they would have recognised the key role that trust and confidence play in effective markets. Without them, no economy can function effectively.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen too many examples of irresponsible capitalism recently. Companies not paying their taxes. Employees making up the numbers or gambling the future of the entire company. Customers being sold complex products they neither need nor want. Managers helping themselves to lavish remuneration packages at the expense of customers, their shareholders and their workforce.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Roger Carr, the CBI’s President, acknowledged the problem at its annual conference on Monday. He said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…standards have been variable, greed prevalent and fairness forgotten in a number of sectors - banking and media at the forefront - but others from all walks of life showing signs of bad behaviour.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who found myself labelled “anti-business” for criticising the excesses of banking and media barons I empathise totally with Sir Roger. He, like me, is of course pro-business.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like many in this room and in business we share a sense of dismay at some recent behaviour. I believe the majority of businesses play by the rules, pay their taxes and contribute to the economy. Where they don’t, Government has a duty to intervene. But as owners, institutional investors have a major role in challenging and correcting this behaviour.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our task together is to reform the system in order that trust is restored because, without it, the capitalist system cannot function effectively.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are fundamental questions about why parts of the capitalist system have gone awry. At least part of the industry’s problem is one of distorted perspective - a prevailing focus on the short term at the expense of the long-term.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**The Kay Review   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**This was the supposition which led me to invite John Kay to look at this problem in the round. And he has subjected the UK’s equity markets to rigorous independent review with support from Sir John Rose, formerly of Rolls Royce, Chris Hitchen of Railpen and James Anderson of Baillie Gifford  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His findings amount to a compelling argument that today’s transactional cultures and the pursuit of short-term gains in financial markets are undermining the core responsibility of company directors and institutional investors to act as effective stewards of the assets they control.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-term pursuit of value creation has been crowded out by a focus on short-term gains.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company directors have a clear legal responsibility to make decisions with regard to the long-term. This is part of their duty to promote the success of the company. Engagement by investors needs to change to support directors to meet this responsibility. The focus should be aligned with the timescales of the company’s business model - which may be very long term.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the stewardship relationship must be based on an understanding of company fundamentals. That’s the best way to create an environment of trust and challenge, which enables those managing the company to take sound long-term decisions on investment and strategy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Kay found there is a particular problem in how the performance of active asset managers is currently measured. Faced with the need to deliver short-term performance, active asset managers will have an incentive to focus on what the market is doing - seeking to outperform other asset managers - rather than to engage with companies to understand and foster the creation of value.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So pension schemes and other asset holders need to issue clear mandates for active asset managers. They must set targets to achieve absolute returns that meet the needs of savers rather than just chasing the market.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That approach will send a strong signal that it’s time the short-termism ended and was replaced by a clear-sighted focus on long-term value creation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to John for his cogent analysis of the problems in the corporate sector. Today I am publishing the Government’s response to his review. It focuses on restoring relationships based on trust and confidence to the investment chain. The report has provoked constructive debate on many of the issues raised, and progress is being made on a number of the recommendations.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Financial Reporting Council has revised the Stewardship Code to give a sharper emphasis on long-term company strategy, reinforcing the message that engagement has to be more than a box-ticking exercise. Instead, it requires genuine dialogue with companies about the long-term prospects for growth.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are also recognising they need to engage collectively with companies. The review recommended an investor forum to maximise their influence, and there are encouraging signs that this will happen soon. I am happy to be a catalyst but it is not for government to create a new quango - a forum will only succeed if it is created and run by the investors it represents.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High on the to-do list for any forum is to tackle overly complex incentive schemes which encourage short-termism and tend to pay out asymmetrically. Some executives see spectacular rewards for good performance but there is no corresponding fall in pay when performance is poor.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Kay called on companies and asset managers to change their own practices. Our reforms to executive pay - including giving shareholders a binding vote on pay policy for the first time - will support this by empowering investors to engage more effectively with companies.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have come a long way in the last year. The shareholder spring has shown there is real appetite among shareholders to be much more challenging of unjustified pay awards.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucial factor is ensuring investors have the information they need to make long-term decisions, on pay and a range of other issues. John Kay was scathing about the effect of quarterly reporting on long-term investment. I agree with his analysis, and the government will work with our European counterparts to change the law so it is no longer required.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a challenge here too for asset owners, including pension funds, who need to look beyond quarterly performance to judge their managers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our narrative reporting reforms, to encourage better quality annual reports that put the numbers into context, will help. The new rules, which come into force next year, will make reports simpler, more relevant and more focussed on forward looking strategy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust is also the product of behaviour - a commitment to act with integrity and expect integrity from each other.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “Fiduciary duty” is used a lot in the debate on these issues, but it means different things to different people. We need clarity, with consistent standards of behaviour required throughout the investment chain.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today we are making it clear that all intermediaries should act in good faith in the long-term interests of clients or beneficiaries.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These standards should be universal and immutable. We need to achieve them by making sure that our regulatory framework supports them - but also by promoting them as behavioural norms in the investment industry.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we will ask the Financial Conduct Authority to consider whether their regulatory rules and approach support these standards and, where necessary, we will argue for changes to regulatory requirements at EU level.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are asking the Law Commission to conduct a review of the legal obligations on investment intermediaries seeking to act in their clients’ best interests - and to report back as soon as is practicable  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takeovers bring the discussion of duty and long-termism into particularly sharp focus. Company directors have a legal duty to promote the success of the company. A duty that requires that decisions be made with regard to the long-term consequences.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company directors must recommend that shareholders reject a bid if they believe that the transaction will destroy long-term value, or that the premium being offered does not reflect the fundamental value of the company. Directors must give their best advice to shareholders. Shareholders must then decide what to do.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owners and asset managers have a vital role here. In order to protect their long-term financial interests they must challenge management to explain the strategy and logic of large deals and provide robust, consistent push-back where they have concerns. Events continue to show it is as true for the shareholders in the bidding company as it is in the target.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that the Takeover Panel are carrying out a review of the impacts of last year’s changes to the Takeover Code. I look forward to seeing their findings, and their assessment of the progress that has been made.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the light of the debate around takeovers in the wake of the Kraft acquisition of Cadbury, I was anxious to ensure that takeover activity should be subject to greater transparency over fee incomes, and that rules should not play into the hands of short-term speculative investors. I therefore welcomed the reforms by the Takeover Panel.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Government also has a wider role to play here - particularly in strategically important sectors. This is recognised by the current legal framework, and we are not proposing to change it. It is important that companies focus on creating sustainable competitive advantage, not on complex merger and acquisition strategies that destroy shareholder value.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takeovers are part of a wider context: the need to ensure that the bedrock of the capitalist system - the competitive market - functions as effectively as possible. The government is consequently strengthening the regulatory framework to create a single, powerful competition authority - the Competition and Markets Authority.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will have a duty to promote competition for the benefit of consumers and will observe the principle of supporting long-term growth. This objective will be formally embedded in its performance framework.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also ensure that the Competition and Markets Authority works closely with sector regulators to more vigorously tackle competition issues in regulated sectors.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the areas I’ve discussed depend on effective engagement between companies and their owners for progress to be made. So to fuel to the cultural change that’s required, we are endorsing John Kay’s ‘Principles for Equity Markets’ - and the directions for market practice which flow from these.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular we have challenged leading industry bodies - including the NAPF - to review the report’s Good Practice Statements. I am delighted the NAPF has accepted this challenge.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to measure the headway we are making on John Kay’s recommendations we will publish a progress check in eighteen months’ time, setting out how Government has taken forward the recommendations and how well companies and investors have stepped up to the plate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrial Strategy and **&lt;/strong&gt;Financial Services  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**There are other major policies afoot which have at their heart an attempt to inject a more long term approach to business decision making. One is the industrial strategy in which we sit down with sectors like aerospace, life sciences, automobiles, energy supply chains, and others to plan the long term implications for skill development, technological change and innovation and procurement.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another is financial services. Tim Breedon’s recent review for me found the UK has one of the most sophisticated financial centres in the world. But UK businesses outside the financial sector aren’t getting the benefit from this. There is a kind of enclave development unconnected with the real economy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One specific example is that while the City can provide a range of sophisticated services to international business, British medium and small companies cannot get long-term, patient capital for love nor money.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we need to fundamentally change the system so the financial services industry serves businesses, and not the contrary.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are taking a number of steps to reform the banking industry, but we need to go further and reshape the business finance market. That is why I have announced the creation of a business bank that will have as its core mission to stimulate competition in the business finance markets and make them work for businesses.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a clean balance sheet, and £1bn worth of funding, this bank will be tasked with expanding lending and investment to the manufacturers, exporters and high growth companies that power our economy, in particular addressing the need for long-term, patient capital.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will shortly announce the appointment of an advisory group for the bank. Its task will be to help shape the design and its future activities  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Wider work   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**There are many other areas that will help promote long termism, and truly responsible capitalism, such as greater diversity in workforces - especially in the boardroom, the growth of social enterprise and alternative models such as employee ownership and mutuals. I cannot hope to go into detail on all of these areas in this speech, but we are making good progress  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Conclusion  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**This then, is the government’s clear priority - ensuring we have a market economy rooted in a system of responsible capitalism. Expectations of the market system have changed since the financial crisis - after paying for its reconstruction, UK citizens must see and share in the benefits of recovery and growth.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The far-reaching reforms I have discussed today will help, but they are the start of a much longer process. One that requires a change in attitude and behaviour among key players in the system.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies are beginning to recognise this, and are investing in jobs, skills, supply chain development, and other areas that will help create long-term value.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only by responding to these concerns that we can restore trust in markets - and as major shareholders you are in a uniquely strong position to help achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2012/11/21 - Delivering Value for Money and Innovation in Defence</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech delivered by Secretary of State for Defence at the Reform Defence Conference, KPMG, Canada Square, London on Wednesday 21 November 2012.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Armed Forces exist to protect our country and provide the ultimate guarantee of its security and independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be the first duty of Government, and everything we do in Defence is directed at supporting that objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generating the military capability required to meet the needs of national security;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And delivering that capability on operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most fiendishly complex tasks of Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of the most expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With resources as tight as they are, the obligation to deliver value for money is paramount:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making sure every pound of taxpayers’ money spent on Defence has a tangible impact on delivering capability to the front-line and on the security of the nation;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, enhancing the efficiency of Defence delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today I want talk about how, over the last two and a half years, we have set about reforming the way Defence is managed to deliver that improved efficiency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restructuring the MOD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-configuring our Armed Forces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Balancing the budget&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting the equipment programme on a sustainable course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because none of this would be possible without the people who make up Defence, I want to say a bit about how we will modernise the offer that we make to the men and women of our Armed Forces, so that their terms and conditions, while they will never look like those associated with civilian employment, better reflect lifestyles in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to start by re-capping the scale of the reform challenge we face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transformation"&gt;Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review kick-started one of the biggest change programmes taking place anywhere in the Western world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A change programme essential to ensuring that our Armed Forces can continue to defend our country, protect our interests and project our values abroad;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of a complex range of threats in a rapidly changing environment; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building the powerful, adaptable and, crucially, sustainable Armed Forces we require;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipped with some of the best and most advanced technology in the world;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all at a cost that the country can afford and on a scale that we can sustain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this change programme isn’t just about meeting the Future Force 2020 structure set out in the SDSR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also about changing the way we deliver Defence to make sure we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overheated equipment programme this Government inherited was a symptom of a much deeper malaise that was fundamentally about the way in which the Department operated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Levene’s Defence Reform Review set out clearly what the problems were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A focus on short-term affordability at the expense of long-term value for money and a lack of financial rigour throughout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Head Office, which was trying to micro-manage from the centre, disempowering the people who actually deliver in the Service Commands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confusion over who was accountable for what&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Few levers for those who wanted to innovate and change behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An over-complicated and fragmented structure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And an unbalanced relationship between the Department and its suppliers - with poorly aligned incentives driving sometimes perverse behaviours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting these problems resolved is every bit as important as eliminating the inherited black hole in the budget if we are to deliver sustainable, long-term change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without fundamental reform in the way the budget is managed, the way decisions are taken, and how Defence is run, the same problems will re-materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are getting on with implementing Lord Levene’s recommendations which we accepted in full:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the behaviours so that we do not repeat the same mistakes again;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focussing on long-term value, not short-term cash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering value for money by making sure we have modern, innovative ways of doing business;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where people accept responsibility for decisions and have the power to make them;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing us to weed out duplication, red-tape, perverse incentives, waste and delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken as a whole, this is a 10 year reform plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, halfway through this Parliament, and half way between two SDSRs; a year and a half on from the Defence Reform Review; it is worth reflecting how far we have come already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came into the Department, many of the tough decisions on force structure had already been taken: to shrink the size of the MOD; to rationalize our equipment programme; and to reduce the size of the Navy, Army and the Air Force, while increasing investment in the Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They just needed implementing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the senior management was beginning the process of changing the way Defence was managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make no apologies for the fact that I chose to focus on the money first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no option of continuing the ‘finger in the dam’ approach to Defence budgeting, which had resulted in the MOD lurching over a decade from budget crisis to budget crisis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salami-slicing each year in the hope that “something would turn up” to fund the programme in the next;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing projects further and further to the right in an unsustainable and ever-expanding bubble;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budgeting based on fantasy rather than reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ill-served the tax-payer, who ended up paying more for less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ill-served the Defence Industry, who found it impossible to invest with any certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it ill-served our Armed Forces, who could not plan with confidence politicians promised them would be delivered on time, to requirement and in the numbers expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have instituted an integrated financial and military capability planning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming prudently rather than optimistically, so that we can focus on value rather than on cash management; with a proper centrally held contingency reserve against the equipment programme, and (an innovation in MOD terms) an annual Departmental Unallocated Provision:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving from a culture of spending first and working out how to afford the long-term costs later to one of only committing to what we can be confident that we can deliver;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living within our means, rather than systematically planning beyond them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our new cost controls in place, no project can be committed without a 10-year budget line to cover not only its procurement, but also its support costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we allocate projects to the committed core programme only at the point when they need to be committed in order to be delivered on time, and only in accordance with the military assessment of priority at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending a long-established “conspiracy” between the industry and the Department to “lock in” unaffordable projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By maintaining these simple disciplines, sensibly managing in-year budgets, and forecasting prudently, we are changing the dynamic in the equipment programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we still have to live with the legacy projects - against which we have now made prudent provision of financial contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will continue to have a negative effect on the Department’s public reputation for project management as their original fantasy budgets and timelines are exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can now make choices, based on military priorities, about which new capabilities we can afford, rather than which bits of the programme we have to cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by delivering this budgetary discipline we are already demonstrating the benefits to the Armed Forces and to Industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding projects when it is safe to do so, not cutting them because we have run out of cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I announced in May that we had achieved a balanced budget, I have been able to give the go ahead to some half a billion pounds of further investment in Equipment and Support, including targeting pods for fast jets, better protection systems for Tornado GR4, enhancements to MERLIN Helicopters and new FOXHOUND vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And further announcements are imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year is, I am told by old lags in the Department, the first in living memory that the MOD has not had to sit down in September and decide which programmes need to be cut or delayed in order to remain within spending control targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major step forward for the MOD and for the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Reform&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we have started to see the benefits of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we want them to be sustained, we need to ensure that the changes we are making in how Defence is managed become engrained in its culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that budgetary discipline becomes the supporting foundation of everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sustainability is considered in every decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building-in a focus on value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing structures and incentives to change behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging innovation to improve delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locking in the significant reductions in running costs we are achieving by making the organisation more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already on course to save approximately £2bn in non-frontline costs in the year 2014/15, compared to 2010/11 baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of this saving will be sustainable reductions, so we can expect to maintain high-levels of savings in following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a ten year period we expect to save around £15bn of non front line costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how"&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we are pushing authority and accountability down the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving Top Level Budget holders the freedoms and incentives they need to drive efficiencies and improve delivery in their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head Office is becoming smaller, on course to shrink by 25% by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly constituted Defence Board, which I chair, has been meeting regularly over the last year, providing strategic direction to the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delegated operating arrangements for Service Commands will go live in April 2013, including for the new Joint Forces Command which was stood up in April of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each Service is doing detailed work on its own operating model, identifying which activities are to be modified or stopped, and where to prioritise resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the bottom line is that they will have much greater control over planning for future capability requirement;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding where to concentrate resources to provide maximum effect;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking responsibility for living within the means provided, but with the freedom to innovate and establish better ways of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we are doing is bringing in private sector skills where we judge it necessary to help change behaviours and drive efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Business Services has been set up in a partnership with SERCO, who are providing the external management team to transform the organisation into a lean and effective shared services centre, building on best practice outside the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence Infrastructure Organisation brings together all aspects of Defence infrastructure asset management and facilities management under one organisation for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now in the process of recruiting a strategic partner to help transform its business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And perhaps most significantly, the work to overhaul procurement, the Materiel Strategy, is developing fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criticisms of the acquisition process in the Defence Reform Review were anticipated by Bernard Gray’s report for the previous Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, Defence has lacked the right business skills and capabilities to manage what are some of the largest capital and infrastructure projects being undertaken in today the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the MOD has, too often, been a poor customer for industry - and in some cases, a soft touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are setting out to create a proper interface between the Defence Equipment &amp;amp; Support organisation and the Defence customers it serves enabling it in turn to be a more effective customer for its suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will require the recruitment of a private sector partner to deliver the high-level commercial and management skills that we currently lack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently testing the value for money case for a Government Owned, Contractor Operated - or GOCO - entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final decision on the precise structure will be made in due course, but the bottom line is that the reformed DE&amp;amp;S, supported by a strategic partner, will be better by design at negotiating and managing contracts for the benefit of the tax-payer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the private sector partner injecting key disciplines, processes, skills and management freedoms into MOD’s procurement activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By refocusing the Head Office to providing strategic direction rather than micro-management, by empowering the Service Commands and other parts of Defence to deliver and to innovate, and by bringing in private sector partners with the skills and flexibilities to help them, this programme will deliver behaviour change from the bottom up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="people"&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a massive change agenda: In the Armed Forces, in the MOD and across the support organisations like DE&amp;amp;S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And change is often uncomfortable for the people at the heart of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me say unambiguously that our people in Defence are our biggest asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The men and women of our Armed Forces - Regular and Reserves; the civilians who support them; and the people who work in the industries which supply them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to rebuild the trust of all of them after a period of sometimes traumatic change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to say something this morning specifically about how we will address the challenges of recruiting and retaining for the Armed Forces once the lure of deployment on operations is gone as we withdraw from our combat role in Afghanistan by the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, hopefully, against the challenge of a healthier civilian economy as a competitor for talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="service-personnel"&gt;Service Personnel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my big learning curves over the last year has been understanding the unique nature of what the military call the “moral component” of Defence; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it is that provides the “will to fight”, and the determination to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it is that allows us to recruit some of the best people the country can provide to preserve the unique attributes of our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives us our edge over other countries, many of whom have larger Armed Forces and similar equipment to us, but very, very few of which can come close to matching our military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our people that give Britain’s Armed Forces their special quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know that some of them feel, perhaps many of them feel, they have taken a bit of a pounding over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redundancies; downsizing; re-structuring; relocation; re-roling for the post Afghanistan world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all while fighting a long and difficult counter-insurgency and stabilization campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must often have felt like the perfect storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future Armed Forces will continue to offer careers that are exciting, challenging and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we want to continue to recruit and retain the best people, both Regulars and Reservists, that may not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to ensure that we can compete to attract them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it has been 40 years since the current package of terms and conditions was last fully updated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime it has been adapted and modified on an ad-hoc basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that now, it is costly, complex, impenetrable and inflexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, it fails to meet the requirements of today’s Service Personnel, or to reflect the needs of modern family life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need to modernise the offer we make to our people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-employment-model"&gt;New Employment Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in doing so, we need to achieve three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to secure for Defence the people it needs - both in terms of quality and quantity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruiting to preserve the unique attributes of the Armed Forces by drawing adventurous, spirited and committed people to the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we need to reflect the changes in social, demographic and economic conditions in our society and the complexities of modern family life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no identikit soldier, sailor or airman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each one is an individual, with different needs at different points in their careers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no identikit Service career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a young recruit wants from the package may be very different from an NCO in his late 20s with a wife and small children - and we have to make sure that what we provide is an attractive offer for both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the package needs to be affordable and sustainable in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attractive to Service personnel and fair to the tax-payer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me be clear: this is not a cost cutting exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look at the structure of pay and allowances it will be to make it more flexible and more responsive to individual needs as well as to better reflect the priorities of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But within an envelope that is broadly cost-neutral overall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed to deliver better value to the individual at the same broad cost to the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call this project “the New Employment Model”, or NEM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it isn’t a single project at all but a number of distinct workstrands addressing different challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not about overnight transformation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a process out to 2020 and beyond:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed to meet the expectations of a generation that has yet to join the Service, as well as our current Servicemen and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some elements are capable of being delivered relatively early while others will take longer to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the NEM will be a measured shift in the nature of the offer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards a greater emphasis on individual value, personal choice and responsibility;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring greater value to the individual through more flexible tailoring of the complex package that makes up Armed Forces remuneration;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more stability to service families through fewer moves, more opportunities for employment of the partners and greater opportunities for home ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="housing--spousal-employment"&gt;Housing &amp;amp; Spousal Employment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accommodation lies at the heart of this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of our Regular Service personnel rely on publically provided accommodation because the job currently demands a very high degree of mobility around the UK - and sometimes beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 22 year career, as currently structured, a typical Service person could expect to be asked to move 10 or more times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want this to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we bring the British Army back from Germany we want to offer more stability and in doing so make it possible for families to set down roots as civilian families do. Greatly reducing the need for family moves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabling the children of Service personnel to be settled in one area and to avoid frequent changes of school;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And making it easier for partners of Service personnel to find work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything we do must of course be done in a way which continues to support operational capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our goal is to enable Service Personnel more freedom to make the choices that other people make:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About where to live;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And about whether to rent or buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, home ownership rates among current and former members of the Armed Forces are comparatively low, suggesting an element of systematic disadvantage - something which the Armed Forces Covenant commits us to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, alongside a steady improvement in the quality of service accommodation, we want to increase access to home ownership for Service personnel, providing realistic lifestyle choices to our people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways this could be achieved and we will look at developing a range of options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stark fact is that people in the Armed Forces, with a generous, non-contributory pension scheme, are accumulating significant wealth during their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a significant part of their total remuneration package cost that wealth creation but without them being able to access it to facilitate house purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that disadvantages them compared to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the challenge we have set ourselves is to explore models that would allow our people either to directly access some of that accumulating wealth or to use it to collateralise mortgage borrowing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting forces home ownership;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And removing an important element of disadvantage service people face relative to their civilian counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would not, of course, remove the need for Service accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially for younger, single service people, this will often be the right choice, or indeed, the only one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces will continue to provide subsidised accommodation for those who require it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, whether you are in the Forces or in a civilian job, taking on the responsibility of homeownership these days often requires two reliable incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So making it easier for the partners of service people to find and keep work is a critical precondition to boosting home ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making military basing more settled will be a big step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also recognise that some bases, by necessity, are in relatively remote locations with limited employment opportunities for partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the areas I want to explore urgently in 2013 is how we could use parts of the military estate to stimulate local economic growth and employment generation around garrisons - by providing incentives for business relocation to land that we hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus creating conveniently located job opportunities for the Armed Forces community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a whole, the New Employment Model will include everything from the accommodation and home ownership issues which I have discussed today, to overall pay structure, training and education needs, career management and manpower control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NEM will support both Regular and Reserve personnel - and will build on the Whole Force concept and the integration of Regular and Reserves which I set out earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, we will begin consulting with Service personnel, and testing some of the ideas we are developing on the people they are designed to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have set out this morning, the progress we have made on one of the most ambitious transformation programmes ever undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A programme necessary to ensure that our Armed Forces are affordable and sustainable, as well as flexible and effective in the face of both fiscal challenges and strategic uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should not undervalue what we have already achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we should not underestimate the scale of what is still to be done.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have defined the new structure of our forces and the shape of the MOD that will support them;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have developed our plan to bring the army home from Germany;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And an Equipment Programme which can be delivered and afforded;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms to maintain budget discipline are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is, relatively speaking, the easy bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real, long-term challenge is to change behaviours, align incentives and shift the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that the resource discipline that we have imposed feeds through into sustainable, bottom-up efficiency gain, not reduction in output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the challenge is now to improve the productivity of every part of the Defence organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejecting the notion that a given percentage cut in the Defence budget must inevitably mean a similar percentage cut in our military capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that requires a motivated and engaged workforce;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One that recognises the challenges we are facing;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares our vision for the future of Defence;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understands the plan for delivering it;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And feels a valued part of that plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era of redundancy and pay restraint, that is a big challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is the one we must now address;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through greater empowerment, both personal and professional;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And through better delivery of value to the individual from the remuneration package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the key task for 2013 for the leadership of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of us is in any doubt about the scale of that task;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But neither do we doubt its centrality to everything we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>The position of an independent Scotland in relation to the EU was examined in a speech today by Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire. Hugo Swire said Scotland “would have to apply to join the EU as a new state”</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May I firstly congratulate the Honourable Member for Glasgow North for securing this debate today and the Honourable Members from both sides of the House for their contributions to it and for the insight it has provided on this critical issue.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need not remind Honourable Members that the United Kingdom’s membership of the European Union touches the lives of all our citizens.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of our trade is with the EU - total exports to the EU in 2011 were £234 billion. The single market underpins a large portion of our economy, allowing our businesses to trade freely across a market of some half a billion people.  It facilitates collective action on issues that are too big for any one nation to tackle on its own. It magnifies our voice in the world on pressing international questions, such as the current situation in the Middle East or our concerns over Iran’s nuclear ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the United Kingdom, of course, that is the Member State: it is named in the European Union’s fundamental treaties as such. And it is the Government of the United Kingdom that must therefore negotiate in the EU’s various formations in the best interests of all its citizens.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means we take into account the interests of the devolved administrations when formulating the UK’s position in EU negotiations which touch on the areas of policy that fall to the Scottish and Welsh Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits of devolution in EU negotiations  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good for people and businesses in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as well as England. It means that they all have a strong voice in the formulation of policy that matters to them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the voting weight and the capability and credibility of the UK’s negotiations in the EU are mobilised in the service of all UK citizens. But that does not mean the devolved administrations are only involved in EU policy when we are coming up with an agreed negotiating position for the UK. This Government has been open to having Ministers from the Devolved Administrations in the room, where appropriate, during the negotiations themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current devolution arrangements allow the special circumstances of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to be championed by one of the largest and most influential Member States. Scottish independence, with a complex accession negotiation and no guarantee of favourable terms of membership at the end of it, would inevitably put a stop to that. Those advocating splitting off from the UK need to be clear about what that means in practice and use evidence to set out their position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independence and EU accession  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have heard this morning, some advocate a fundamental reworking of the existing constitutional settlement that so benefits the people of the UK.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who argue for an independent Scotland suggest that only independence will give their nation a voice in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their argument is underpinned by the assertion - and it is only an assertion - that an independent Scotland would simply continue in membership of the EU, automatically inheriting the same arrangements that pertain to the UK now. We learnt only a few weeks ago, as we have also heard this morning - as the SNP was forced to reveal following a Freedom of Information request - that it had not previously commissioned any legal advice on an independent Scotland’s place in the EU. Yet the SNP has been making these assertions for several years while in Government. Many will find it absolutely astonishing that while seeking to make their case for splitting Scotland from the UK the SNP have been basing their facts on unfounded assertions rather than cold facts.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not need to remind honourable members that the UK has managed to negotiate, over the years, exemptions from membership of the euro and from the Schengen common visa area, ensuring that the UK can maintain control over its own monetary and border policies.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition honourable members will be only too aware of the importance of the UK’s rebate, negotiated with great skill and determination over twenty-five years ago. The rebate continues to ensure that the UK taxpayer is relieved of some of the burden of supporting some of the most imbalanced parts of the EU budget, which at the moment is of great concern to us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the UK has a permanent opt out from the euro, from the Schengen border free zone, a permanent rebate on our net contributions to the EU budget, a choice whether to join new EU laws in justice and home affairs and a protocol on how the Charter of Fundamental Rights applies to the UK.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if Scotland left the UK and applied to join the EU all of these would be subject to negotiation, and there is no guarantee whatsoever that Scotland would obtain any of these special rights that the UK currently enjoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is precisely the UK’s weight and influence, as one of the largest Member States that has helped us to succeed in negotiating such arrangements. And Scotland, like England, Northern Ireland and Wales, derives enormous advantage from them.  So I can see why the SNP is so keen to suggest to those voting in the referendum before the end of 2014 that they would simply continue in the event of independence, as if nothing had changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the fact is that if Scotland became independent, everything would change. Independence is not simply an extension of the devolution arrangements that have worked so well. It is not merely a further point on the constitutional continuum. It is a fundamental change - a definitive split from the rest of the UK, an irreversible step. Independence would bring devolution to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As set out in the FCO’s Memorandum to the Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry into a separate Scotland, independence would create a new state - one that would have to take its place on an already crowded international stage. England, Northern Ireland and Wales would continue the international legal personality of the UK; Scotland, having decided to leave the UK, would start afresh. The overwhelming weight of international legal precedent underscores this point. There are many examples of this: one is India and Pakistan - where following independence India continued the UN membership and Pakistan joined as a new state. Another is the USSR where Russia continued the legal personality of the USSR and the other Former Soviet Union states were treated as new states. There is Ethiopia and Eritrea; and there is Sudan and South Sudan.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That new state would need to decide which international organisations it wanted to belong to, in the context of its overall foreign policy. Obviously, it could not simply assert its membership of any of those organisations. The most likely scenario by far is that an independent Scotland would have to apply to join the EU as a new state, involving negotiation with the rest of the UK and other Member States, the outcome of which cannot be predicted. Scotland would no longer be represented with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Nor would a separate Scotland qualify for the G8 or the G20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Government is not alone in taking a factual and legally based approach to the issue. Jose Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission made clear that “a new state, if it wants to join the European Union, has to apply to become a member like any state.” Recent correspondence between the Spanish Government and Commissioner Reding on this issue also supported this interpretation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, an independent Scotland could not just assert that it would be a member of the club - the other members would need to agree as well. The comments of the Spanish Foreign Minister, Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, to the Spanish Parliament on the 23rd of October must be noted: “in the hypothetical case of independence, Scotland would have to join the queue and ask to be admitted, needing the unanimous approval of all Member States to obtain the status of a candidate country.” What the Spanish Foreign Minister was referring to was the list of candidate countries wanting to join the EU - Macedonia, Iceland, Serbia, Montenegro and Turkey.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the remarks of a Foreign Minister of a major EU Member State with an obvious interest in this issue. The Scottish Government must be prepared to respond and be upfront about the uncertainties surrounding their position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, an independent Scotland would not simply ‘continue’ automatically in membership of the EU. The EU Treaties would have to be amended to allow Scotland to join; and that would involve a negotiation. What terms would it secure? Would Scotland be able to avoid the commitment to join the euro or the Schengen area that every new Member State since 1992 has taken on? The simple answer is: we do not know. None of this is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the SNP, the UK Government is taking a transparent approach to analyzing the legal issues, including by engaging with eminent legal experts. On 2 October this year, the Advocate General for Scotland - one of the UK Government’s three Law Officers - delivered a speech at the Edinburgh Centre for Constitutional Law, setting out the Government’s initial view on the legal questions. The Government has also made clear that we will provide detailed evidence and analysis so that people in Scotland can make an informed decision about whether to stay in the UK and the implications in leaving it. We will publish this analysis over the course of 2013.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the clear position of the UK Government that Scotland is better off in the UK, and the UK is better off with Scotland in it. We are backing up that position with a robust programme of analysis and evidence. Those advocating independence for Scotland are making assertions that suit their argument, with no solid foundation in fact.    &lt;/p&gt;
