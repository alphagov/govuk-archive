&lt;p&gt;This is published every 6 months to give businesses an indication of when regulations affecting them will be coming into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headline figures show:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are introducing 24 measures in this period, 20 of which are deregulatory measures that will reduce the burden on business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;none of these measures will increase the regulatory burden on businesses, as they are all either deregulatory measures that will bring savings to business, or regulatory measures that have no cost to business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Regulatory Policy Committee have evaluated 5 of our measures and estimated that they will reduce the burden on business by £45.36 million per year. We expect this figure to rise considerably as our other measures are validated.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Assessment of the Business Link helpline</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) with an early understanding of whether the Business Link helpline is performing effectively against its strategic objective of ‘digital transformation’, in which more businesses are assisted online rather than through other higher cost provision (for example face-to-face contact). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the research has assessed the value of the service being provided to callers and how far actual demand has matched expectations. The findings are being used to help inform plans for continual improvement of the service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review is based on interviews with helpline staff, analysis of monitoring data, call case studies and a customer survey that consisted of 657 telephone interviews that were completed with customers of the helpline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;This particular OGEL permits, subject to certain conditions, the export or transfer of items specified in Schedule 1 of the licence to those companies referred to in Schedule 2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always consult this list first before registering to use the licence via &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk"&gt;SPIRE&lt;/a&gt;, ECO’s export licensing database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also be aware that the Euopean Commission also publishes a publically available database called &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/defence/certider/"&gt;CERTIDER&lt;/a&gt;. This Euopean database contains more information about the certification of defence-related companies across Europe.

    <title>Assessment of the online business support offer: Growth and Improvement Service, My New Business</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) with an early understanding of whether online business support services provided by Business Link have performed effectively against the strategic objective of ‘digital transformation’.  That is to successfully assist businesses through a website rather than through higher cost services (for example face to face contact). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also makes an early assessment of the value of the services provided to new users, with a focus on cost effectiveness and effective referral to other appropriate business support services in the public, private and third sectors. The support services include the comprehensive start-up service provided by My New Business, and online tools provided by the Growth Improvement Service, enabling businesses to identify and solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Call for evidence on the government's review of the balance of competences between the United Kingdom and the European Union</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/images/logos/balance-of-competencies.JPG?w=200&amp;amp;h=50&amp;amp;as=1" alt="Review of the Balance of Competences"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government is carrying out a review of the balance of competences between the EU and the UK. This is an audit of what the EU does and how it affects the UK. You can read more about it on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/european-union/balance-of-competences-review/"&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s web page on the balance of competences review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have published our first &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/europe/docs/g/12-1278-government-review-balance-competences-united-kingdom-european-union-call.pdf"&gt;Call for Evidence on the Internal Market: Synoptic Review (PDF, 735 Kb) &lt;/a&gt;. The Synoptic report will cover the overall application and effect of the EU Internal Market. The result of the report will be a comprehensive , thorough and detailed analysis of the wider functioning of the Internal Market. It will determine how the so-called “Four Freedoms” operate together to create an efficient and operating Internal Market and ultimately what this means for the UK. We will subsequently be reviewing each of the “Four Freedoms” in turn in semesters 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone wishing to contribute to the review is asked to send their written views before 28 February 2013 to &lt;a href="mailto:balanceofcompetences@bis.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;balanceofcompetences@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; or online at &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/internalmarket"&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/internalmarket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our intention to publish evidence at the end of the review when the reports are published. In the meantime, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills plans to use section 22 to exempt FOI requests around evidence received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
