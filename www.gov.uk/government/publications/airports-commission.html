<p>On 7 September 2012, the government announced its intention to create an independent commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, to identify and recommend to government options for maintaining the UK’s status as a global aviation hub.</p>

<p>The commission’s role will be to identify and evaluate how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and long term whilst maintaining a UK-wide perspective. The commission will need to ensure it undertakes a thorough assessment of all the issues by considering all relevant factors including the economic, environmental and social costs and benefits and where necessary, the operational and technical deliverability.</p>

<p>The commission’s website is currently under development. More information will be provided in due course.</p>
