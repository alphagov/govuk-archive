<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Driver licences were first introduced in Britain by the Motor Car Act, 1903, purely as a means of identifying vehicles and their drivers. </p>

<p>All motor vehicles had to be registered, display registration marks and be licensed annually at a cost of 20 shillings (£1).</p>

<p>The fee for the first driving licence, which was obtained over the counter at Post Offices, was 5 shillings (25p).</p>

<p>Failure to sign your driving licence with your ‘ordinary signature’ could lead to a fine of up to £5.</p>

<p>In 1921 there were only 1 million drivers in Britain. By 1939 this figure had risen to 3 million. But it was only during the 1960s, when cars became more affordable, that motoring really took off.</p>

<p>In 1973 the number of drivers had risen to about 20 million and a centralised computer-based licensing system was brought in to cope with the huge increase in demand for both driver and vehicle licences.</p>

<h2 id="the-highway-code">The Highway Code</h2>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of copies of The Highway Code are sold each year, ensuring that it never leaves the bestseller lists. It’s one of the few books in print that can lay claim to saving thousands of lives. </p>

<p>When it was first launched in 1931 there were just 2.3 million motor vehicles in Great Britain, yet over 7,000 people were killed in road accidents each year.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="The Highway Code first edition" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1084/highway-code-first-edition.jpg"></div>
  <figcaption>The Highway Code first edition</figcaption></figure><p>Today there are more than 27 million vehicles on our roads but, thanks to greater public awareness, advances in technology and the introduction of British summer time, only half the number of road deaths occur.</p>

<p>Some things have not changed over the years: the very first edition of The Highway Code urged all road users to be careful and considerate towards others, putting safety first. However, other aspects of the code have changed considerably. For example, in 1931 mirrors were not even mentioned and drivers were advised to sound their horn when overtaking.</p>

<p>Nowadays, advice on how to cross the road fills a whole chapter, but in the early days it only merited a paragraph. More than a third of the original 24-page booklet described the various hand signals the police and road users should use, compared to the single page given to the subject in the current edition.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-edition">The first edition</h3>
<p>The first edition was published in 1931, it:</p>

<ul>
<li>cost 1 old penny</li>
  <li>was the only one to carry advertisements, for the AA, The Autocar magazine, The Motorcycle magazine, Castrol Motor Oil, BP, Motor Union Insurance and the RAC</li>
  <li>contained 18 pages of advice, compared to 135 pages in the 2007 edition</li>
  <li>included advice to drivers of horse drawn vehicles to ‘rotate the whip above the head; then incline the whip to the right or left to show the direction in which the turn is to be made.’</li>
</ul>
<p>Since those early days, regular revisions of the Code have reflected changes in technology and developments in traffic management and road safety.</p>

<h3 id="road-signs">Road signs</h3>
<p>Diagrams of road signs - just 10 signs in all - were first seen in the second edition, as was a warning about the dangers of driving when affected by alcohol or fatigue.</p>

<h3 id="stopping-distances">Stopping distances</h3>
<p>Stopping distances made their first appearance in the third edition, along with new sections giving hints on driving and cycling.</p>

<h3 id="in-colour">In colour</h3>
<p>The 1954 Highway Code, complemented by brand new colour illustrations, gave over the back cover to first aid guidance, while the expanded traffic signs section contained the first triangular warning signs.</p>

<h3 id="motorways">Motorways</h3>
<p>The arrival of motorways in the late 1950s led to the inclusion, in the fifth edition, of a new section on motorway driving. It explained such things as how to use exit slip roads and advising drivers to avoid drowsiness by stretching their legs at the parking or service areas.</p>

<h3 id="photographs-and-3d-illustrations">Photographs and 3D illustrations</h3>
<p>By the sixth edition in 1968 photographs and 3D illustrations had been included to help make rules clear and the price had risen from 6 old pence to 1/3d (6p). After decimalisation reprinted editions cost just 6 new pence.</p>

<h3 id="green-cross-code">Green Cross Code</h3>
<p>The 70-page 1978 edition introduced the Green Cross Code for pedestrians and the new orange badges for people with a disability. Prompted by soaring car crime statistics, the amended version contained advice on vehicle security.</p>

<h3 id="theory-test">Theory test</h3>
<p>The 1990s saw a new format taller booklet and the inclusion of a section geared to the new driving theory test, which in the current edition has now become part of the Code itself.</p>

<h3 id="getting-social">Getting social</h3>
<p>In 2011 the Highway Code joined social networking websites Twitter and Facebook to share reminders of the rules of the road.</p>

<h3 id="the-highway-code-app">The Highway Code app</h3>
<p>In May 2012 <a rel="external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/official-highway-code/id522687241?mt=8" title="The Official Highway Code app">The Official Highway Code app</a> for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad was launched, priced £3.99.</p>

<h2 id="development-and-timeline-of-british-driving-road-safety-and-driving-tests">Development and timeline of British driving, road safety and driving tests</h2>

<h2 id="section">1888</h2>
<p>The first recorded sale of a manufactured motor car was to Emile Roger of Paris, who bought a petrol-driven Benz.</p>

<h2 id="section-1">1907</h2>
<p>Cabs with meters began operating in London.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">1930</h2>
<p>Regulations introduced covering endorsements and fitness declaration. The Road Traffic Act 1930 introduces licensing system for public service vehicles (<abbr title="Public service vehicle">PSV</abbr>). In the early days of motoring, one licence covered both cars and motorcycles use. Age restrictions and a form of driving tests brought in for disabled drivers. Full licences for disabled drivers valid for 1 year.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">1931</h2>
<p><abbr title="Public service vehicle">PSV</abbr> drivers could be required to take a test, at discretion of Traffic Commissioners.
The first edition of the Highway Code was published including advice for motorcycle riders.</p>

<h2 id="february">1934 (16 February)</h2>
<p>Licences for lorry drivers were introduced under the Road Traffic Act, 1934 - the licensing authority could require the applicant to submit to a practical test of their ability.
‘Belisha’ beacons provide advanced warning of new pedestrian crossings.</p>

<h2 id="march">1935 (16 March)</h2>
<p>Voluntary testing was introduced by the Road Traffic Act, 1934, to avoid a rush of candidates when the test becomes compulsory. Mr J Beene was the first person to pass his driving test, at a cost of 7/ 6d (37.5p)</p>

<h2 id="june">1935 (1 June)</h2>
<p>Compulsory testing was brought in for all drivers and riders who started driving on or after 1 April 1934:</p>

<ul>
<li>around 246,000 candidates applied</li>
  <li>the pass rate was 63%</li>
  <li>between 9 and 16 half-hour tests were conducted each day by 250 examiners</li>
</ul>
<p>Those passing the motorcycling test did not need to take another test to drive a car. The test was conducted by the examiner positioning themselves at a point where they could observe the motorcyclist’s riding such as beside a common or in a city square.</p>

<p>In the case of sidecar outfits or three-wheelers, the examiner might have accompanied the rider.</p>

<p>Examiners were responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>handling the booking of driving tests</li>
  <li>they met candidates at pre-arranged locations such as car parks or railway stations because there were no test centres</li>
</ul>
<p>Other road safety milestones included:</p>

<ul>
<li>anyone buying a driving licence must put ‘L’ plates on the car and eventually take a driving test to get their full licence</li>
  <li>a 30 miles per hour (mph) speed limit was introduced in urban areas</li>
  <li>windscreen wipers were used for the first time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="january">1937 (1 January)</h2>
<p>Speedometers and safety glass in windscreens were made compulsory.
Provisional licences were brought in for heavy goods vehicle (<abbr title="Heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr>) drivers.</p>

<h2 id="september">1939 (2 September)</h2>
<p>Driving tests were suspended for the duration of World War 2. During the war, examiners  were redeployed to traffic duties and supervision of fuel rationing.</p>

<h2 id="january-1">1940 (1 January)</h2>
<p><abbr title="Heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> licences and tests were suspended during World War 2.</p>

<h2 id="november">1946 (1 November)</h2>
<p>Testing resumed after World War 2.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">1947</h2>
<p>The Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations placed motorcyclists in their own licence group, but testing remained virtually unchanged until the 1960s.</p>

<h2 id="february-1">1947 (18 February)</h2>
<p>A period of 1 year was granted for wartime provisional licences to be converted into full licence without passing the test.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">1950</h2>

<p>Testing was suspended during the Suez Crisis. Learners were allowed to drive unaccompanied and examiners helped to administer petrol rations. </p>

<h2 id="april">1957 (15 April)</h2>
<p>Testing resumed after Suez Crisis.</p>

<h2 id="july">1957 (15 July)</h2>
<p>Provisional licences were no longer stamped with ‘passed test’.</p>

<h2 id="september-1">1957 (1 September)</h2>
<p>The three-year driving licence was introduced under the Road Traffic Act 1956. The fee for a replacement licence, if lost or defaced, rises by 150% from 1 shilling (5p) to 2/ 6d (12.5p).</p>

<h2 id="march-1">1958 (1 March)</h2>
<p>Provisional licences are valid for 6 months.</p>

<h2 id="december">1958 (December)</h2>
<p>The M6 Preston bypass was the first stretch of motorway built.</p>

<h2 id="section-7">1959</h2>
<p>A new examiner training facility was acquired at Stanmore training school, near Heathrow. Until then, examiners were trained ‘on the job’.</p>

<h2 id="november-2">1959 (2 November)</h2>
<p>The M1 was officially opened, in the early days it had none of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>speed limit</li>
  <li>central reservation</li>
  <li>crash barriers</li>
  <li>motorway lighting</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="july-1">1961 (1 July)</h2>
<p>Learner riders were restricted to machines of no more than 250cc capacity in order to deal with the high number of motorcycling fatalities.</p>

<h2 id="april-1">1962 (1 April)</h2>

<h2 id="section-8">1963</h2>
<p>The Road Traffic Act 1962 permitted riders to ride motorcycles of more than 250cc after passing their test. New grouping systems were introduced for driving tests and driving licences and a distinction was made between the test of competence and the test of fitness.  Mopeds were placed in their own vehicle group for driving test purposes.</p>

<h2 id="section-9">1964</h2>
<p>A voluntary register of approved driving instructors (ADIs) was set up under the Road Traffic Act 1962. To become an <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> you had to pass stringent written and practical tests. </p>

<h2 id="section-10">1965</h2>
<p>Centralised licensing system was set up at new Swansea Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre (<abbr title="Driver and vehicle licensing centre">DVLC</abbr>), taking over licence issue from County/Borough councils.</p>

<h2 id="may">1965 (1 May)</h2>
