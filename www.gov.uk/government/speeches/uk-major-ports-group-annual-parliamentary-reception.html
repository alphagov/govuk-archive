<h2 id="opening-remarks">Opening remarks</h2>

<p>Thank you for that introduction Charles (Charles Hammond – Chairman UK Major Ports Group/UKMPG).</p>

<p>And thank you also for asking me along - I’m delighted to have this chance to meet with you this evening.</p>

<h2 id="facts-are-stubborn-things">Facts are stubborn things</h2>

<p>John Adams, second President of the United States, said, “Facts are stubborn things”.</p>

<p>And for me, the stubborn facts prove that Britain’s ports are a national asset:</p>

<ul>
<li>every year more than 500 million tonnes of freight and well over 20 million international passengers pass through our ports</li>
  <li>they account for over 95% of our imports and exports by volume</li>
  <li>and they employ around 130,000 people and contribute close to £7 billion to <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> (Oxford Economics Report 2011)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-ports-matter-more-than-ever">Our ports matter more than ever</h2>

<p>Put simply, our ports matter.</p>

<p>And with Britain facing the most serious economic challenge in a generation, they matter more than ever.</p>

<p>Yes, you create wealth, jobs and growth right here at home.</p>

<p>And that contribution is absolutely vital to the health of our national economy.</p>

<p>But your economic importance doesn’t start and finish at our borders.</p>

<p>And that’s because you connect our country and our companies to new markets and new customers overseas.</p>

<p>Nobody has more experience, or more expertise, in accessing the global economy - seizing its opportunities, maximising its potential.</p>

<p>Working day and night so that Britain is always open for business.</p>

<p>Making sure we’re a top trading nation, as well as a leading maritime nation.</p>

<p>That’s who you are. It’s what you do - better than anyone.</p>

<p>And it’s why you are key players. The people and the firms who can help Britain out-compete and out-produce the rest of the world.</p>

<h2 id="an-evangelist-for-the-ports-industry">An evangelist for the ports industry</h2>

<p>I know I have a tough act to follow in my predecessor Mike Penning.</p>

<p>I’m sure this audience will agree that Mike was a vocal and effective champion for this country’s ports.</p>

<p>Well I want you to know that I’m determined to pick up where Mike left off by being an evangelist for your industry. </p>

<p>So be in no doubt:</p>

<ul>
<li>trust port or private company</li>
  <li>small, medium or large enterprise</li>
  <li>north, south, east or west</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be on your side.</p>

<p>The name on the ministerial door may be different.</p>

<p>But our strategy and our policy for the maritime sector remains exactly the same.</p>

<h2 id="the-right-environment-to-grow-and-succeed">The right environment to grow and succeed</h2>

<p>So I’m looking forward to visiting many of the ports you represent, to see for myself how they are coping in what remains a difficult trading climate.</p>

<p>I know these are tough and testing times</p>

<p>But, as always, your members have been equal to them</p>

<p>For me, the fact that UK ports increased their total traffic by 1.5 per cent last year is a huge achievement when set against the backdrop of continuing worldwide economic difficulties.</p>

<p>I believe that suggests your members are well placed to benefit as the economy picks up.</p>

<p>And, with interest rates at their lowest for generations, now is a good time for stable, profitable businesses to invest for the future.</p>

<p>But this government knows that we must play our part too.  And there are 2 main strands to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>creating an environment in which ports and maritime-related business of all kinds can succeed</li>
  <li>making sure that the infrastructure for which government has direct responsibility complements and supports the work you do</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why we’re supporting major container port developments like those already under construction at Felixstowe, London Gateway and Southampton.</p>

<p>This is crucial if these ports are to welcome the largest container vessels which are coming into service.  </p>

<p>These ships have the choice not to call in Britain at all if the infrastructure isn’t there.  </p>

<p>But these investments will help make sure that as many deep-sea boxes as possible are delivered directly to this country.  And that the country is ready for recovery and growth in trade in manufactured goods. </p>

<p>To which UK port will they come? That’s up to you. I’ll be as interested as anyone to see how the competition in this sector plays out. </p>

<p>And others will follow. Liverpool, Bristol, Dover and Teesport also have the necessary consents to expand their businesses.</p>

<p>But beyond the container sector, it’s imperative that every port is able to pursue a vision for the future - whether that’s responding to the opportunities brought by offshore energy, or it’s tapping into the potential of the tourism and leisure market.</p>

<p>So, regardless of the business model or maritime market your members choose, I want to make sure the government creates the right environment for them to grow and prosper.</p>

<h2 id="better-infrastructure-less-regulation">Better infrastructure, less regulation</h2>

<p>To create that environment we’re absolutely committed to investing in the strategic roads and rail infrastructure that serves UK ports.</p>

<p>This includes far-reaching improvements to the rail freight network…as part of a £9.4 billion rail investment package announced this summer.</p>

<p>Among the new initiatives is a high capacity ‘electric rail spine’ running from the south coast ports to the west Midlands and Yorkshire. </p>

<p>We are also looking at ways to relieve the congestion on road routes to and from ports</p>

<p>So, for example, we’ve set out a major scheme to boost the capacity of the A14 linking Felixstowe with the Midlands and the North,</p>

<p>This is one of the most crucial arteries for goods coming into the country and -  together with measures to boost rail freight - this modernisation will help ease the flow of traffic around one of our biggest ports.</p>

<p>We are also removing the barriers you face so you can do your job efficiently and profitably.</p>

<p>As well as being responsible for ports and shipping, I also have the title ‘Minister for Better Regulation’ within the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Well I want you to know that I also regard myself as ‘Minister for Less Regulation’.</p>

<p>So believe me, if I find suffocating red tape that’s getting in your way and slowing you down, I will cut it.</p>

<p>And where there are regulations which add no value, I will scrap them.</p>

<p>So, while we’ve already run through the Red Tape Challenge formalities, here’s a challenge that remains open to you: let me know where there is still any redundant regulation and I will try to get rid of it.</p>

<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>

<p>In conclusion, the case I’ve put this evening is that our ports have a front and centre role in the life of our nation:</p>

<ul>
<li>boosting jobs and growth in Britain</li>
  <li>acting as international gateways for trade and travel</li>
  <li>helping us transform our economic prospects</li>
</ul>
<p>But then you have always been fundamental to this country. </p>

<p>Yours is the industry that helped turn a small island nation into a major global player.</p>

<p>An industry with a proud story to tell</p>

<p>But also an industry with a great future.</p>

<p>That’s why it’s a pleasure to be here this evening.</p>

<p>And that’s why I look forward to working with you all in the months and years ahead.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
