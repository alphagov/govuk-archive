<h2 id="delivering-security-in-an-age-of-austerity">Delivering Security in an Age of Austerity</h2>

<p>Thank you Lord Hamilton for your introduction.  And it’s very good to be with you all L &amp; G once again this evening, having last spoken to the Group some years ago as Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Transformation.</p>

<h2 id="strategic-context">[Strategic Context]</h2>

<p>The National Security Strategy (the NSS), published a little over 2 years ago, reminds us that……“the first duty of Government remains: the security of our country.”</p>

<p>As many here will be aware, this is no easy task……made no easier in an age of austerity.</p>

<p>It has required us to be even more attuned to what I consider our principal challenge……the challenge of reconciling the breadth of uncertainty on the one hand……with the depth of fiscal reality on the other.</p>

<p>It’s a challenge I share with my fellow Chiefs, with whom I have had to make some difficult decisions…… and it’s a challenge shared by other nations too.</p>

<p>Like most countries, the UK assesses that the future security environment will be one in which the threats are many, varied and uncertain.</p>

<p>As Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman has observed, “the extraordinary may not necessarily be the most distant”.</p>

<p>Which is precisely why the NSS has adopted a national security posture of ‘Adaptable Britain’……so that we can respond to MacMillan’s apocryphal “Events, dear boy, events”.</p>

<p>Whilst China’s defence budget is enjoying ‘fair winds and following seas’ with annual increases typically around 11%……most western nation Defence Departments are sailing through a fiscal storm.</p>

<p>For the UK - whilst the Defence Budget at the last Comprehensive Spending Round was the 3rd smallest reduction across Government Departments – it nevertheless represented a 7.5% reduction.</p>

<p>Since 2008, the majority of smaller European countries have cut their defence budgets by around a third……and medium-sized states by 10 to 15%.  France and Germany’s have fallen by much the same as ours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the US pivots towards the Pacific, it too is cutting its military cloth by 10%……with potentially another 10% reduction depending on the outcome of sequestration.</p>

<p>And over the last decade, average defence spending across NATO’s European members has reduced from 2% of national GDP to 1.6%.</p>

<p>However, despite what some observers suggest, meeting this challenge - that of balancing threat uncertainty with economic reality – need not, in my view, mean forsaking national security to achieve fiscal stability.</p>

<h2 id="response-to-austerity">[Response to Austerity]</h2>

<p>Why do I say that?</p>

<p>Well, at the outset, I would make it clear that, from my perspective, austerity does not alter the National Security Strategy ‘Ends’……ie our level of aspiration in terms of advancing our national values and protecting our national interests worldwide.</p>

<p>Rather, what austerity does do - I would venture - is call for a change of approach.</p>

<p>It means that in delivering the NSS, Whitehall can afford only to focus on that which is a priority, a necessity, and delivers greatest value for money.</p>

<p>So, rather than altering ‘the Ends’, austerity alters ‘the Ways and the Means’.</p>

<hr>
<p>In actual fact, austerity is fuelling change on a breathtaking scale across the MoD and the RN.  Essential change that includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>wide-ranging organisational reform, to align responsibility with resource</li>
  <li>capability re-balancing for the future, to ensure Defence has the right blend of platforms and people to meet the most likely and most dangerous threats in the years to come</li>
  <li>and such change includes redirecting resources to the front line, to maintain the teeth but with a much smaller tail</li>
</ul>
<p>Austerity also means deepening and expanding the pool of collaboration……within formal NATO and EU frameworks or as part of the now-over-40-year-long membership of the Five Powers Defence Arrangement……between the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>

<p>Not to mention our close bilateral relationships with the US, France, the Netherlands and many other allies besides.</p>

<p>After all, for an outward looking country like the UK - engaged in and exposed to shared global opportunities, threats and interests - it makes sense for us to work with other nations and other navies.</p>

<p>Clearly closer collaboration includes our commitment to Coalition operations in Afghanistan……but equally important is our  commitment to the ever-growing 27-nation Combined Maritime Force in the Middle East……the world’s maritime centre of gravity, with its trade routes between the Strait of Hormuz and the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>Collaboration is why, as I speak, HMS PROTECTOR, our Ice Patrol Ship is in the South Atlantic for the Austral Summer supporting the peaceable aims of the Antarctic Treaty System.</p>

<p>It is why we host, off Scotland, the multinational, biannual exercise, Joint Warrior, the largest military exercise in Europe.  The next one, in the Spring, will involve: 10 nations; 40 fast jets; 55 warships, support ships and submarines; and 18,000 personnel.</p>

<p>At the tactical level such exercises improve interoperability, but at the strategic level they help build the all-important foundations of trust.</p>

<p>I think part of our response to austerity is also about making a more imaginative contribution to ‘Smart Power’……as we compose more enduring outcomes and effects by weaving both soft and hard power assets more elaborately into a complex counterpoint:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>where the military is part of a more nuanced first resort……to better understand the security situation so that we can improve our ability to anticipate tension……as well as to do something to contain it;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and where we also put an increased emphasis on, for example, upstream conflict prevention and capacity building.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>But above all, based on a national security posture of ‘Adaptable Britain’, such change also, importantly, requires us to adjust our approach to how, in the future, we will fight……as we move from, as the Secretary of State for Defence puts it, “Campaigns to Contingency”.</p>

<p>It’s an adjustment which places a premium upon highly capable, high-readiness forces.</p>

<h2 id="rn-response">[RN Response]</h2>

<p>Which is why under that microscope of austerity……the Royal Navy is placing a renewed emphasis upon capability and readiness……to deliver a credible contingency……a contingency which demands that navies are forward deployed with the right capability……preventing crises from emerging and possessing the ability to respond to the unforeseen.</p>

<p>ie contingent forces……not garrisoned in Naval Bases……but at sea, at readiness……and there to be used.  As indeed we are.</p>

<p>Out there right now, nearly 4500 loyal, courageous and professional sailors and marines are on operations.</p>

<p>And around 70% of our available ships and submarines are either undergoing pre-deployment training or deployed worldwide……where their presence alone sends a strong message of the UK’s ongoing commitment to those NSS ‘Ends’.</p>

<p>And with austerity acting as a catalyst for further collaboration, for embracing ‘smart power’, and for credible contingency……the broad utility of maritime forces can be used to good effect.  Let me share with you a couple of examples.</p>

<p>Take HMS DAUNTLESS’s inaugural deployment earlier this year on Atlantic Patrol Task (South) reassurance duties……where this Type 45 Destroyer provided capability ‘at readiness’ within range of our South Atlantic Islands.</p>

<p>And yet the transit to and from the region also presented a variety of opportunities to support the UK’s  emerging International Defence Engagement Strategy.  On passage:</p>

<ul>
<li>DAUNTLESS undertook national maritime security tasking in support of the Lisbon-based Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre for Narcotics……hunting drug runners if you will</li>
  <li>she participated in exercises with Atlantic-facing NATO and EU partners</li>
  <li>she conducted tasking in support of the UK’s counter-narcotics Memorandum of Understanding with Cape Verde</li>
  <li>and she contributed to maritime security capacity building in West Africa……whether assisting Gulf of Guinea states to improve the security of trade and energy extraction, or of their vital fishing stocks</li>
</ul>
<p>And consider the Response Force Task Group (the RFTG), the UK’s quick-reaction maritime force…… another example of the broad utility of maritime forces across these growth areas of further collaboration, smart power and credible contingency.</p>

<p>Conceptually, the task group consists of a mix of warships, submarines, aircraft and marines……tailored for task and able to integrate with the other Services and other nations as required.</p>

<p>Last year, under NATO’s 16-nation maritime element, the RFTG helped liberate Libya……as well as simultaneously undertake national contingent tasking east of Suez.</p>

<p>This Summer, on the Thames and off the South Coast, it supported Olympic security, arguably the largest peacetime operation in Britain since WWII.</p>

<p>And over the last 2 months the RFTG has been operating in the Mediterranean with our highly-prized amphibious forces embarked……forward deployed, providing contingency whilst developing the Combined Anglo-French Joint Expeditionary Force, as well as exercising with US and Albanian Forces……NATO’s oldest and youngest members respectively.</p>

<h2 id="the-approach">[The Approach]</h2>

<p>Ensuring that the forces we do have are used to best effect is obviously important, especially in such straitened times……but our success, in terms of “reconciling the breadth of uncertainty with the depth of fiscal reality” will I think depend on our ability to do 3 things.</p>

<p>First, our ability to manage coherency……internally, because of the numerous programmes and initiatives across a Defence-wide change agenda to deliver Future Force 2020……the size and shape of our Armed Forces around that time.</p>

<p>And externally……because as other nations’ militaries adjust their capabilities and readiness, as well as us, we all need to keep talking in order to understand the implications of others’ austerity upon our own intent…… and especially so in a more ‘dependant’ culture.</p>

<hr>
<p>We also need to be able to strike the right balance between efficiency and effectiveness……ie deliver value for money.</p>

<p>While protecting our nation’s interests worldwide……from landing marines on the Al Faw Peninsular in 2003 to evacuating civilians to safety from Lebanon in 2006……the Royal Navy has been driving efficiency right across its business.</p>

<p>Today there’s little distinction between the frontline and the non-frontline……such is the direct impact that those working in our lean HQs have on operations.</p>

<p>And where possible, we have de-latched people from platforms (on our Mine Counter Measure Vessels in the Gulf for instance)……to maximise time on task.  We keep the platforms on station for around 2 years whilst we rotate the crews every 6 months.</p>

<p>And we are working even harder to find innovative solutions, like optimising the training pipeline such that every warship and nuclear submarine is a classroom……as well as an operational platform and expression of UK sovereignty.</p>

<p>All very laudable, but we must be careful that our pursuit of efficiency is not at the expense of the very operational effectiveness that we seek to enhance.</p>

<hr>
<p>Thirdly, and arguably most importantly, we need to maintain long-term ambition.</p>

<p>Because ambition fuels change, fuels progress and, in the business of defence, fuels military advantage.</p>

<p>It demands us to lift our sights……to look even more imaginatively at what we can potentially do to deliver more effect and more influence.</p>

<p>For example, ensuring we contribute more meaningfully to upstream conflict prevention in terms of capacity building, maritime security and that emerging International Defence Engagement Strategy.</p>

<p>Exactly what warships like HMS DAUNTLESS around the Gulf of Guinea can do.</p>

<p>And, of course, we must maintain a long-term ambition to ensure that, in the future, we can match the ‘spectrum of capability’ to the ‘spectrum of uncertainty’.</p>

<p>Again, just what highly capable warships, like HMS DAUNTLESS can do……and what equally capable Type 26 Global Combat Ships, the mainstay of the future Fleet, will be able to do.</p>

<hr>
<p>Keeping our sights focussed on the long-term is vital.  Because our measure of success in delivering security in an age of austerity is not just about delivering security now of course……it’s about delivering it in the next decade and beyond.</p>

<p>When the threat environment will certainly be more dynamic and more complex.</p>

<p>By the middle of only the next decade, the world will be very different to the one we understand today:</p>

<ul>
<li>it will have a billion more mouths to feed;</li>
  <li>almost everyone in Africa may have a mobile phone;</li>
  <li>and China will comprise around 30% of global GDP.</li>
</ul>
<p>So our measure of success will I think depend on whether or not we are ready to shape and respond to a world in geopolitical flux……around what some refer to as “pivotal regions”……regions, in which global trends (such as resource, energy, climate change and demographics) will converge, giving such regions an importance disproportionate to their geopolitical status.</p>

<p>In other words, it is such regions that are most likely to generate tensions that impact on global security.</p>

<p>They include the wider Middle East, the Asian Meridian, both Polar regions, the Korean peninsula, and sub-Saharan Africa.  And with the exception of the latter, they all have a strong maritime dimension.</p>

<p>So being ready for such change is the long-term test……for nations and navies on not just both sides of the Atlantic, but for maritime nations around the world.</p>

<h2 id="closing">[Closing]</h2>

<p>Before I draw to a close, amidst such challenges it is easy to become disheartened by the whiff of Dickensian austerity associated with my theme this evening.</p>

<p>So I want to leave you with just 2 brief illustrations of where delivering security and defence in an age of austerity still has the long term for our nation at its heart.</p>

<p>The first is the investment in Carrier Strike……which will give the UK the capability and readiness that a value for money Defence must provide ……especially when the cost of operating our carriers is marginal (just 1%) to the cost of building them.</p>

<p>In my view, £60M to operate the capability annually buys a considerable amount of international influence.</p>

<p>Already crewing up in Rosyth, the QUEEN ELIZABETH will, in 15 months time, be brought out of dock to commence sea trials in 2016……and to allow assembly of the PRINCE OF WALES to start, although large blocks of her are already under construction.</p>

<p>Equally impressive is the infrastructure work, in terms of jetties and seabed, in Portsmouth……as the City and Naval Base prepare to operate the sort of tonnage from her harbour not seen since the 1950s.</p>

<p>In just over 5 years from now, 5th generation F-35B Lightning jets will be flying from HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH.</p>

<p>And by the end of this decade, the first operational deployment will take place……and with it the UK will once again make the most of the utility of air power from the sea……because countries that have carriers use them.</p>

<hr>
<p>And because “the first duty of Government remains: the security of our country”……my second illustration concerns, “the UK’s ultimate insurance policy in this age of uncertainty”……our nuclear deterrent, which has provided security day in day out for over 43 years……not just for the UK of course, but as part of our contribution to NATO’s Collective Defence umbrella.</p>

<p>We must be mindful of the ongoing ‘Alternatives Study’……but one cannot overlook the recent commitment to award initial design contracts with BAE systems regarding the programme to replace the Vanguard class submarine.</p>

<p>Only a few months ago, the Prime Minister reiterated his commitment in the House to, as he put it…… “retaining an independent nuclear deterrent based on the Trident missile system” and emphasised his recognition that, again in his words, “being continuously at sea is a key part of our deterrent.”</p>

<hr>
<p>To which, in conclusion L &amp; G, I would add that “being continuously at sea” is an important part of conventional deterrence too……and especially in an age of austerity.  For it ensures:</p>

<ul>
<li>that the beacon of maritime cooperation burns brighter;</li>
  <li>that we build upon our contribution to ‘smart power’, especially in terms of upstream conflict prevention;</li>
  <li>and, with navies being ‘at sea’ and ‘at readiness’, it ensures that we remain a credible contingency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for listening and I look forward to your questions.</p>
