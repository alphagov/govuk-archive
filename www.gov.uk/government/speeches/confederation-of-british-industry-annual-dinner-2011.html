<p><em>Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version.</em></p>

<p>As you’ll know, this week’s Budget will set out the Government’s plans to go for growth.</p>

<p>And my Department has a huge role to play.</p>

<p>I’m very proud of our reputation as one of the most deregulating Departments in Whitehall.</p>

<p>Much of this has been cutting the red tape that local councils face from the central state from Comprehensive Area Assessment to Place Surveys, to National Indicator Sets.</p>

<p>We’ve also cut red tape on the voluntary sector - such as making it easier for local communities to hold street parties during the Royal Wedding.</p>

<p>And we’re cutting regulation and removing obstacles that local firms face.</p>

<p>I think the Department - like many others - hasn’t paid enough attention to business in the past.</p>

<p>But things are very different now.</p>

<p>One of the first things I did on arrival was to scrap Home Information Packs, an action which has cut the cost of selling a home.</p>

<p>I’ve scrapped the ports tax, stopping the unfair and retrospective imposition of backdated business rates on firms in ports, which threatened to sink our export trade.</p>

<p>I’ve removed Whitehall planning rules which compelled councils to hike up parking charges in town centres.</p>

<p>And I’ve also abolished plans for penalty taxes to be imposed on parking spaces at local supermarkets.</p>

<p>On rates, I’ve doubled small business relief for a year, and the law is being changed to make it easier for small firms to claim it automatically without continuously filling in forms.</p>

<p>And soon, I hope, it’ll be goodbye to more red tape.</p>

<p>I can reveal today I am actively considering scrapping the so-called Local Authority Two-Tier Code introduced by the then Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Where councils outsource functions, it required private firms to employ new workers on the same terms as the public sector workers who transferred across.</p>

<p>It has increased the cost to the taxpayer of providing public services, and is actively discouraging the creation of new jobs by private firms.</p>

<p>I can also announce that we will be relaxing regulations that have stopped developers converting disused commercial property into homes.</p>

<p>It’s in everyone’s interests to make it easier to turn run-down old eyesores into much-needed new homes. Let the market decide what’s best so far as housing is concerned.</p>

<p>I want Whitehall to get out of the way, and I want to work with councils and local firms to create local jobs and local growth.</p>

<p>I know some people are sceptical about localism.</p>

<p>Some even argue that growth is incompatible with localism.</p>

<p>But my answer is - was centralisation such a great success?</p>

<p>After years of regional house building targets house building fell to its lowest peacetime levels since 1924.</p>

<p>Too often, Whitehall targets had a perverse, unintended consequence.</p>

<p>National planning rules on density helped create an unsustainable glut of flats, worsening the shortage of family homes.</p>

<p>Targets on councils to assess planning applications by a set deadline encouraged them to refuse complex applications just to meet that deadline.</p>

<p>And laws like the 2004 Planning Act, and its requirement to provide volumes of Local Development Documents, made the planning system slower rather than faster.</p>

<p>All centralisation has done is create a completely unbalanced economy. Over reliant on particular industries. Over reliant on the public sector. Over reliant on a tiny fraction of our potential.</p>

<p>Through localism, we are putting power, responsibility and accountability back in the hands of people who know what they are doing.</p>

<p>Who understand their area.</p>

<p>Who know its strengths.</p>

<p>Who care about its future.</p>

<p>Because we believe in incentives rather than instructions.</p>

<p>In co-operation, rather than conflict.</p>

<p>So we’re giving communities a reason to say ‘yes’ to development and to new homes - because they’ll see the financial benefits.</p>

<p>It seems incredible to me that for years, we’ve had a system where at best, councils did not have a direct financial interest in what local businesses were up to and whether their fortunes went up or down.</p>

<p>And at worst, it’s like they deliberately set out to frustrate businesses with petty rules and regulations.</p>

<p>We are saying; clearly and unambiguously, local government should be positively supporting local businesses.</p>

<p>And we’re using the financial carrot, rather than the legal stick.</p>

<p>I think it’s a wonderful thing - by shaking up the business rates system, they’ve got a financial stake in the growth and creation of local firms.</p>

<p>Though of course - unless any of you tell me this is what you want - that doesn’t mean the green light to rack up the rates.</p>

<p>Instead, were saying to councils: you’ve got to take responsibility for promoting growth and enterprise.</p>

<p>Some seem to think that being pro-business has to mean being anti-green.</p>

<p>When in fact, it’s business that is at the cutting edge of low carbon technology.</p>

<p>Or that being anti-business means being anti-community.</p>

<p>Well growing a strong business environment isn’t a threat to a healthy community - it’s the foundation.</p>

<p>Councils have wanted greater freedom, greater flexibility, the chance to be in the driving seat.</p>

<p>But they have simply got to be prepared for the responsibility that comes with that.</p>

<p>It means if you want to get things done: don’t wait for Government to pass a law or sort it out for you. Get on with it.</p>

<p>Take that chance to work with the community in your shared interests - or risk the economic consequences of cowardice and indecision.</p>

<p>One of the biggest sources of friction between councils and business is the planning system.</p>

<p>The problem is - frankly - structural.</p>

<p>Today, there are something like 900,000 words in planning guidance.</p>

<p>That makes War and Peace look like light reading.</p>

<p>In fact, that’s more than the complete works of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>And, if we carried on at the same rate over the next Parliament, we’d have not just the complete works of Shakespeare but the Bible as well - both Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p>Just think, if Kirsty Young ever invites me on to Desert Island Discs, I’d be able to say give me the “complete planner”. I am confident that with each page turn I would increase my desire to be rescued.</p>

<p>The planning system should act as a driver for growth.</p>

<p>But if I am being completely frank with you, it’s the drag anchor to growth.</p>

<p>How many proposals disappear into the planning system, never to be seen again?</p>

<p>Millions of pounds are wasted.</p>

<p>Many months and years are lost to delays.</p>

<p>We need a system which supports growth: not shuts it down.</p>

<p>We need a system that always says yes to the right sorts of development.</p>

<p>Which gets to grips with the national housing shortage.</p>

<p>Which helps business grow and expand.</p>

<p>And which delivers the infrastructure, transport, and energy we need to thrive in this new century of ours.</p>

<p>We also need a system that is much more democratic.</p>

<p>When targets and plans are dreamed up in remote offices far from the places they are supposed to help, it’s no surprise that communities stamp their feet and say no.</p>

<p>In fact, there really is only one option. The only way they get listened to.</p>

<p>We’ve got a system that is largely predicated upon conflict, which sets up business, councils and communities as adversaries.</p>

<p>When I came into office is appeared to me that we have a planning process that function by appeal.</p>

<p>What we need is a system which encourages them to work together.</p>

<p>And let’s be clear, democracy must not, does not, come at the cost of delays.</p>

<p>Neighbourhood plans will involve every part of the community, businesses as well as residents, right from the very outset.</p>

<p>More agreement upfront means fewer wrangles later on.</p>

<p>We need a system which is much, much simpler.</p>

<p>At the moment, it’s a labyrinth. Few dare to enter. Even fewer survived unscathed.</p>

<p>Using the planning system shouldn’t feel like you’re going ten rounds with bureaucracy.</p>

<p>And we shouldn’t need an army of experts to navigate it.</p>

<p>I am absolutely determined to cut the planning system down to size.</p>

<p>Less the length of a Shakespearian tragedy, more the brevity of the Gettysburg address.</p>

<p>I want a system where both local residents and local councils see the benefits of development, and work together with local firms to shape the future of their community.</p>

<p>Despite billions of pounds thrown at Regional Development Agencies; we’ve still got huge inequality between different parts of the country.</p>

<p>I don’t believe regionalism worked.</p>

<p>We needed a new way of local firms and local councils working hand in hand to promote economic development.</p>

<p>Local Enterprise Partnerships have a radically different approach to economic development.</p>

<p>Putting local councils and local businesses in the driving seat.</p>

<p>It’s all about growth, not about grants.</p>

<p>And those local partnerships will be at the heart of new the Local Enterprise Zones.</p>

<p>Helping define exactly where we should cut taxes still further. And sweeping away the restrictions on growth. So that new businesses and new jobs can flourish.</p>

<p>With this kind of opportunity on offer, it is no wonder there has been a very positive response. Local enterprise partnerships now cover 90 per cent of the country.</p>

<p>To everyone involved it is obvious, they are moving at different rates.</p>

<p>But I don’t see anything wrong with that.</p>

<p>In fact, I think a bit of healthy competition, a bit of rivalry, is probably quite a good thing.</p>

<p>Now I know that some of you started off as sceptics about these new partnerships.</p>

<p>But what I really do appreciate is the way that the Confederation of British Industry and its members have worked with us.</p>

<p>And I know that discussions have happened with many of my officials - including my Permanent Secretary.</p>

<p>In truth I don’t mind a bit of disagreement. I am from Yorkshire a place that has made bluntness an art form. The Confederation of British Industry has been robust in your views on planning and growth.</p>

<p>I think we have ended up with something much better than what we started with.</p>

<p>That is thanks to you and your members who’ve been prepared to work with us.</p>

<p>I’m very grateful for that.</p>

<p>And I hope it’s just one of the areas where we’ll continue to work closely together in future.</p>

<p>I certainly believe that it’s important to get the question of local growth correct and through that to delvier a better Britain.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
