<hr>
<p><em>Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version.</em></p>

<p>I’m going to avoid all the obvious jokes about Guy Fawkes night.</p>

<p>No corny remarks about blowing up parliament or references to a bonfire of the quangos.</p>

<p>I’ll just stick to my little sparkler of a speech.</p>

<p>But I do just want to make one point before I start.</p>

<p>I was delighted to hear yesterday that the FBU had called off its strike which would have covered Bonfire Night and Diwali. I am glad that common sense has prevailed.</p>

<p>I think that a lot of people here today will have had grave reservations about the proposed strike. I hope the unions and employers can resolve this dispute in a more constructive way, without resorting to industrial action.</p>

<p>Let me get back to the main event.</p>

<p>There’s no denying the recent financial settlement was tough for councils. And you all knew it would be.</p>

<p>But though councils have less money - you also have far more power.</p>

<p>More influence. More choices. More opportunities. More freedom than you’ve had in decade. In truth more power than for a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>So make no mistake.</p>

<p>Even if the coffers were overflowing.</p>

<p>We’d still be doing this.</p>

<p>We’d still be passing power out - to local councils and to local communities.</p>

<p>Because it’s big government as well as big spending that got us into this financial mess.</p>

<p>And if you want to run better public services.</p>

<p>If you want to have a dynamic economy.</p>

<p>If you want to have strong local communities.</p>

<p>Then you don’t control everything from on high.</p>

<p>You need to put power back where it belongs.</p>

<p>You give councils control of the purse strings and let them make the decisions.</p>

<p>You stop tying councillors up with red tape and regulation and let them get on with it.</p>

<p>You give people a genuine reason to get involved in their community - in the knowledge that they can actually make a difference.</p>

<p>That’s what this settlement was about - power and influence as well as the raw figures.</p>

<p>It’s about making local communities stronger.</p>

<p>We’ve had more than a decade of central government pulling the strings. Look where it got us.</p>

<p>It’s time to give local government a try.</p>

<p>And London is showing how it’s done.</p>

<p>You get Redbridge - more open, more honest, more transparent - really getting the community involved in difficult choices.</p>

<p>You get Camden and Islington - looking at saving the public thousands of pounds by sharing a chief executive and senior management.</p>

<p>You get Hammersmith and Fulham, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea - demonstrating the future of local public services.</p>

<p>London councils are taking the lead.</p>

<p>Showing the future of local government.</p>

<p>And I believe that all of you can rise to this challenge.</p>

<p>All of you can innovate, save money - and give your residents a better deal.</p>

<p>Because the shackles of central government have been removed.</p>

<p>For the first time in living memory, you can genuinely make a difference to the lives of your residents.</p>

<p>Now that you don’t have the targets, the forms and the inspections to worry about.</p>

<p>You can get on with worrying about what your residents want.</p>

<p>And there are lots of areas where you will be in a stronger position by working together.<br>
Take pensions.</p>

<p>London boroughs control 33 pension funds worth something like £19 billion pounds.</p>

<p>Some councils are already working together to better manage their funds.</p>

<p>And something like £60 million could be saved if all pension funds were being run at the standard of the best.</p>

<p>Isn’t it about London councils look seriously at safeguarding their employees pensions through partnerships?</p>

<p>But there’s no reason why shared services should stop in the back office.</p>

<p>What we’re seeing in West London is three councils at the cutting edge of innovation.</p>

<p>Not just sharing HR, finance and buildings but looking at adult social care and children’s services too.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s been a lot of rubbish talked about ‘mergers’ and ‘super-councils’.</p>

<p>Nobody sensible is suggesting that’s on the table at all.</p>

<p>No-one’s saying that Kensington and Chelsea is going to be hoovered up, or that Islington is going to be taken-over.</p>

<p>Local identity, local accountability, local sovereignty is still paramount.</p>

<p>In fact, residents shouldn’t notice the difference at all - except that they should get better, more consistent local services.</p>

<p>A massive power shift is going on here. Localism is no longer a dirty word - it’s the only show in town.</p>

<p>After being the prisoner of central government for decade, this is now your time to shine and bask in the sun.</p>

<p>And I know some people find it hard to believe.</p>

<p>But this is real. This is happening.</p>

<p>I haven’t secretly got a hundred targets up my sleeve which I’ll produce if you don’t do exactly as I want.</p>

<p>I’m letting you get on with it.</p>

<p>And if you don’t deliver, it won’t be me turning up to darken your doorstep.</p>

<p>It will be your voters.</p>

<p>We’ve got a new balance of power now.</p>

<p>It means a new relationship between you and your residents.</p>

<p>Instead of turning to me asking ‘what should we do, Secretary of State?’ ‘am I doing this right?’ - you need to be asking them that question.</p>

<p>But you can only do that if you are genuinely open and transparent.</p>

<p>If you are prepared to be challenged and held to account.</p>

<p>But if you are confident in your decisions, if you believe in what you are doing, there’s no reason why you should need to hide behind closed doors.</p>

<p>Fifteen London councils have already put their spending online - so why can’t the others? What have you got you got to hide?</p>

<p>This new balance of power also means a new relationship between you and me.</p>

<p>I have spent a long time in local government. I trust you. I support you. And I want to be able to discuss the really difficult issues openly and honestly.</p>

<p>One of those is housing benefit - and what that will mean in London.</p>

<p>It’s raising a lot of questions and speculation. But let’s remember what we’re really talking about.</p>

<p>Fairness.</p>

<p>Is it fair that people’s taxes are being used to give other people 30, 40, 50 grand a year for housing benefit?</p>

<p>Is it fair that there hard working families living in your wards who can only dream of the homes enjoyed by some people living on benefits?</p>

<p>Is it surprising that this causes a lot of resentment?</p>

<p>It is time to live in the real world.</p>

<p>Housing benefit has gone up by £5 billion just in the last five years - up by 50 per cent in the last ten years.</p>

<p>It’s not only unfair - it’s completely unaffordable.</p>

<p>And we’ve got to be able to talk about this without the debate being hijacked by outlandish claims which only serve to whip up public hysteria.</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that there are tough times ahead. Difficult choices to make.</p>

<p>But you know and I know that we can’t make sensible, fair decisions, if we resort to myths and hysteria instead of the facts.</p>

<p>We need a discussion, not a media feeding frenzy.</p>

<p>You’ve got all these new powers, all this new influence.</p>

<p>Voters will want you to use them responsibly and sensibly.</p>

<p>London has a world-wide reputation for creativity, for innovation, for dynamism.</p>

<p>This great capital city needs councils who will live up to that reputation.</p>

<p>And I’m looking forward to seeing what you do.</p>
