<p>Thank you Mike for those kind words of introduction [Brigadier Mike Riddell-Webster, (Head of Capability (Ground Manoeuvre)] and for asking me to address your annual event.</p>

<p>I’m amazed to see from your slide and I quote it exactly: ‘find the money’. </p>

<p>If you can find me some more, I’d be grateful!</p>

<p>I’m delighted to see so many industry representatives here today. </p>

<p>Today is all about relationships: building them, cementing them, enhancing them.</p>

<p>Because our future is inexorably tied together in this post-<a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/sdsr"><abbr title="Strategic Defence and Security Review">SDSR</abbr></a> world.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Strategic Defence and Security Review">SDSR</abbr> is more than a nudge or a wake-up call; it is our epiphany. It offers a bold vision for defence in 2020 and beyond. </p>

<p>But, going back to that point about finding the money, right now there simply isn’t the money there was before.</p>

<p>Our armed forces need government and industry to work more closely than ever before.</p>

<p>And the taxpayer expects better value for money than ever before.  And believe me, I know from the letters I receive that they do.</p>

<p>These circumstances demand a new approach, and a new relationship between government and industry, based on clear priorities.</p>

<p>So I want to say a few words about the <abbr title="Strategic Defence and Security Review">SDSR</abbr> generally.</p>

<p>And I want to talk about how, together, we can deliver close combat capabilities to current operations, and build the capabilities required for what we call our Future Force 2020.  </p>

<p>Now, when we announced the <abbr title="Strategic Defence and Security Review">SDSR</abbr> on entering office in May, we knew that it heralded an unsettling period for us all in defence.</p>

<p>Because we all knew that change must come.</p>

<p>We knew this because the first fundamental re-think in 12 years would be meaningless if it failed to acknowledge a series of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>that we are in the midst of the biggest financial crisis in a generation</li>
  <li>that we inherited a national debt that was growing at a rate that could fund three Type 45 destroyers or an aircraft carrier a week</li>
  <li>that we also inherited some restrictive but binding, contractual arrangements</li>
  <li>that security and defence are indivisible these days</li>
  <li>and that we needed to increase investment in certain priority areas such as cyber security</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of this, we had to reach our conclusions without damaging essential capability, the military covenant or critical industrial capability.</p>

<p>And we had made a firm decision in opposition not to ‘salami slice’ across the board. </p>

<p>And we have achieved that largely.</p>

<p>So we had to face up to reality.</p>

<p>In this context, the fact that the defence budget is making a more modest contribution to deficit reduction than many other government departments shows the priority across government that we attach to national security.</p>

<p>But, as you know, we have had to take some very difficult decisions, decisions that we have taken no pleasure in, and decisions that I know have been painful for many people in our armed forces, the civil service and in industry.</p>

<p>And that’s why we needed some clear underpinning priorities.</p>

<p>We had two - you know what they are: protecting our mission in Afghanistan and setting a path to a coherent and affordable defence capability in 2020 and beyond.</p>

<p>Let me take these in turn.</p>

<h2 id="afghanistan">Afghanistan</h2>

<p>As you know, Afghanistan remains our main effort in defence.</p>

<p>As part of that, our challenge - indeed moral obligation, particularly for me - is to acquire the right equipment for our armed forces, at the right time, and at the right cost. </p>

<p>I want to pay tribute to everyone involved in making that happen - particularly industry’s help in delivering Urgent Operational Requirements. </p>

<p>In my view, a great success.</p>

<p>It’s a fantastic effort by all concerned, and is greatly appreciated by me and those serving in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>At the risk of singling out certain areas for special mention, I would like to highlight two:</p>

<p>Firstly, the real improvements we’ve seen in dismounted soldier equipment. Today’s front-line forces now have greatly improved firepower, sights, and targeting ability. And the dismounted soldier has never been better protected - as they’ve told me when I’ve visited Afghanistan. And I think that message is beginning to get across, even in the media.</p>

<p>This is only possible because of close and agile relationships with industry - for example, by prioritising our needs in your production lines so we can get this vital equipment where it’s needed most.</p>

<p>Second, the Protected Vehicle Programme. </p>

<p>In October, the six-wheeled Wolfhound vehicle joined Coyote and Husky in Afghanistan as the biggest of the tactical support vehicle family, and complements the Mastiff and Ridgback fleets really well.</p>

<p>The further protection offered by Wolfhound was a significant milestone for the range of vehicles our armed forces have at their disposal.</p>

<p>Carrying essential combat supplies such as food, water, and ammunition, the fleet is providing vital support to our forces on front-line patrols so that crucially they can stay out on the ground for longer.</p>

<p>So just a fortnight ago, I was delighted to announce the Light Protected Patrol Vehicle contract for Foxhound, which will replace the existing fleet of Snatch Land Rovers and Land Rovers with Weapons Mount Installation Kits deployed on operations in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>I’m particularly pleased and proud that it’s designed, developed, and made in Britain, and has been specifically developed by British engineers to meet the requirements of our armed forces. It is the culmination of many months’ hard work.</p>

<p>Now, that is months, not years - the speed of the process shows that the MOD is also learning some good habits from industry -  particularly in this case, as many of you will know, the motorsport sector.</p>

<p>Foxhound does not solve all our problems of protected mobility: that’s why we need a range of vehicles for this. But its world-beating balance of protection, weight and agility - for a vehicle of its class - and will greatly enhance our ability to interact with local populations, crucially without damaging local infrastructure. </p>

<p>And I have talked to people who have driven it who confirm it is as good as I claim it is.</p>

<h2 id="future-force-2020">Future Force 2020</h2>

<p>Our second <abbr title="Strategic Defence and Security Review">SDSR</abbr> priority was charting a course to Future Force 2020 and beyond.</p>

<p>For the Army, Future Force 2020 will be based around the new Multi-Role Brigade Structure. </p>

<p>We are still working through the specific details of how these brigades will be structured and equipped, but it is clear that there will still be a requirement for armour, reconnaissance forces and a range of protected vehicles. </p>

<p>Indeed, despite the cost cutting measures, we will be spending around £50 billion on equipment and support over the next four years.</p>

<p>And although we will be aiming to buy more off the shelf, as I’ve said on plenty of occasions, and as the Secretary of State and I have said on several occasions, we hope that shelf will include a plentiful supply of British products.</p>

<p>But taxpayers expect us to spend their hard-earned money wisely so that our armed forces have what they need, at the right time, to do the job we ask of them.</p>

<p>And we must diminish the dependence of British industry on the MOD budget so that it is not exposed to the vagaries of the budgetary cycle.</p>

<p>We therefore recognise the need to create a more stable base for industry, less dependent on the UK economy alone.</p>

<p>That’s why ministers are proud to support the biggest exports drive we have seen in decades.</p>

<p>And that’s why we will be imminently publishing a Green Paper -  which you have all heard about, I’m sure - which will set out our intended approach to Defence and Security Industrial and Technology policy.</p>

<p>The Green Paper will be structured into four parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Part 1 - a keynote essay addressing the principal themes of the Green Paper</li>
  <li>Part 2 - essays covering cross-cutting themes common to defence and security, including support for exports, <abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises">SMEs</abbr>, <abbr title="Science and Technology">S&amp;T</abbr> and international collaboration</li>
  <li>Part 3 - essays specific to defence, security and cyber-space. The defence section will include issues such as sector strategies and contractor support to operations - I’m very conscious of the fact that this is going to be hard</li>
  <li>Part 4 - details on the mechanics of consultation and the specific questions for which we are seeking views</li>
</ul>
<p>I thank those of you who have already provided input into our thinking, and I encourage all of you to contribute to the formal 12 week consultation period, which we expect to run between 5 January and 30 March.</p>

<p>We will be publishing our White Paper in the spring, which will formalise our approach until the next <abbr title="Strategic Defence and Security Review">SDSR</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has made the point that successful countries are not those who look inward or backward to former glory, but those who look outward and forward to future threats and future opportunities.</p>

<p>Now, the <abbr title="Strategic Defence and Security Review">SDSR</abbr> provides the template for success. But to succeed we do have to face reality. And we need world-class British industry, underpinned by flexible and responsive relations with government.</p>

<p>That’s why we’re all here today.</p>

<p>That’s why I am here today.</p>

<p>I’m sorry I can’t be here all day due to other commitments.</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing from the Brigadier what happens.</p>

<p>It will not be plain sailing - I would like to provide certainty in Defence but in an unstable world, we can’t.</p>

<p>But if we can create an environment with a high level of customer focus, agility and increased competition, these are just the qualities we need to respond to fast-moving military threats, drive better value for money and increase business opportunities.</p>

<p>And the armed forces that emerge ultimately from the <abbr title="Strategic Defence and Security Review">SDSR</abbr> will be one of the most powerful and sophisticated on the planet.</p>

<p>With your help and support, we can achieve this.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.</p>
