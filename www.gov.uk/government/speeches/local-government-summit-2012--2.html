<p><em>Transcript of the speech as delivered.</em></p>

<p>There is no greater responsibility, no higher priority for this Government than to get the nation back on track towards renewed, long-term, sustainable growth.</p>

<p>Growth puts people in jobs, keeps families in homes, makes our towns and cities great places to live.</p>

<p>Getting public spending under control has been vital and non-negotiable.</p>

<p>We’ve strained every sinew to do it in a way that protects the most vulnerable.</p>

<p>Today is Blue Monday - officially the most depressing day of the year, as people look ahead to months of chilly weather and paying back their Christmas bills.</p>

<p>This year, it will be tough for many people - facing pay freezes at work, be it in the public or private sector, as well as a rising cost of living.</p>

<p>This is why it’s essential in February and March, as town hall budgets are set, that councils sign up to the council tax freeze.</p>

<p>It’s practical help every councillor can offer to their ward constituents. A vote against the council tax freeze is a vote for punishing tax-rises. Local taxpayers will remember that decision next time they cast their vote at the ballot box.</p>

<p>Councillors have a moral duty to sign up to keep down the cost of living - anything less is a kick in the teeth to hard-working, decent taxpayers.</p>

<p>But cutting the deficit is only the first step.</p>

<p>We want to give investors confidence to invest.</p>

<p>Make it easy for entrepreneurs to bring their ideas to market.</p>

<p>Make Britain one of the best places in Europe, if not the world, to start and grow and business.</p>

<p>Now in the past, supporting growth might have been seen as a job for the Treasury and Business Department.</p>

<p>But we simply don’t have that luxury today.</p>

<p>This is a job for every part of Government.</p>

<p>Including my Department.</p>

<p>I am determined that the Department for Communities and Local Government should be at the forefront of creating the right conditions for local economies to thrive.</p>

<p>Not least because localism and growth are two sides of the same coin.</p>

<h3 id="localism-and-growth">Localism and Growth</h3>

<p>You can’t engineer, can’t manufacture growth through nationally-dictated plans and blueprints.</p>

<p>However well-meaning, however expertly devised, Regional Development Agencies simply didn’t deliver.</p>

<p>Even in the five years to 2008, before the crunch really bit, the number of private sector jobs fell in Birmingham, in Nottingham, in Sheffield, Bradford, Croydon and Leicester.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to impose growth from Whitehall, we want to encourage and celebrate local leadership, ingenuity, and enterprise.</p>

<p>Instead of the public sector going solo, we want to get councils and entrepreneurs working together.</p>

<p>So we’re creating the conditions for local leadership.</p>

<p>Local Enterprise Partnerships put civic leaders and local entrepreneurs in the driving seat as never before.</p>

<p>Partnerships now host two dozen Enterprise Zones - with tax breaks and simple planning rules to attract new firms.</p>

<p>Partnerships have advised firms bidding for the two point four billion pounds available under Regional Growth Fund - helping safeguard jobs everywhere from steelyards in Redcar, to biotechnology start-ups in Plymouth.</p>

<p>And now we’re reforming business rates, so that councils see a direct benefit to their own finances from boosting the local economy…</p>

<p>…and this will give every council every possible reason to work with businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>But perhaps the policy that best encapsulates the new approach is the Growing Places Fund.</p>

<p>Half a billion quid is up for grabs for local leaders to support enterprise, encourage businesses, create the conditions for local growth.</p>

<p>What have we asked Local Enterprise Partnerships to do to get their hands on it?</p>

<p>Not complete a form the size of a telephone directory…</p>

<p>Not report every five minutes on every step along the way…</p>

<p>But set out they want to do with the cash, and what they aim to deliver, in terms as simple as we could possibly make them.</p>

<p>It’s a process that is based on our trust in local leaders to deliver.</p>

<p>This means making tough decisions and putting the cash where it can make the biggest difference - not where it’s most expedient, or will appease the most people.</p>

<p>Get this right, vindicate our trust, and this could be the shape of things to come.</p>

<p>Get it wrong, and well - we’re back to the strings and guidelines, the gentle breath of the overseer tickling the hairs on the back of your neck.</p>

<h3 id="over-to-you">Over to You</h3>

<p>So the spotlight falls on you.</p>

<p>To a great extent, what happens in your area next is in your hands.</p>

<p>We’ve binned the guidance, the strictures, the blueprints.</p>

<p>As local leaders - whether in business or the Town Hall - for the first time in decades - you’ve got a clear run.</p>

<p>Your communities are looking to you to lead. To shape the future of your local economies.</p>

<p>Now after a little over a year of Local Enterprise Partnerships, there has been good progress.</p>

<p>Coventry and Warwickshire have worked with local banks to unlock finance for start-ups.</p>

<p>Tees Valley Unlimited are working with the UK’s Trade and Investment service to draw in foreign investment.</p>

<p>Places with Enterprise Zones, from Harlow to Hull, are getting on with the necessary to make them a success.</p>

<p>Manchester, for example, have unveiled their detailed plans for Airport City, with the potential to create twenty thousand new jobs, and dozens of firms are already keen to move in.</p>

<p>So on the one hand there’s a huge amount going on.</p>

<p>But on the other there’s absolutely no room for complacency - especially when we can all feel the chill winds blowing from the Continent.</p>

<p>So use today to galvanise your approach.</p>

<p>Some people have said, “we’d love to do our bit but we’d really like some more instruction.”</p>

<p>It’s a play: Waiting for Guidance.</p>

<p>But the best aren’t hanging around.</p>

<p>Look at the West of England.</p>

<p>They’ve not only secured an Enterprise Zone…</p>

<p>They’re also setting up “Enterprise Areas” too, with similar, straightforward planning rules, the better to attract new firms.</p>

<p>They didn’t wait to be told. They thought, “what can we do?” and they did it.</p>

<p>Some have said, “there’s money coming in but it’s going to our neighbours, or the upper tier, or the lower tier.”</p>

<p>Well then - cut a deal.</p>

<p>If you’re going to make the most of localism, you can’t waste time bickering.</p>

<p>The best will join forces.</p>

<p>Some will consider pooling their business rate incomes under the new system…</p>

<p>…sharing the risks and rewards, and helping everyone plan ahead.</p>

<p>If you’re not quite there yet - if you know in your heart of hearts that’s more you could be doing…</p>

<p>Really use today.</p>

<p>Look at your contemporaries in the room.</p>

<p>Learn from each other.</p>

<p>Challenge each other.</p>

<p>If there are people here you don’t know yet - get stuck in.</p>

<p>Who knows if that stranger isn’t the person who can make the links between your universities and business, between your exporters and new markets, between your entrepreneurs and lenders. </p>

<p>Above all, there is no point clinging to the old levers and approaches.</p>

<p>The world has changed.</p>

<p>Nobody’s going to try and force a solution on you.</p>

<p>Nobody’s going to stop you pursuing your own.</p>

<p>Be creative, be ambitious. Do what it takes to create the conditions for your economy to grow.</p>

<h3 id="what-it-means">What it Means</h3>

<p>I want to end by thinking about what’s at stake here.</p>

<p>Not too far from my constituency is the Ford plant at Dagenham.</p>

<p>As British engineering faltered towards the end of the last century, it became a symbol of decline.</p>

<p>Of glories past.</p>

<p>The kind of place that motorists snatch in glimpses as they hurtle past on the A13.</p>

<p>Now of course there are still challenges for British automotive industry.</p>

<p>But believe me, it’s on the way back.</p>

<p>In the year to last October…despite the tough conditions…despite the uncertainty in the markets…this country increased exports of vehicles by nearly twenty per cent.</p>

<p>Who’d have dreamt that ten years ago.</p>

<p>Dagenham, meanwhile, now produces a million engines each year, and employs four thousand people.</p>

<p>Creating the conditions for growth is about turning places like Dagenham from symbols of decline, to symbols of hope.</p>

<p>It’s about making space for new industries that give places a sense of purpose.</p>

<p>And about giving the people who look to you a reason to feel proud.</p>

<p>It goes back to why you’re here today.</p>

<p>I doubt very much that anyone gets into public affairs purely for the love of a beautiful spreadsheet, a snappy minute or a well-chaired committee.</p>

<p>We do it because we want to make change happen.</p>

<p>Today, you’ve got a golden opportunity to be the people who create growth, support jobs, underpin the prosperity and quality of life of the communities you work in.</p>

<p>It’s up to you to make the most of it.</p>
