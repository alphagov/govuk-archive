<h2 id="opening-remarks">Opening Remarks</h2>

<p>Many thanks for that introduction David (Prof David Begg, Transport Times).</p>

<p>And David, looking around tonight I can see that you’re someone who knows how to put on a great show.</p>

<p>But you’re also one of most recognised and respected voices in transport.</p>

<p>So, as well as thanking you and your colleagues for the hard work you’ve put into these impressive awards, I just wanted to express my personal gratitude for your contribution to transport down the years. Long may it continue.</p>

<p>I also want to say a big-thank you for asking me along to an event where I get to share the stage with Jeremy Vine.</p>

<p>Jeremy, it’s great to be on the “bill” with you tonight. Although, having looked at your CV, I am starting to feel a bit like a serious under-achiever.</p>

<p>There’s something important I want to say before anything else.</p>

<p>These awards remind us of the incredible job the people in the transport industry do.</p>

<p>So I just want you to know that this Transport Secretary and this Government recognise, value and appreciate everything you do.</p>

<p>While I have the chance I also wanted to say a very quick word about a subject the transport industry is very familiar with - and that’s change.</p>

<p>I realise that changing ministers can be disruptive.</p>

<p>And I know that transport has had its fair share of changes under all governments.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are said to be more former transport secretaries alive than for any other Cabinet job.</p>

<p>So I want to say this:</p>

<p>I am serious about transport.</p>

<p>It’s a job I wanted.</p>

<p>It’s a job where there is much to do.</p>

<h2 id="west-coast-mainline">West Coast Mainline</h2>

<p>It’s also a job where the challenges come thick and fast.</p>

<p>And, as Transport Secretary, I won’t be hiding from any of them.</p>

<p>There will be setbacks as well as successes.</p>

<p>This month, when we hit one on the West Coast line, I came straight out and confronted it.</p>

<p>The mistakes made with the West Coast Mainline franchise bid were deeply regrettable and completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>So I’ve ordered two independent reviews.</p>

<p>The first will report back by the end of this month, the second by the end of the year.</p>

<p>This is a serious issue, and it’s getting a serious response.</p>

<p>But let me be clear.</p>

<p>This is not about re-winding to a pre-privatisation past.</p>

<p>This is about learning lessons and moving forward with franchising so that future competitions are robust and deliver best value for passengers and tax payers.</p>

<p>And, while I’m on the subject of delivering value for money, there’s another challenge I’ve faced up to since taking this job - and that’s the cost of rail fares.</p>

<p>These are tough and testing times. And I want to help where I can.</p>

<p>So I’m pleased that I’ve been able to secure funds so that we can cut by 2% the planned increase in key rail fares. And not just for 2013, but for 2014 too.</p>

<h2 id="coming-home-to-the-dft">Coming home to the DfT</h2>

<p>Now, although I may be the new boy at these awards, this isn’t my first time at the Department for Transport.</p>

<p>I actually joined the Department in 1989, when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister.</p>

<p>I started off as Roads Minister</p>

<p>Then I became the Minister responsible for Aviation and Maritime.</p>

<p>Mind you, seeing as I was afraid of flying, as well as the MP for the most landlocked constituency in the country, “the Minister for Irony” might have been a more suitable job title.</p>

<p>Well I’m still proud to represent that same constituency</p>

<p>But I’m pleased to tell you that I’m totally cured of my fear of flying.</p>

<p>Now of course a lot of things have changed in the years since then.</p>

<p>I’ve certainly got more grey hair.</p>

<p>And I’ve definitely put on a few pounds.</p>

<p>But one thing remains exactly the same - and that’s the crucial importance of our transport links.</p>

<p>And that’s why I’m proud to come home to the DfT.</p>

<h2 id="introduce-myself">Introduce myself</h2>

<p>I have to say that I’m really excited too.</p>

<p>Excited about the transport milestones the Government has already reached in the first half of this Parliament.</p>

<p>But also excited about our big plans and bold ambitions for the second half of the Parliament and beyond.</p>

<p>So, I could use today’s speech to highlight our investment record - a Spending Review that committed £30 billion for transport projects right across the country.</p>

<p>I could explain how we’re speeding up journeys and cutting congestion on the roads with innovations like managed motorways.</p>

<p>Or, I could focus on our plans to electrify more than 850 miles of rail track.</p>

<p>I could talk about all the things we’re doing to devolve power and give local communities a real say about their transport.</p>

<p>Or I could tell you about our determination to build on Britain’s summer of cycling success - encouraging more people to take to two wheels and building safety into our roads. As I said in Birmingham this week, it’s something we need to act on.</p>

<p>I could even dedicate the entire speech to HS2.</p>

<p>A high speed rail network that isn’t just about taking 20 minutes off the journey to Birmingham, but is actually about shaping and transforming Britain for the next two hundred years.</p>

<p>A network that has cross party support, as well this Government’s full commitment.</p>

<p>A network that, like all big infrastructure projects in our history, starts off with controversy, but will end up being used and valued by everyone. Including the people who criticised it.</p>

<p>I could do all of that. But I won’t.</p>

<p>Because, rather than talk about transport policy to an audience of transport policy experts, what I’d really like to do is introduce myself properly…</p>

<p>To tell you a little bit about my approach to this job and the principles that will guide me over the coming months and years.</p>

<h2 id="the-secretary-of-state-for-all-of-transport">The Secretary of State for all of transport</h2>

<p>I should also tell you that that I’m not in the business of favouring railways over roads or maritime over aviation.</p>

<p>So, as we get the money in and the schemes underway.</p>

<p>As we rebuild, renew and reform.</p>

<p>I will be the Secretary of State for all of transport.</p>

<h2 id="reduce-the-hassle">Reduce the hassle</h2>

<p>The next thing you need to know about me is that I speak plainly. But I think big.</p>

<p>You won’t catch me using jargon like “calling points” instead of stations.</p>

<p>I’m ambitious about transport because I’m ambitious for Britain.</p>

<p>Transport is the artery of any economy.</p>

<p>It gets people to work, children to school and food to the shops.</p>

<p>When transport slows, everything slows.</p>

<p>When transport stops, everything stops.</p>

<p>Everyone depends on transport every day.</p>

<p>So when people ask: “what’s your aim in the job?”</p>

<p>My answer is straightforward - my task is to reduce the hassle of getting around.</p>

<h2 id="constructive-co-operation-common-ground">Constructive co-operation, common ground</h2>

<p>But I know that’s not a one-person job.</p>

<p>So I want to engage and work with the transport industry.</p>

<p>And I could summarise my approach in two words - constructive co-operation.</p>

<p>Coming together and working together on common ground.</p>

<p>The common ground where we can find workable solutions to the big transport challenges out there.<br>
That’s the approach I want to take.</p>

<p>Tonight is a celebration of your achievements and I know you’re keen to get on with it.</p>

<p>So it’s time I finished up. And as my wife always tells me - nobody will ever complain if a politician’s speech is too short.</p>

<h2 id="the-nominees">The nominees</h2>

<p>Before I conclude though, I just wanted to say something about the shortlist for this year’s awards.</p>

<p>And, to do that, I’d like to look back to this summer’s fantastic festival of sport, the 2012 London Games.</p>

<p>As far as I’m concerned, it wasn’t just our Olympians and Paralympians who delivered the goods.</p>

<p>Because, this summer our transport networks and our transport industry were put to the test like never before.</p>

<p>And they were brilliant.</p>

<p>So you should all feel rightly proud.</p>

<p>As indeed should tonight’s nominees.</p>

<p>Tonight’s short-list ranges from small local initiatives to big national projects.</p>

<p>And from teams who developed innovations in transport technology…to individuals who radically improved customer service.</p>

<p>Every nominee is different.</p>

<p>But, having seen that short-list, I know that you all share something in common - excellence.</p>

<h2 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h2>

<p>Some people wonder all their lives if they make a difference.</p>

<p>Well, that’s not a problem for tonight’s nominees, or indeed for anyone working in this country’s transport industry.</p>

<p>Because in making a difference to transport you are making a difference to Britain.</p>

<p>That’s why it’s an honour to share this special evening with you.</p>

<p>That’s why it’s great to be back at the DfT.</p>

<p>And that’s why I’m looking forward to working with all of you.</p>

<p>And on that note it just remains for me to thank-you for listening and to wish good luck to everyone who’s waiting nervously to hear if they’ve won an award.</p>

<p>Thank you very much and have a great night.</p>
