<p>MR BELLINGHAM’S SPEECH ON PROSPERITY AND NIGERIA, LAGOS</p>

<p>The UK Prosperity Agenda – growth, open markets and good governance</p>

<p>Very pleased to be here at the Deputy High Commissioner’s Residence 
in Lagos, on my first visit to Nigeria as the UK’s Minister for Africa. 
Today, I want to talk about the UK’s Prosperity Agenda and what the UK 
aims to achieve in partnership with Africa, and specifically with 
Nigeria. I want to talk about how we will work together to achieve those
 aims, including improving access to markets and championing the 
governance reforms that go hand-in-hand with economic growth.
Last December I set out this agenda in a speech at Lancaster house in
 London.  My key message was that we need to recognise the great 
opportunities available in Africa. Of course we want British businesses 
to make the most of the trade and investment opportunities on offer but 
more importantly we want African countries themselves to harvest the 
fruits. It is in all our interests to turn these opportunities into 
sustained growth. Nigeria is in a prime position to achieve this: 
according to latest figures the economy is projected to grow by 7.4% in 
2011. With the right reforms and approach from government that growth 
can stimulate further opportunities for business and make a real 
difference to the lives of millions of Nigerians.
The UK Government firmly believes that open and free trade is the way
 to increase global wealth. We have recently published a Trade and 
Investment White Paper that makes this case clear. In particular, it 
sets out our ambitions on the Doha Development Agenda, our commitment to
 ensure that developing countries can access trade finance, and our 
support for stronger African regional integration through the African 
Free Trade Initiative. </p>

<p>But regional agreements can only go so far, which is why Doha is 
vitally important. The current Doha negotiations are potentially worth a
 staggering £110bn to the world economy annually. Remember that this 
round was based on the principle of ensuring that it wasn’t just the 
developed countries that would benefit: developing countries need to see
 real benefits too. So 2011 is a make or break year for Doha. All 
countries, including Nigeria, have a role to play in ensuring that we 
reach a conclusion that stands to benefit everyone.</p>

<p>Where Nigeria fits in to the UK agenda</p>

<p>These last few days I have been able to meet with many of Nigeria’s 
political leaders of all affiliations. One clear theme ran through those
 discussions: the strong will and resolve to develop a renewed 
partnership between the UK and Nigeria that builds prosperity for both 
our countries on the solid base of our long established friendship.
And with good reason. We are partners on the global stage. The UK and
 Nigeria both sit on the Security Council of the United Nations this 
year and we have been working hard together in New York to address 
shared challenges to global stability. A telling recent example has been
 Cote d’Ivoire, where Nigeria has spoken with a strong voice to defend 
the principle of democratic succession.
It is around such values and principles that our countries come 
together as members of the Commonwealth, to which the UK Government has 
pledged renewed attention and resources. We look forward to working with
 Nigeria at the Heads of Government meeting in Perth and beyond to 
reinvigorate this unique family of nations which promotes democratic 
values, development and prosperity.
And Nigerians in diaspora play such a significant role within that 
family. In the UK, Nigerians are prominent in every sector of society; 
in law and medicine in sport and music– and in politics. Increasingly 
British Nigerians are re-investing in Nigeria. I want to encourage that 
enterprise, and deepen my own engagement; something I plan to do over 
the coming months.
In my opening remarks I said I wanted to see British businesses 
making the most of opportunities in Africa. The potential here in 
Nigeria is huge. One of the world’s leading financial analysts at 
Goldman Sachs recently predicted that, with the right reforms, Nigeria 
would be the world’s fifteenth largest economy by 2050.<br>
And Nigerians can make that happen. Nigeria’s population – the 
largest in Africa - is young, dynamic, and entrepreneurial.  I want to 
encourage British companies to forge partnerships with Nigeria, 
exporting their goods and expertise, in education, construction, 
financial services, and the energy sector to a willing partner. Some 
British companies are already here: Standard Chartered Bank, Diageo, PZ 
Cussons, JCB and many more have major investments in Nigeria, and that’s
 without mentioning the oil and gas industry. But there is scope for 
more.</p>

<p>Nigerian progress on governance reform</p>

<p>Here in Lagos, I am seeing that economic potential being realised 
hand-in-hand with improved governance. In my short time in this city, I 
have been struck by its size and strategic significance as well as its 
dynamism, energy and abundant optimism. I do not underestimate the 
challenges for those charged with the responsibility of running it and 
planning its future, given its rapid growth and the demands placed on 
the public services, environment and critical infrastructure.
But it’s clear to me from my meetings how far the current  State 
Administration under Governor Fashola has brought the city in a 
relatively short time – and based primarily on tax revenues. Improved 
business-friendliness, including in security and infrastructure, are 
factors that make an impact internationally and will attract the 
attention of worldwide investors – as we have already seen in terms of 
record levels of commercial enquiries from the UK.
Progressive policies make a genuine difference too. For example the 
openness to public-private partnerships, business-friendly tax regimes, 
and a clear commitment to accountability in public office all contribute
 towards growth. While some features of Lagos are unique –the size and 
productivity of its port and population - but what is happening here is 
raising the bar of accountability and performance for other States and 
cities too. The UK is excited about Lagos. We want to be a part of its 
future, as it grows in African and global importance.
The reforms necessary to enable economic growth and attract 
investment are also being made at the national level. The UK applauds 
Central Bank Governor Sanusi’s drive to address the widespread financial
 malpractice that had threatened to undermine Nigeria’s banking system.
One of his first acts was to commission a sector-wide audit that 
exposed significant frailties and diminished capital bases across 
several banks: the latter the result of imprudent and sometimes improper
 lending. This has led to the removal, and in some cases prosecution, of
 eight CEOs.
He has now established an Asset Management Company to soak up some of
 the sector’s remaining bad debt and to encourage a return to private 
sector lending. International recognition has followed: Governor Sanusi 
was recently named Central Bank Governor of the Year for Sub-Saharan 
Africa by Emerging Markets Magazine. This is deserving recognition for 
the pace, quality and courage of reform that he has brought about.
I know many of you here will agree that Nigeria’s power and energy 
sectors require both legislative reform and investment if they are to 
act as a force multiplier for the economy.  President Jonathan has 
recently expressed confidence that a new Petroleum Industry Bill may be 
passed before the end of the current legislative session in May. 
Bringing about a more coherent regulatory structure and improving 
transparency in the industry is greatly needed. At the same time, it’s 
important that any Bill encourages further necessary investment that 
will allow Nigeria to take full advantage of its natural resources in a 
sustainable, responsible way.
The President has also made progress on improving domestic power 
supply a priority, launching a Power Road Map last summer. I am sure 
that British firms will be competing hard to bring their expertise to 
this ambitious project. We want to help keep the lights coming on all 
over Nigeria.</p>

<p>The UK’s Prosperity plans in Nigeria</p>

<p>For all the reasons I’ve mentioned today, the UK is committed to 
making our Prosperity agenda work here in Nigeria. There are two main 
strands to that: upping the tempo of our commercial engagement, and 
working with Nigeria on the reform programmes necessary to create the 
enabling environment for growth.
On the first strand, my ambition- and I firmly believe we can achieve
 it- is to double bilateral trade by 2015. My visit here, during which I
 have taken the opportunity to talk with the leaders of the Nigerian 
business community, signals the start of a year of renewed commercial 
engagement by the British Government.
Next month, I will speak at an event to promote British investment in
 Nigeria at Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, and the next day 
we’ll hold another event at Old Trafford in Manchester. The Lord Mayor 
of the City of London will visit Nigeria later in the year and UK Trade 
and Investment will continue to drive forward their hugely successful 
work to introduce UK firms to the market.
Let me provide you with an example of the work they do: UKTI has 
recently forged a link with Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the world’s foremost 
credit agency. One of the most difficult aspects of doing business in 
Nigeria, indeed around the world, is how to build trust between 
different companies; Nigeria has suffered as a result of a poor 
reputation. This provides a process so that UK companies can commission a
 D&amp;B report on any company that approaches them. The D&amp;B number 
is then valid worldwide and gives the company credibility. In reverse we
 encourage Nigerian companies to ensure validation by applying for a 
D&amp;B number. We are officially launching the process in March 2011.
I’ve already spoken about the importance of Doha. The Prime Minister 
urged action to conclude the Doha Development round this year when he 
spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. We’ll keep 
working on that too.
But to reap the long term benefits of trade and investment, it is 
very important that the UK works with Nigeria on the second strand of 
the Prosperity agenda to promote good governance, including through 
economic and democratic reforms. These reforms will underpin sustainable
 growth for Nigeria.
Our Department for International Development is already very active 
in Nigeria. Its programmes have raised incomes for farmers and are 
expanding access to financial services and creating jobs in targeted 
sectors. Advisory work on infrastructure and business is creating the 
conditions for more private sector investment and wealth creation.
In recent weeks and months, events in Tunisia, Egypt and Cote 
d’Ivoire have renewed the world’s attention to the principles of 
democracy and self determination. The UK firmly supports democracy and 
believes that believe that individuals should be free to make choices 
about how their life is governed.
We want to help embed Nigeria’s democratic structures and so are 
committed to working with Nigeria to deliver credible and peaceful 
elections in April.  We have worked with electoral experts, with civil 
society, with the judiciary, national assembly and the national 
electoral commission to help achieve that, and to build those 
institutions for the long term.
In my meetings this week, I have urged Nigerian leaders to deliver 
the open and peaceful elections that they have promised, and that 
Nigerians deserve. That means campaigns free from inflammatory rhetoric 
and hate speech, and zero tolerance for any attempts to manipulate the 
outcome. Our Prime Minister, our Foreign Secretary and the Commonwealth 
Secretariat who visited this country in recent weeks have all given the 
same messages over the last six months. It is now time for Nigeria’s 
leaders to make good on their promises. The world is watching.
We are convinced that well-run elections, in which Nigerians can 
credibly choose their new Government and elected representatives at all 
levels, represent the path to a prosperous and peaceful future. I can 
assure you that the UK, with partners in the international community, 
will do all we can to support that process.
As I have said this morning, the UK’s prosperity agenda is about 
partnerships that build growth in our own countries and in the global 
economy. This week, I heard a Nigerian proverb that says “A man cannot 
sit down alone to plan for prosperity.”  I am determined that today and 
in the future, the UK and Nigeria will sit down together. Thank you.</p>
