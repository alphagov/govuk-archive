<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Britain wouldn’t be the place it is today without the contribution of people from ethnic minority backgrounds.</p>

<p>Think of the Commonwealth soldiers who served with the allies in the wars.</p>

<p>Think of the immigrants, people like my dad, who came here to build up our industries in the mid 20th century.</p>

<p>Think of our diverse communities contributing to every section of society today.</p>

<p>Think of Mo Farah. Our national hero.</p>

<p>When Mo crossed the finish line - twice - this summer.</p>

<p>The nation got behind this London lad. </p>

<p>No one batted an eyelid over the fact that he was a Somali-born Muslim.</p>

<p>After all, this guy is British - very British.</p>

<p>As he told one interviewer: “Look mate, this is where I grew up.</p>

<p>“This is my country and when I put on my Great Britain vest I’m proud.”</p>

<p>It said a lot about the diverse, integrated state of our country today.</p>

<p>Where everyone - black, white and brown - was proud to drape themselves in red, white and blue.</p>

<p>But despite great individual examples, there are still barriers to integration.</p>

<p>And today this is more of a problem for us as a country.</p>

<p>Why? Because today Britain is in a global race.</p>

<p>And we can’t just rely on Mo Farah to win this one for us.</p>

<p>It’s a race that pits us against counties around the world.</p>

<p>It’s a huge challenge of global, economic competition that will determine our future.</p>

<p>And we have got a secret weapon to succeed in the global race.</p>

<p>The races from around the globe that make up Britain today.</p>

<p>Our diverse communities.</p>

<p>People with links to places across the world, with business acumen and ideas, with cultural insight and experience and with endless untapped talent and networks.</p>

<p>It’s our duty - it’s crucial to our future - to unlock this potential.</p>

<p>And it flies in the face of the survey in which 52% of people said that migrants in Britain were bad for our economy.</p>

<p>So today I want to focus on what the barriers are to integration and how we can overcome them.</p>

<h2 id="barriers">Barriers</h2>

<p>First, let’s look at the barriers.</p>

<p>I believe that the things that stop people getting on with each other are the same as the things that stop them getting on in life.</p>

<p>In other words, integration and social mobility are inextricably linked.</p>

<p>Take language.</p>

<p>Some ethnic minority groups have much lower levels of English than others.</p>

<p>15% of Bangladeshi and 12% of Pakistani women report having little or no English.</p>

<p>Research shows that English language is the second biggest predictor in occupational success, after qualifications.</p>

<p>And 60% of people believe that the biggest barrier to being integrated is not speaking the language.</p>

<p>We need to get on top of this.</p>

<p>The solution isn’t to throw money at translation and interpretation services or at teaching assistants for non-English speaking pupils.</p>

<p>It’s helping more people to learn English.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m delighted at my department’s commitment to fund English language learning.</p>

<p>And it’s why I want to see us go further, finding new and innovative ways to help people learn English.</p>

<p>Whether it’s a DVD at home, a CD in the car, a volunteer at the community centre, or an after-school club.</p>

<p>Because a common language is the fundamental basis of common understanding.</p>

<p>It’s not just language that holds the key to integration. It’s also got to start in our schools.</p>

<p>There were huge gaps in attainment on the basis of ethnicity.</p>

<p>With British Caribbean, British Pakistani and British Roma children falling way behind the national average.</p>

<p>So what does this mean?</p>

<p>It means freeing up communities to start free schools in areas of deprivation, like the King’s Academy in Bradford, so that everyone, whatever their background, has access to the best schooling.</p>

<p>It means supporting failing comprehensives to become Academies, so that hard done by catchment areas suddenly get the best facilities and the best chances.</p>

<p>It’s also means changing the way we support and engage with different communities to bring them into the fold - not leave them out in the cold.</p>

<p>This government has moved away from intervention on the basis of race towards increasing the impact of mainstream policies on minority communities.</p>

<p>Backing mainstream organisations, like Youth United, which bring together people of all backgrounds.</p>

<p>And championing National Citizens’ Service. </p>

<p>Not just funding national bodies, but also supporting local projects.</p>

<p>My good friend, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, has led the way in this endeavour.</p>

<p>Spearheading the Big Lunch and the Bandstand Marathon, which have brought people together over food and music - shared experience in shared spaces.</p>

<p>Championing A Year of Service and the Near Neighbours programme, which have united people of different faiths so they can make a difference, together. </p>

<p>And driving forward the Localism Act, so people can bid to run local services and shape the areas in which they live. </p>

<p>This sends out a clear message to our BME communities.</p>

<p>No longer are you getting the crumbs off the table.</p>

<p>You now have a stake in the cake.</p>

<h2 id="values">Values</h2>

<p>Second, let’s look at our values.</p>

<p>For people to integrate in our society, I think Britain needs to be better at asserting its values.</p>

<p>Back in 2006, Tony Blair urged minority communities to adopt British values and to integrate.</p>

<p>But he forgot to point out that Britain needs to be equally sure of its values.</p>

<p>As a nation, we need to be stronger about asserting shared British principles</p>

<p>Like freedom, fairness and responsibility.</p>

<p>Opportunity, aspiration and tolerance. </p>

<p>Doing as you would be done by, being proud of the country in which you live.</p>

<p>How can we ask people to sign up to our values if we are not sure of them ourselves?</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve been so outspoken on Britain remembering its Christian heritage.</p>

<p>It’s why I went to the Vatican and called on Europe to assert its Christian identity.</p>

<p>If Christian Britain was more sure of its own identity it would be less rejecting of the other.</p>

<p>And I believe this government’s pro-faith agenda has reflected that.</p>

<p>With Britain, once again, growing confident of its Christianity.</p>

<p>And that’s why I’ve been so outspoken on the need for schools to teach history.</p>

<p>And I’m delighted that Michael Gove has put history at the heart of our curriculum. </p>

<p>Because, as I’ve said for years, how can we know where we’re going if we don’t know where we come from?</p>

<p>But not only must we assert our values - we must ensure those values are afforded to everyone, whatever their faith, colour or creed.</p>

<p>For too long authorities have dismissed many of the more difficult issues facing minority communities.</p>

<p>Some said “don’t meddle in these matters”.</p>

<p>Others steered well clear for fear of offending.</p>

<p>We’ve been treating our communities like foreign embassies.</p>

<p>Where rules from abroad apply and wider society keeps well out of it.</p>

<p>And for too long, cultural sensitivities have often led our leaders to become morally blind.</p>

<p>I believe we’ve dealt with matters differently.</p>

<p>When it came to forced marriage, we said enough was enough.</p>

<p>It’s the same with the issue of drugs.</p>

<p>Where a drug is harming a specific communities it’s not enough to say it’s part of their cultural practice.</p>

<p>It’s right to say they deserve the same protection from harmful drugs like everyone else.</p>

<p>And that is why for many years I have campaigned for the banning of khat.</p>

<p>Likewise we should come down equally hard on attitudes that can lead to tragic consequences.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I spoke out on the issue of child sexual grooming.</p>

<p>I said that a small minority of predominantly Pakistani men thought women were second class citizens and white women were third class.</p>

<p>Because if we shy away from the difficult issues in this country, however uncomfortable, we will never confront them.</p>

<p>And how can people integrate in a society when, in the name of cultural sensitivity, we continue to entrench barriers?</p>

<h2 id="discrimination">Discrimination</h2>

<p>Third, let’s look at discrimination.</p>

<p>Discrimination, intolerance, prejudice and bigotry.</p>

<p>We need to stamp these out if we want our society to be better integrated.</p>

<p>These un-British traits mean that at best some people feel they don’t belong and at worst their lives and livelihoods are under threat.</p>

<p>So in 2010, we made it a requirement for all police forces to record anti-Semitic attacks.</p>

<p>We are funding tighter security measures in Jewish faith schools.</p>

<p>We appointed the first UK Envoy for Post-Holocaust issues, Sir Andrew Burns.</p>

<p>We are funding the Holocaust Education Trust’s Lessons from Auschwitz project.</p>

<p>And are committing further funds to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.</p>

<p>And more than that - we are now finally starting to tackle the more recent scourge of anti-Muslim hatred.</p>

<p>As we announced last week, we are funding the Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks (MAMA) programme.</p>

<p>And we established the Cross Government Anti-Muslim Hatred Group, allowing us to respond to the growing problem of Islamophobia, department by department.</p>

<p>Fighting bigotry and intolerance is key to enable people to integrate, to participate and to reach their full potential.</p>

<h2 id="future-of-britain">Future of Britain</h2>

<p>We can’t afford to let people be held back.</p>

<p>Be it by language, by education, by discrimination, by disengagement.</p>

<p>As I have said, Britain’s migrant communities are key to our future.</p>

<p>Who better to sell Britain to the world than our diverse communities?</p>

<p>Whose links extend from Ankara to Islamabad, from Shanghai to Saint-Lucia.</p>

<p>Who better to offer the world the products it wants?</p>

<p>Than the country that sells naan bread to India; canoes to the Eskimos; tacos to Mexico.</p>

<p>Who better to rebalance our economy and accelerate our recovery?</p>

<p>Than some of our most can-do businessmen and women.</p>

<p>Our diaspora communities and entrepreneurs hold the key to linking businesses across continents.</p>

<p>Lady Thatcher once said: “Britain is now, more than ever, a multicultural society: and I think that we are beginning to appreciate the challenges and opportunities for learning that this diversity offers.</p>

<p>“A new resilience derived from diversity can only strengthen Britain.”</p>

<p>She was right.</p>

<p>Estimates show that our economy is missing out on £8.6 billion a year - probably more - from failing to fully empower people from ethnic minorities.</p>

<p>Imagine what Britain could do if we unlocked all that untapped talent.</p>

<p>So we need to break down these barriers.</p>

<p>Expose those opportunities and those values.</p>

<p>Bring people in from the sidelines, into the mainstream.</p>

<p>So the young black British boy doesn’t think he’s more likely to fail at school and less likely to get on in life.</p>

<p>But realises that he is not part of the problem, he’s part of the solution.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>David Cameron has called on us to become an aspiration nation if we want to win the global race.</p>

<p>I believe we also need to be an integration nation.</p>

<p>Taking away those barriers that stop people playing their part.</p>

<p>Asserting shared British values – and affording everyone those values.</p>

<p>Removing discrimination, tackling bigotry and hatred, wherever they arise.</p>

<p>And, crucially, unlocking the full talent of Britain’s diversity - a diversity which is so essential to our country’s future prosperity. </p>
