<p>Thank you David [David Olney, Deputy Chief Executive, Defence Estates] for that kind introduction.</p>

<p>I was once introduced as “Lord Astor of Heaven”, so I’m pleased you avoided that trap!</p>

<p>Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen. </p>

<p>The Prime Minister has said that he wants this to be the greenest Government ever. </p>

<p>And we are absolutely committed to achieving this.</p>

<p>But the public rarely equate Defence with being environmentally friendly; with nurturing, protecting, and conserving. </p>

<p>As a farmer, I have always taken a close interest in the management of the Defence Estate, so I know this to be patently untrue.</p>

<p>That’s why I am delighted to be presenting this year’s Sanctuary and Energy Awards which shine a light into the tremendous work that Defence is doing in these areas. </p>

<p>The Awards recognise the achievements of teams and individuals across Defence who have ‘gone the extra mile’ to make a real difference to heritage, fauna and flora, and conservation management across the estate.</p>

<p>And the inaugural Energy Awards recognise people’s efforts to conserve energy and cut carbon emissions. </p>

<p>The Award citations will be read out in a few minutes, and I hope you enjoy hearing them as much as I’ve enjoyed reading them.  </p>

<p>But I’d like to use this opportunity to say a bit more about the new government’s commitments, and offer some observations on the awards. </p>

<p>Before I do, let me just make some wider observations about the work of Defence Estates.</p>

<p>I know that delivering a service can often be a thankless task. </p>

<p>People take it for granted when things are going well, but you will soon hear from them when they’re not. </p>

<p>But it’s right not to rest on our laurels - if 95% of surveyed properties in the UK are either Standard one or two, that is excellent news, yet it also means that 5% is not up to standard. </p>

<p>It doesn’t mean that 95% of people are totally satisfied either.<br>
Improving the quality of life for Service personnel and their families matter, so let me thank all those concerned for their efforts to raise the bar still further. </p>

<p>Defence Estates also does a great deal for Defence by taking a sustainable approach to our estate. </p>

<p>For example, the positive PR and income you generate by giving film and television programme makers access to locations, personnel, and equipment - from ‘Songs of Praise’ to ‘Myths of UFOs’!</p>

<p>On behalf of the Ministerial team, I want to thank everyone connected with the Defence Estates organisation for all that you do. </p>

<p>I am also delighted to launch this year’s Sanctuary Magazine, the MoD’s annual conservation magazine, which for the first time will be solely available online.</p>

<p>The magazine is unique. </p>

<p>The articles are fascinating and show that this Department cares about nature conservation, heritage, and public access to the estate.</p>

<p>The stewardship of the Defence Estate is clearly in good hands.</p>

<p>And I’d like to thank the Editor, Clare Backman, for producing another outstanding edition.</p>

<p>The Coalition Agreement states unequivocally that climate change is one of the gravest threats we face, and mitigating and adapting to this change is one of the Government’s central priorities.</p>

<p>It is a challenge which every part of Government must rise to; Defence is no exception. </p>

<p>For example, we are committed to cutting emissions from greenhouse gases and reducing our carbon footprint. </p>

<p>The Department has done well, and I applaud all those who helped us to deliver the Government target of a 12.5% reduction in CO2 emissions two years early. </p>

<p>It is the same story with the condition of our Sites of Special Scientific Interest - we’ve met our targets ahead of the formal target date.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister has talked at length about his vision of a ‘Big Society’. </p>

<p>He describes it as being “about government helping to build a nation of doers and go-getters, where people step forward not sit back, where people come together to make life better.</p>

<p>There is no better example than the thousands of people who make up the large and dedicated network of volunteer conservation groups, and whose conservation management skills are widely admired. </p>

<p>Or our people and partners working together and taking initiatives towards the goal of a more sustainable environment and a more engaged society.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, I am very proud of what’s being done across the estate, but we’re here today to honour the people who have gone that little bit further in conservation and smart energy use. </p>

<p>And a few themes caught my eye as I read the Award citations. </p>

<p>You’ve challenged assumptions, you’ve taken decisions, and you’ve made changes that have led to positive benefits for the environment and, in many cases, saved the taxpayer considerable sums of money! </p>

<p>You were told that it was impossible to reduce energy consumption, or improve a Site of Special Scientific Interest in a danger area - yet you went ahead, you found answers, you delivered solutions. </p>

<p>This must have been satisfying - there’s nothing like telling a big business that it’s got it wrong!</p>

<p>We need champions who marshal good arguments and who are persuasive. </p>

<p>There are obviously some strong characters here amongst the award winners!</p>

<p>And while most people do want to make a difference, it sometimes needs champions to encourage and enable this change. </p>

<p>Broad behavioural change is essential if we are to sustain the improvements that you have started. </p>

<p>Yes, we need the technology of Building Energy Management Systems, for example, but the changes will only stick if our people modify their own behaviour. </p>

<p>When they do, the results are impressive: over quarter of a million pounds in reduced energy costs at just one RAF station.</p>

<p>Today we honour the best of the best in the MoD’s approach to the environment. </p>

<p>Agility, lateral thinking, and responding to change are the hallmarks of today’s winners. </p>

<p>And with these qualities, I believe that Defence can lead the way across Government. </p>

<p>Indeed, as the second largest landowner in Britain, we must.</p>

<p>With some 240,000 hectares, 45,000 buildings, and areas of outstanding natural beauty, we have the raw materials.</p>

<p>Because of the financial situation we have been left with, we will need to do more with less across Defence. </p>

<p>That’s why the work that all of you do, and which we are recognising today, is such an important part of our future. </p>

<p>Thank you again, and over to you David for the formal presentations.</p>
