<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen - distinguished guests. It’s an absolute pleasure to be here to make a small contribution to a big event.</p>

<p>This awards ceremony is now in its 5th year and it is clear that the audience is getting bigger every year.</p>

<p>I am pleased to see that there is a strong overseas contingent here tonight. I do hope they will enjoy their stay and find some time in their schedules to travel on a couple of our light rail systems.</p>

<p>I’m also delighted to be sharing the stage with Nick Owen.</p>

<p>Nick is, of course, one of the most familiar faces on TV.</p>

<p>Over the years his journalistic skills have graced ITN, Channel 4 and the BBC.</p>

<p>He has also danced his way across our screens as a contestant on ‘Strictly Come Dancing’.</p>

<p>I’m not going to be drawn on whether he was better than my fellow Lib Dem Minister Vince Cable.</p>

<h2 id="light-rail---a-good-news-story">Light Rail - a good news story</h2>

<p>Nick doesn’t only have an interest in ‘tripping the light fantastic’ - he’s also a big fan of light rail.</p>

<p>So much so, that he is actually the voice of the Croydon Tramlink, where his dulcet tones announce each stop.</p>

<p>Regular users of that service will be relived to know there is no truth whatsoever in the rumour that I’m about to replace him.</p>

<p>What is true though is that, just like Nick, I am a fully paid up member of the light rail supporters club.</p>

<p>Which is a very happy coincidence, seeing as I’m also the minister responsible for this particular mode of travel?</p>

<p>I’m proud to say that I have been a champion of light rail in and out of ministerial office - and for two main reasons.</p>

<p>First, because I know that this is a transport system with a long and successful history - in fact, it has over a century of development and experience behind it.</p>

<p>But second, because I believe it’s also a transport system with a bright future - and that’s something we can see for ourselves right here in Britain, from Croydon to Sheffield, from the Midlands to Tyne &amp; Wear.</p>

<p>Just think about the advantages, the benefits and the sheer potential of this mode of travel:</p>

<ul>
<li>Light rail is a flexible, adaptable and comfortable way of moving large numbers of passengers along busy route - indeed recent statistics show that passenger journeys in England for light rail and tram systems have increased by 5.5% between 2009/10 and 2010/11 representing the highest number of passenger journeys to date</li>
  <li>It boasts a track record which shows that it is safe, fast and reliable</li>
  <li>And it’s also one of the greenest and cleanest forms of transport - no emissions at source, very little noise and, with the right scheme in the right place, the potential to encourage people out of their cars and on to public transport</li>
</ul>
<p>For me that makes light rail a good news story for passengers, for business and for our environment.</p>

<p>I was also very pleased to see how quickly the teams at Croydon restored services to Tramlink following the disturbances over the summer period.</p>

<p>That is precisely why this government is backing light rail</p>

<h2 id="backing-light-rail">Backing light rail</h2>

<p>Since May 2010 we have supported a number of proposed extensions to existing light rail systems, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>confirmed funding of over £120 million for the Manchester Metrolink extensions to Ashton and to East Didsbury which are currently under construction</li>
  <li>announced our intention to support an extension to Midland Metro through Birmingham city centre to New Street Station</li>
  <li>will hopefully be announcing shortly final approval for the extensions to the Nottingham tram system</li>
</ul>
<p>I also published a report entitled ‘Green Light for Light Rail’, which follows a review undertaken on how we can make light rail more cost effective.</p>

<p>In addition, it explicitly acknowledges the importance of tram-train. Again, I am a big supporter of tram-trains - I really do believe they have a future role to play in our transport system.</p>

<p>The review has considered, amongst other issues, a number of specific areas which I know have been highlighted in the past as a cause of concern. These include</p>

<ul>
<li>utilities</li>
  <li>standardisation</li>
  <li>and planning issues</li>
</ul>
<p>The review has also looked at where and how we can adopt, replicate and spread back practice.</p>

<p>I hope that you have had the opportunity to digest the report and I am anxious to ensure that we all move forward quickly in considering and implementing the recommendations.</p>

<p>And let me briefly highlight some of the key areas where we are asking questions and looking for your help to devise the solutions:</p>

<p>Implementing a new project design for light rail systems - one that’s  uniform across the industry. In this way we can ensure that systems are not over-designed and project budgets are not over-spent</p>

<p>Setting up a ‘centre of procurement excellence’ - an innovation that would enable future promoters to get advice on the best procurement options for their project. Potentially this would make scheme procurement more efficient and less costly</p>

<p>And commencing a consultation inviting views from all the key players and stakeholders about the crucially important relationship between utilities and light rail.</p>

<p>So those are some of the issues and questions facing us. But what is the next step?</p>

<p>Well all of us - government, operators, manufacturers, investors, and constructors - have to make sure that light rail has a bright and progressive future in this country.</p>

<p>And that’s precisely is why I will be chairing a high level ‘tram summit’ of all interested parties in early November to discuss the issues and recommendations in order to develop a sector-led implementation plan for getting light rail on the right track.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing many of you there.</p>

<h2 id="paying-tribute-to-the-nominees">Paying tribute to the nominees</h2>

<p>Now turning to the main event of the evening which I know is a celebration of excellence and achievement.</p>

<p>It’s an opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have led the way, set the pace and made a real difference to the light rail sector.</p>

<p>Just making the awards shortlist is quite an achievement.</p>

<p>But I happen to know that the judging panel has been especially impressed by the sheer quality of this year’s entries.</p>

<p>There are nominees who have developed innovations in everything from customer service to passenger safety.</p>

<p>Others have focused on innovations that can help make light rail even more eco-friendly</p>

<p>Some nominees have worked hard to enhance cross industry partnership and strengthen the supply chain.</p>

<p>And there are even nominees who have developed fresh approaches to campaigning on behalf of the light rail sector.</p>

<p>Individuals and teams, employees and operators, small projects and big projects - all very different but with one thing in common, they have all shown the power and potential of new ways of working and new ways of thinking.</p>

<p>No wonder the judges had to ponder so long and so hard.</p>

<h2 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h2>

<p>Okay - I’ve always believed that less is more - especially when it comes to public speaking.</p>

<p>Indeed, that point of view has been reinforced since I became a minister.</p>

<p>Because that’s when I discovered that Whitehall is the only place on Earth where a 10,000 word document can be described as a ‘brief’.</p>

<p>So, with that in mind, it simply remains for me to thank you for listening and to wish you an enjoyable evening.</p>

<p><strong>(This speech represented existing departmental policy but the words may not have been the same as those used by the Minister.)</strong></p>
