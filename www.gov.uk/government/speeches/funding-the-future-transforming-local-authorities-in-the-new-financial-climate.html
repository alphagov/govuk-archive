<h3 id="transcript">Transcript</h3>

<p>Let me start by saying the obvious: it was a tough settlement. I know councils are facing very difficult choices.</p>

<p>But so is the nation.</p>

<p>Public debt is now approaching nearly a trillion pounds.</p>

<p>Last year, the government was borrowing one pound in every four it spent.</p>

<p>It spent more on interest payments on public debt than on schools.</p>

<p>It was completely unsustainable. It risked our economic credibility and our economic future.</p>

<p>You can’t ignore a quarter of public spending, and councils recognise that they have an important role to play in bringing down public sector debt.</p>

<p>But given the track record that local authorities have - more prudent, more efficient than other parts of the public sector over the past few years - I have every confidence that local authorities will rise to the challenge.</p>

<p>Against that background it is not easy to increase productivity and reduce back office services - without hitting front line services.</p>

<p>Leicestershire and Nottingham, planning to save £2 million a year through sharing their back offices.</p>

<p>West London councils looking to go even further and share front line services.</p>

<p>Bath cutting their top team - so the money can go to the frontline.</p>

<p>Leighton Buzzard saving money thanks to good housekeeping over the past few years - which they can now invest in actually improving some services.</p>

<p>I’m really pleased about the numbers of councils who are coming together to share services and work through these challenges together.</p>

<p>I’m really impressed with the numbers who are biting the bullet on senior pay and sharing chief executives.</p>

<p>And I’m grateful to those who are recognising the importance of transparency - I’m pleased to report that more than 200 councils have now put their spending online.</p>

<p>Now of course, there are some councils who have been out grandstanding in the media.</p>

<p>But if you’ll forgive me, I’m not going to address them today.</p>

<p>Because they aren’t listening.</p>

<p>I am much more interested in working with the majority of you who have stepped up to the plate.</p>

<p>I want to make sure you have everything you need to tackle these challenges head on.</p>

<p>The Localism Bill will make a very big difference.</p>

<p>And I want to thank the NLGN who have worked so constructively with us to shape the best possible deal.</p>

<p>You helped organise a meeting that framed my idea of the operation of the general power of competence - and I hope you will work with us again as we start looking at the repatriation of business rates.</p>

<p>For the first time in decades, councils will have real bite, real powers, a real say over the issues that matter to residents.</p>

<p>All part of a much more radical distribution of power - so community groups and residents have much greater control over their lives.</p>

<p>This is an incredible opportunity for those ambitious, radical councils with a powerful vision for their area. </p>

<p>But there is also a big threat to localism on the horizon.</p>

<p>An issue which fills middle England with rage.</p>

<p>Cuts to bin collections.</p>

<p>If councils can deliver a service that the public like and have confidence in, that’s a matter for them.</p>

<p>But, we need to remember that rubbish is the most visible, most frontline service of all, in return for paying £120 a month in council tax.</p>

<p>If we don’t sort this out, we will set the cause of localism back by a generation, by creating an army of residents who view their council with resentment rather than respect.</p>

<p>There is genuine anger that in the past decade their council tax bills have doubled, but their bin collections have halved.</p>

<p>In the public’s experience, the iron fist of the municipal state has come down on people for the most minor of bin breaches.</p>

<p>State officials - a town hall bin police - rifle through families’ bins without their consent.</p>

<p>Good Samaritans who pick up a fly-tip are admonished for dropping it off at the local dump.</p>

<p>And pensioners face larger fines than shoplifters for the offence of not closing a bin lid.</p>

<p>I could not think of anything more corrosive to destroy trust in local councils than a stealthy imposition of bin cuts, bin fines and bin taxes.</p>

<p>It is naive to think this has been purely a consequence of local discretion. It most certainly has not. All of these bin policies came from central government interventions and interference.</p>

<p>Cooked up in Whitehall, with councils picking up the blame.</p>

<p>With almost no debate in Parliament, the law was changed, weakening the requirement to collect bins, and allowing bin charging.</p>

<p>The Audit Commission marked down councils which refused to go fortnightly, and issued guidance cajoling councils to restrict their service to households, while quangos urged councils to impose fortnightly collections - recommending doing so after local elections to avoid it being a ‘political issue’ and - quote - to overcome ‘public resistance’.</p>

<p>These central policies resulted in perverse local outcomes which need to change.</p>

<p>So we’ve already taken steps to abolish bin taxes.</p>

<p>We are scrapping the Audit Commission’s interfering inspections.</p>

<p>We’ve issued new guidance to stop bin snooping.</p>

<p>And the government’s Waste Review will set out a proper route map.</p>

<p>We intend to work with councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections - starting with removing the perverse incentives that have pushed councils to cut services.</p>

<p>We want to make it easier to go green - championing innovative schemes like Recyclebank which reward recycling.</p>

<p>And we will tackle public concerns over the civil liberty aspects of inappropriate enforcement practices; while clamping down on genuine fly-tipping which blights our lay-bys, our side streets and our countryside.</p>

<p>The local government sector must wake up to the fact that - even with the best of intentions - public policy on bin collections went horribly wrong in recent years.</p>

<p>But if we need to address the issues which threaten localism - we also need to look at those forces which will really give it bite.</p>

<p>In particular, I want to make sure that councils have economic freedom to go with their political independence.</p>

<p>We’ve taken some steps in the right direction.</p>

<p>With a couple of exceptions we’ve ended ringfencing so that councils get their money with no strings attached.</p>

<p>We will also be letting them borrow against future growth in business rates.</p>

<p>But we need more fundamental reform.</p>

<p>So the system is more transparent - not a formula Einstein himself would struggle to understand.</p>

<p>And so we break councils’ financial dependency on central government. Having to come round with the begging bowl, saying ‘please sir, I want some more’ isn’t the mature relationship we need.</p>

<p>The key is letting councils keep much more of their business rates.</p>

<p>In one fell swoop, you make the system more straightforward.</p>

<p>Make councils more self-sufficient.</p>

<p>Give them a genuine financial stake in the local economy - which goes hand in hand with our proposals for local enterprise partnerships.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not without its challenges.</p>

<p>There are important issues we need to work out.</p>

<p>We need to keep protecting the most vulnerable councils, who don’t have a strong tradition of private enterprise. We won’t simply be cutting all councils loose.</p>

<p>And we need to make sure the business community has the certainty and stability it needs.</p>

<p>I want to give councils the green light to become more innovative and work more closely with business - not to rack up the business rates.</p>

<p>But I think with your input, we can sort these issues out sensibly.</p>

<p>We can strike a new balance.</p>

<p>So those councils who can be more self-sufficient, aren’t trapped in a financial straightjacket anymore.</p>

<p>And all councils, whatever their circumstances, are rewarded for promoting growth.</p>

<p>So in the short term, I know that councils have got some tough decisions to make.</p>

<p>But I also feel very optimistic about the long term.</p>

<p>I believe that in a relatively short period, councils will be almost unrecognisable from today.</p>

<p>Much stronger, more dynamic, more powerful.</p>

<p>With political autonomy and financial independence.</p>

<p>And with a much more direct, responsive, relationship to residents.</p>

<p>The most ambitious, the most innovative councils are already heading down that road.</p>

<p>There is a tremendous opportunity for everyone to follow suit.</p>
