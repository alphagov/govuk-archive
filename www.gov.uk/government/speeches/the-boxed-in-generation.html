<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It’s been a busy morning.</p>

<p>They say a week is a long time in politics and it’s a lesson I’ve learnt in recent weeks.</p>

<p>And it’s hard to believe that it’s almost five years since I took on the housing brief, first in opposition and now in Government.</p>

<p>The experience has given me a few insights into this great industry which I thought would be worth sharing today.</p>

<h3 id="the-housing-paradox">The housing paradox</h3>

<p>But, first, let me start with a paradox.</p>

<p>In the last decade we built too few homes, far fewer than needed.</p>

<p>House prices soared but, by 2009, house building had fallen to its lowest level since the 1920s.</p>

<p>The noughties was a decade of, I think, missed opportunities.</p>

<p>It wasn’t as if nobody wanted new homes.</p>

<p>You couldn’t turn the telly on without seeing another house related programme: <em>Changing Rooms</em>, <em>Grand Designs</em>, <em>The Restoration Man</em>.</p>

<p>Yet the housing market had ground to a halt.</p>

<p>And I think the problem was clear. Buyers certainly weren’t to blame. It was the system.</p>

<p>You could see the system at work, or perhaps I should say failing to work, in any one of those TV property programmes.</p>

<p>The red tape your sector had to cut its way through. The endless regulations. The interminable delays.</p>

<p>The energy, enthusiasm, determination - dissipated. Willingness to stake out the new property frontiers - simply frustrated.</p>

<p>It was enough to stir up the inner builder in any of us.</p>

<p>Trouble was, in the past, the centre talked a good game but did very little to change the environment.</p>

<h3 id="building-more-houses">Building more houses</h3>

<p>Now our solution to this housing problem is simple - we’re going to get out there and build more houses. Not talk about it. But actually do it.</p>

<p>We’ve learnt the lessons of the past.</p>

<p>I know Government alone won’t get the market started.</p>

<p>So this will be a team effort.</p>

<p>The NewBuy Guarantee Scheme we’ve just been talking about I think is a case in point.</p>

<p>We’re giving up to 100,000 prospective buyers up to 95 per cent loan to value mortgage to purchase new build properties.</p>

<p>It’s a great idea. And I know you agree. Because you came up with the idea.</p>

<p>Now we’re determined to let you get on with it.</p>

<p>No builders are excluded from NewBuy by design and we won’t intervene in the commercial arrangements of builders and lenders.</p>

<p>With more lenders and builders coming on board, customers will have a wide range of options to choose from when buying their newly-built home.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, in Cambridgeshire, we welcomed the very first buyer to purchase a home through the NewBuy guarantee scheme.</p>

<h3 id="a-boxed-in-generation">A boxed in generation</h3>

<p>Now NewBuy can also help a group of people who’ve often been overlooked.</p>

<p>Traditionally the political debate has focused on the people at the very bottom of the pile and the people at the very top.</p>

<p>But what about those stuck in between?</p>

<p>Those who slip, not so much under the radar, as between it.</p>

<p>Second generation buyers in flats or houses which they have actually grown.</p>

<p>Almost everyone knows someone in that position.</p>

<p>A hardworking person who bought their own home when they were single, maybe met someone, fell in love, and now have a couple of kids.</p>

<p>They expected to trade up.</p>

<p>That’s what every parent would have done after all.</p>

<p>But now they’re boxed in.</p>

<p>Home outgrown.</p>

<p>They don’t have cash to pay for a mortgage three or four times their own salary. Let alone 10 or 20 times.</p>

<p>They face the prospect of being boxed in, in their homes, for up to 25 years or more.</p>

<p>According to HSBC research, of the 360,000 homeowners who bought their first property in 2007, many are trapped in their first home and unable to move up the property ladder.</p>

<p>What does it say about our system that we’ve a generation who feel forgotten?</p>

<p>That nearly a third of parents feel boxed in their homes, unable to live comfortably in a home too small for the needs of their family.</p>

<p>That their children will have moved on before they’ve managed to move out.</p>

<p>We don’t want Britain to be a place of housing have nots.</p>

<p>We want people to have room to grow.</p>

<p>So the NewBuy Guarantee gives second time buyers a second chance.</p>

<p>The boxed in family now gets help.</p>

<p>Help to buy a new build home with the ceiling price set up to a half a million pounds.</p>

<p>So well done.</p>

<p>You’re thinking outside the box.</p>

<p>Rolling back the housing frontier.</p>

<p>And we’re keen to work with the industry in other ways as well.</p>

<p>The lack of sufficient land to build new homes is an enormous drag on housing growth.</p>

<p>So we’re accelerating the release of brownfield Government-owned land to deliver more than 100,000 additional homes.</p>

<h3 id="working-with-local-authorities">Working with local authorities</h3>

<p>And Government isn’t just working with builders but with local authorities.</p>

<p>Our new Homes Bonus incentivises local authorities to increase their housing stock, bringing more houses back into use, and raising the bar for affordable homes.</p>

<p>Second year payments are going out now and we’re starting to see change on the ground.</p>

<p>When they build extra homes, authorities will now get a bonus to take the strain on their services and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Now these changes will make it easier for communities to accept new housing. As will our plans to improve neighbourhood design.</p>

<p>I want to say more on that in a moment.</p>

<h3 id="working-with-communities">Working with communities</h3>

<p>Besides local authorities we’re working with communities.</p>

<p>Neighbourhood Planning and the Community Right to Buy will help communities deliver the development that they need.</p>

<p>Now it’s 30 years on from the introduction of Right to Buy. And council tenants are increasingly able to use that purchsing power again.</p>

<p>With a maximum discount now at £75,000 across the country - quadrupling the potential amount available in London and trebling it elsewhere.</p>

<p>With the proceeds, unlike the initial buy, going to build new homes for affordable rent.</p>

<h3 id="collaboration---the-industry-and-communities">Collaboration - the industry and communities</h3>

<p>But this isn’t just about Government.</p>

<p>About them and us.</p>

<p>It’s about you.</p>

<p>I want to see the house building industry working hand in glove with local communities.</p>

<p>I know you feel frustrated waiting for the planning green light.</p>

<p>Shovels poised.</p>

<p>Diggers at the ready.</p>

<p>Weeks slowly turning into months.</p>

<p>So we’re helping remedy this situation by providing you with a 12 month planning decision guarantee.</p>

<p>I know this is something you’ll welcome.</p>

<p>But in return there’s something you can do to help us.</p>

<p>You see part of the trouble is local communities sometimes see the plan at the last minute.</p>

<p>It takes them time to get their heads round what’s proposed.</p>

<p>So, in the National Planning Policy Framework, we’re requiring you to consult earlier.</p>

<p>And we’re asking you to think about design.</p>

<p>Now Britain is great at building.</p>

<p>Just a short walk from here is the magnificent Derby House designed by Robert Adam. One of many examples of Britain’s fantastic building heritage.</p>

<p>But if we want great neighbourhoods as well as great buildings we need great designs in order to take our communities with them.</p>

<p>Down in Devon they’ve got the right idea.</p>

<p>Local Totnes residents opposed the developer’s original proposal for a mixed-use residential development on the edge of town.</p>

<p>But working together the council, residents and the local architect devised a fitting alternative.</p>

<p>The door to planning permission was flung open, houses delivered and in hot demand from local buyers.</p>

<p>The lesson is absolutely clear. Great design helps communities accept your work and speed up the system.</p>

<p>Later this year, I’ll be setting out plans to give communities a greater voice and encourage joint working at a Government/Industry Design Summit.</p>

<p>I hope many of you will be involved.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>So I’ve given you a flavour of what we’re doing together to build more homes.</p>

<p>We’re already turning things around.</p>

<p>Since 2009 starts are up by 24 per cent.</p>

<p>New housing output is up by 33 per cent.</p>

<p>And new orders up by 35 per cent.</p>

<p>We’re unfreezing the system. But we need you to go even further, faster.</p>

<p>To work with communities to design sustainable local schemes.</p>

<p>To react speedily when freed up land becomes available.</p>

<p>To tell us what else we can do to help, to rip away that red tape.</p>

<p>To usher in a new age of housing.</p>

<p>An age of magnificent homes to match our ambition.</p>

<p>An age that gives a boxed in community, a boxed in generation, finally room to grow once again.</p>
