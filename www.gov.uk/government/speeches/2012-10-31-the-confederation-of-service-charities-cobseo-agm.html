<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I have been the Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans for little over two months now and it is an honour to be able to fulfil this role.</p>

<p>My portfolio covers issues like: </p>

<p>Making sure that we do what we can to strengthen the backbone of our Armed Forces - the forces families who support them; </p>

<p>Making sure our wounded get the best care we can provide;</p>

<p>Making sure that the hidden wounds of war are treated too with the new emphasis on mental health;</p>

<p>Helping Service personnel succeed in civilian life when they leave;</p>

<p>And making sure that we continue to honour the service of our community of veterans, who make up around 1 in 10 of our adult population.</p>

<p>Are you seeing a pattern here?</p>

<p>My concerns are basically your concerns.</p>

<p>Nobody knows better than you, the life changing work that your organisations do on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I do not need any convincing of the value of COBSEO members.</p>

<p>Delivering services; sharing the burden; helping to meet our collective obligations under the Armed Forces Covenant.</p>

<p>So I want to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you do.</p>

<p>You complement the work of the MOD in a huge number of areas.</p>

<p>I certainly view the relationship as symbiotic. </p>

<p>We are partners, very definitely not rivals.</p>

<h2 id="importance-of-cobseo">Importance of COBSEO</h2>

<p>COBSEO is central to making this partnership work.</p>

<p>We are lucky in Britain to have such a wide range of dedicated Service charities helping those who have given so much to their country.</p>

<p>There are some who question the very existence of service charities.</p>

<p>Shouldn’t this all be done by Government?</p>

<p>What else do we pay our taxes for?</p>

<p>Of course the MOD does directly fund a lot of the work that COBSEO organisations help with, but for me, it just isn’t an either or.</p>

<p>Charity is a good thing!</p>

<p>We should never allow the cynics, or those who seem to believe that making a contribution to society should be exclusively for the public sector, we should never allow them to devalue what is achieved by organisations like COBSEO.</p>

<p>Mr Chairman, the State claims no monopoly on good will.</p>

<p>Take the Big Lottery Fund which is providing £35m for veterans projects like the Forces in Mind Trust run in partnership with COBSEO.</p>

<p>Society is stronger and healthier for the contribution that charities make.</p>

<p>Each of you has your own niche - representing special groups and possessing your own expertise.</p>

<p>That diversity is a massive strength.</p>

<p>But it also makes it difficult for the MOD to be in constant touch with all the work that is going on out there.</p>

<p>So when it comes to establishing a proper dialogue, COBSEO provides an effective and powerful, unified voice.</p>

<p>The MOD is approached by hundreds of charities a year. </p>

<p>We need to know that all of those charities are legitimate, well run and sustainable before we engage with them. </p>

<p>COBSEO membership is useful because it gives us an additional degree of confidence in a charity.</p>

<p>But COBSEO is not the only way charities can represent themselves to the MOD.</p>

<p>From the embedded charity staff in personnel recovery centres, to the close working relationships between military Welfare Officers and a wide range of charities - there are thousands of interactions between the MOD and COBSEO members at grass roots level.</p>

<p>But at the strategic level COBSEO is an important channel of communication and advice.</p>

<p>Charities are often well placed to pick up on the concerns of the groups that they serve.</p>

<p>I understand that in his earlier address the Chairman raised concerns about the future status of the Independent Medical Expert Group (IMEG) which has been subject to review. </p>

<p>I am pleased to announce today, that following discussions with the Cabinet Office, Ministers there have agreed that the IMEG will now be established permanently as an Advisory Non-Departmental Public Body in order that it can continue to provide independent expert medical advice on matters relating to the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme.</p>

<p>We are keen to hear what you have to say. </p>

<p>And that is why COBSEO is an influential member of the Armed Forces Covenant Reference Group - the CRG.</p>

<p>This body helps to steer the direction of the Armed Forces Covenant, which recognises society’s moral obligation to our Service men and women. </p>

<p>You have always understood this moral obligation and been at the forefront of meeting it.</p>

<p>It makes sense, then, that you help us to identify where disadvantage exists and where special provision is needed.</p>

<p>So when the Chancellor announced that money from fines levied on banks involved in Libor rate fixing would be spent on the Armed Forces Covenant, it was only right that this £35 million would be allocated in partnership with the CRG.</p>

<p>This money will go towards supporting the Armed Forces community, including through Service charities, funding work that will address some of the disadvantages that the Armed Forces community face.</p>

<h2 id="the-armed-forces-covenant">The Armed Forces Covenant</h2>

<p>The Armed Forces Covenant is being implemented by many sections of society: by national and local government, by local communities and, of course, by charities.</p>

<p>But some of these efforts can be wasted, if we apply our resources to the wrong areas.</p>

<p>And this is another area where your advice is so effective.</p>

<p>Thanks to your help the Covenant is starting to make a real difference.</p>

<p>Just over a year ago we launched the Community Covenant Scheme, encouraging local authorities to meet the unique requirements of the Service personnel and their families living in their jurisdictions. </p>

<p>We are now in a position where Community Covenant Partnerships have been signed by over 200 local authorities, up and down the UK, with more on the way.</p>

<p>For instance in my own patch in Essex, the County Council will sign the Community Covenant next week in the run up to Remembrance.</p>

<p>These partnerships have enabled local authorities to understand the needs of Service families and introduce practical measures to improve their access to GPs, dentists, local schools and housing. </p>

<p>The Community Covenant Scheme is backed by a separate £30m Grant Scheme. </p>

<p>Around £5m has already been released to support local projects that benefit veterans, serving personnel and the communities they live in.</p>

<p>We have also re-launched the Defence Discount Service, helping to recognise the contribution of our Armed Forces by providing them and their families with financial savings.</p>

<p>And there are many other initiatives at national and local level which help make the Covenant a reality.</p>

<p>At the heart of the Covenant is getting society to understand how much it owes the Armed Forces - past and present - and the families that have supported them - and to encourage society to find ways of repaying that debt. </p>

<p>We need you to continue helping deliver the Covenant, but we also need you to help judge the progress of that delivery.</p>

<p>The charities’ commentary on the Secretary of State’s Annual Report on the Covenant is one of its most important sections. </p>

<p>It holds us to account and it gives us guidance on how we might improve in the future.</p>

<p>The publication of this first annual report, which is not far away now, will show progress.</p>

<p>But this is only a beginning.</p>

<p>In this job I am absolutely determined to put flesh on the bones of the Covenant to give it real form.</p>

<p>And to use it to improve the lives of service personnel and their families.</p>

<p>There is still much to do.</p>

<p>But I hope that when you see the report you will feel that we have made a good start.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I know that you too have been discussing your future today. </p>

<p>I have been told that this AGM represents something of a crossroads for COBSEO and its members as you decide your long term direction.</p>

<p>It is right that these are decisions for you to make.</p>

<p>Let me just say though that I have been impressed with how much impact COBSEO has made with limited resources.</p>

<p>We value the coherence it gives to Service charities and the validating role it has with regards to its members.</p>

<p>Both of these are functions that you might like to consider taking forward and developing in partnership with the MOD.</p>

<p>We certainly don’t want you to lose your individual identities as charities.  They define you and they focus you.</p>

<p>But the confederation of charities that COBSEO represents, works very well from our perspective.</p>

<p>Whatever decisions you make, I look forward to continuing the extremely productive relationship that we have forged.</p>

<p>Thank you and Good Luck.</p>
