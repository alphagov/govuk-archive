    <title>Christmas holiday travel advice</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A few simple preparations before and during your holiday can help to make your Christmas trip safe and trouble free.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do get into problems while abroad then we are here to help, but you can avoid a lot of difficulties in the first place by following these basic tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/staying-safe/travel-insurance/" title="Travel insurance"&gt;take out comprehensive travel insurance&lt;/a&gt; - make sure it covers you for any activities you are likely to undertake such as extreme or water sports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;check our &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/" title="Travel advice by country"&gt;Travel Advice for the country you are visiting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;check &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nathnac.org/" title="NaTHNaC"&gt;The National Travel Health Network and Centre’s website&lt;/a&gt;T or contact your GP’s surgery as early as possible before you travel to find out if you need any vaccinations or other medication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for certain countries your passport must be valid for six months after the date you travel - check the entry requirements section of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/" title="Travel advice by country"&gt;Travel Advice for the country you are visiting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take enough money for your trip and some back-up funds in a mix of cash and cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-pack-explore-a-new-guide-for-travellers" title="Plan. Pack. Explore. – a new guide for travellers"&gt;download our Plan. Pack. Explore. app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="winter-sports"&gt;Winter sports&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New research reveals that a third of people taking their first winter sports holiday risk serious injury because they are not sufficiently in shape when they hit the slopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research also reveals that two out of five winter sports enthusiasts have injured themselves at least once, highlighting the importance of getting in shape and warming up properly before skiing or snowboarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="visiting-friends-or-family-abroad"&gt;Visiting friends or family abroad?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You still need to take the same preparations as if you were going on holiday. Our research shows that nearly half of young people did not take out insurance the last time they stayed with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>This week at the Foreign Office </title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A look at the work of the Foreign Office and its embassies overseas this week. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h4 id="syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary outlined the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-remarks-at-the-friends-of-syria-meeting" title="Foreign Secretary remarks at Friends of the Syrian People meeting"&gt;immediate priorities for the Friends of the Syrian People&lt;/a&gt; at the meeting in Marrakesh this week. He said “Syria needs a political transition leading to an inclusive new government, with full executive authority. This is the course most likely to achieve stability in the country.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="international-human-rights-day"&gt;International Human Rights Day&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On International Human Rights Day Baroness Warsi launched the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-minister-baroness-warsi-marks-human-rights-day" title="Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi marks Human Rights Day"&gt;UK’s campaign for election to the Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt;. She said: “We believe in a Human Rights Council that can make its voice heard, even when the issues are unpopular or difficult to hear.” The Foreign Office marked &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/" title="16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence"&gt;16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence&lt;/a&gt; ending on Monday with a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/post/37632415718/helen-pankhurst" title="guest post"&gt;guest post from Dr. Helen Pankhurst&lt;/a&gt; from CARE international. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="foreign-office-website-moves-to-govuk"&gt;Foreign Office website moves to GOV.UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-website-moves-to-gov-uk" title="Foreign Office website moves to GOV.UK"&gt;Foreign Office began publishing its news&lt;/a&gt;, speeches, policy, publications and corporate information on GOV.UK – the single home for all government services and information. Our travel advice and consular information, and our Embassy and High Commission websites will follow by March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea-dprk"&gt;Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-condemns-dprk-s-satellite-launch" title="Foreign Secretary condemns DPRK’s satellite launch"&gt;condemned the DPRK’s satellite launch&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday saying that the launch was a clear violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 because it involved the testing of ballistic missile technology. The Permanent Under Secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/north-korean-ambassador-summoned-to-foreign-and-commonwealth-office" title="DPRK Ambassador summoned"&gt;summoned the DPRK’s Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; in London to the Foreign Office to make clear to the UK’s condemnation of the DPRK’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="parental-child-abduction"&gt;Parental Child Abduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New figures revealed that the number of parental child abduction cases dealt with by the Foreign Office has risen by 88% in under a decade. The child abduction section at the Foreign office launched a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/parental-child-abduction-is-a-worldwide-problem" title="Parental Child Abduction"&gt;campaign to increase understanding of the issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-met-the-king-of-jordan" title="The Foreign Secretary met the King of Jordan"&gt;the Foreign Secretary met His Majesty King Abdullah of Jordan&lt;/a&gt; they discussed the situation in Syria, the Middle East Peace Process and institute reforms in Jordan that would bring about greater political participation, transparency and economic opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said that the Iranian investigation into the death of the blogger Sattar Beheshti whilst in custody had &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/iranian-investigation-into-detained-blogger-is-missed-opportunity-for-justice" title="Iranian investigation is missed opportunity for justice"&gt;failed to deliver justice&lt;/a&gt;. The Minister said: “The bruises on his body – which the authorities have abjectly failed to explain – are almost certainly a result of mistreatment and brutality that he – like so many others – suffered in detention.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="also-this-week"&gt;Also this week&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington set out the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-for-europe-renews-uk-commitment-to-eu-enlargement" title="UK’s commitment to EU enlargement"&gt;UK’s commitment to EU enlargement to all countries of the Western Balkans, Iceland and Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Parental Child Abduction is a worldwide problem</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New figures reveal that the number of parental child abduction cases dealt with by the Foreign Office has risen by 88% in under a decade.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last year alone the Foreign Office’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/when-things-go-wrong/child-abduction/" title="International parental child abduction"&gt;Child Abduction Section&lt;/a&gt; fielded an average of four calls per day to its specialist advice line, more than half of which were new cases .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-worldwide-problem"&gt;A worldwide problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parental child abduction – where a parent takes a child without the permission of those with parental responsibility – is now a worldwide issue. In 2003/04 we worked on cases in 51 countries; now cases relate to 84 different countries, showing just how widespread the problem has become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also fear that these statistics are just the tip of the iceberg; many cases go unreported as parents seek custody of their children through foreign courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="raising-awareness"&gt;Raising awareness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public understanding of parental child abduction is alarmingly low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research we commissioned shows that half the UK population believes the government can intervene to order the return of a child to the UK if he or she has been abducted by a parent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that whilst help is available, parental child abduction cases can take years to resolve. This has significant impact on those concerned and there is the strong possibility that the child may never be returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also much harder to return a child from a country that has not signed the 1980 Hague Convention, an international agreement between certain countries which aims to ensure the return of a child who has been abducted by a parent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="legal-and-financial-reality"&gt;Legal and financial reality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite parental child abduction being against the law, a quarter (24%) of people do not think, or are unaware, that it’s a crime for a parent to take their child overseas without the consent of others with parental responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked which parent they thought was more likely to abduct a child, three quarters (74%) of people thought it was fathers. Yet according to statistics from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.reunite.org/" title="reunite"&gt;Reunite International Child Abduction Centre&lt;/a&gt;, 70% of the charity’s cases concern mothers taking the child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as this emotional distress, both parents may often face severe financial difficulties as they fight for custody of their child through foreign courts. The statistics show that people tend to underestimate just how much getting a child back costs, including legal fees overseas and in the UK which may continue to mount up even after  the child is returned to this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also seems to be a lack of awareness about who pays the costs of resolving a parental child abduction case involving a non-Hague country. Sixty-two per cent either didn’t know or responded with the wrong answer, and only 38% answered correctly by saying it was the parents who would pay, not the UK Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-expert-view"&gt;The expert view&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daisy Organ, head of the Foreign Offfice Child Abduction Section said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The increase in parental child abduction cases is a major cause for concern, particularly in the lead up to the school holidays; we know that before or during school holidays is one of the most common times for a child to be abducted. We hope that this campaign will help inform and educate the UK public and encourage parents thinking of abducting their child to think twice before they cause significant distress to themselves and their family. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison Shalaby, Chief Executive of Reunite, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is important to remember that parental child abduction is not faith or country specific. 71% of the UK public thought that parents most commonly abduct their children to the Middle East, India and Pakistan but it can happen to anyone, from any background. Countries where children are abducted to can range from Australia, to France, to Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have seen a 20% increase in calls made to our helpline in the first half of 2012 compared to 2011  and a 67% increase in the number of children who have been abducted by a parent to a non-Hague country between 2001 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This issue is not going away and with a 47% increase in the number of child abduction cases Reunite has worked on between 2001 and 2011, we are urging parents to think twice before they abduct their child or seek help if they think their child is at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="contact-information"&gt;Contact information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned, or if your child has been abducted, you can call the FCO’s Child Abduction Section on 0207 008 0878 or visit &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/when-things-go-wrong/child-abduction/" title="Child Abduction Section"&gt;http://www.fco.gov.uk/childabduction&lt;/a&gt;, or Reunite on 0116 2556 234.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Skiers: avoid injury and expensive medical bills</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>We urge winter sports holidaymakers to know their limits before hitting the slopes.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are launching a campaign aimed at Britons visiting European winter sports resorts this winter to explain the dangers of attempting slopes beyond your level of ability, or going off piste without the correct safety equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re heading off a ski or snowboarding holiday this winter, please don’t put yourself at risk by trying to keep up with more experienced members of your party. The number of reported accidents on French slopes in 2012 was high, including seven deaths out of 12 serious incidents*. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="research"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to new research from the FCO**, of those British nationals that go on winter sports holidays the majority class themselves as beginner or intermediate. Only 1% of respondents classed themselves as expert. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly two thirds (65%) of winter sports travellers admitted they would ski or snowboard on slopes above their experience in order to stay with a group. More than half (53%) also said they would follow a group of mates off piste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seventy per cent admitted they do not always wear a helmet when skiing or snowboarding, and one in five (21%) said they wouldn’t wear a helmet if others in their group weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Taylor, Consul, based in Marseille, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last year we saw a high number of British nationals end up in hospital with serious injuries. Sadly this included a number of deaths. Many of these accidents can be prevented by taking simple precautionary steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t make the mistake of assuming you’ll be fine if you’re with more experienced skiers or snowboarders. It is significant that a large number of cases we have dealt with have involved off piste skiing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those lucky enough to survive an accident and end up in hospital can face months of recovery, so it is important to think carefully beforehand about the very real risks out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="insurance"&gt;Insurance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a third (38%) of winter sports holidaymakers admitted that they don’t always take out travel insurance. One in three (31%) also said they don’t always check their policy to ensure they are covered for winter sports activities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Taylor continued:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many people will be unaware that failing to wear a helmet or skiing off piste can invalidate some insurance policies, so if something does go wrong you could end up with hefty medical bills. In many cases family members then have to help with funds which can put a huge strain on families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The FCO cannot pay for hospital treatment or for medical repatriation back to the UK, which is why it is so important to check your insurance covers you for everything you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="top-tips-to-stay-safe-on-the-slopes"&gt;Top tips to stay safe on the slopes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take out insurance – and check what it covers. It might not cover off piste skiing unless you are with a qualified guide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a check-up before you ski - one of the major causes of hospitalisation and death on the slopes is heart attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t drink and ski. Alcohol can affect you more quickly at high altitudes and dangerously limits your awareness of risk and cold.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most skiing injuries are caused by collisions with other skiers – watch your speed and distance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t attempt slopes you’re not experienced or fit enough to tackle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to go off piste, go with a qualified guide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If going off piste carry a shovel, a probe and a transceiver in case of an avalanche. Also remember that you need proper training on how to use a transceiver.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are going out on a glacier, you must wear a harness. If you fall into a crevasse, this will help the rescue team get you out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure someone knows where you’re going and tell them of any changes to your plans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only go off piste skiing or climbing with someone you have met previously and can trust. You need to know his/her capabilities, what you’ll be doing and where.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Figures taken from FCO 2011/12 consular assistance data &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Survey conducted by ICM. Total sample size was 2,023 UK adults aged 18 and over. Fieldwork was undertaken in November 2012. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all UK adults aged 18 and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister for Africa highlights risk of kidnap to British nationals in Sahel region</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Minister for Africa, Mark Simmonds, met members of the travel industry today to explain and emphasise the FCO’s travel advice on the Sahel region to British nationals, including the high risk of kidnap in certain areas of the Sahel and North Africa.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Simmonds detailed how the kidnap threat to western travellers in Mali and some neighbouring areas had grown as a result of instability in the region.  He reinforced how seriously the British Government takes the threat to British nationals overseas. Foreign Office officials asked the industry to highlight the risks and consider alternative options where travellers can still find adventure, but be safe too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Simmonds said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The British government takes the threat to British nationals overseas extremely seriously.  We urge tour operators, including rally organisers, to work with us to make sure that British nationals are fully aware of the serious risks involved in travelling to these areas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The terrorist groups Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M) and the splinter group, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, pose the greatest kidnap threat. Since the recent coup in Mali, both groups have increased their operational reach and have proven capability to travel long distances to kidnap victims.  They have also been known to use criminal gangs to conduct attacks and pass hostages to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Attacks have taken place in Mali, Niger, Mauritania and Algeria. We also assess that they have operational reach into the north of Burkina Faso and southern Libya and I am sorry to say that the situation is likely to still get worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Travel advice for Lebanon updated</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Travel advice for Lebanon has been reviewed and reissued with a change to the overall level of advice. We advise against all but essential travel to the whole of Lebanon.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 19 October 2012 a car bomb exploded in the Achrafieh district of Beirut resulting in eight fatalities and a large number of casualties. British Nationals in Beirut are advised to exercise extreme caution and stay indoors. You should keep yourself informed of developments by keeping abreast of local security advice, media reports and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/middle-east-north-africa/lebanon/"&gt;travel advice for Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous roads throughout Lebanon, including the airport highway, are currently subject to closure with groups of protesters burning tyres.?  There have also been reports of gunfire and sporadic violence breaking out across the country and there is potential for an upsurge in violence.?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We advise against all travel to Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon due to the risks of insecurity, and we advise against all travel to the city of Tripoli. During the week of 20 August 2012, 15 people were reported killed in fighting. Further clashes are possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary launches new FCO Crisis Centre</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The new Crisis Centre has been created to ensure the Foreign Office continues to provide one of the most complete and advanced consular services in the world.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During early 2011, the Foreign Office experienced a series of international incidents that required a crisis response, including the earthquake in New Zealand, tsunami in Japan and the events of the Arab Spring.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the evacuation of British Nationals from Libya last year, the Foreign Secretary launched a review to learn lessons from this period and refine the approach to crisis management. Following the launch of the new Crisis Centre, the Foreign Office is now better equipped to cope with the significant demands that such events place on it, and offer the best possible service to British nationals in trouble overseas. Read the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=Speech&amp;amp;id=823028282"&gt;Foreign Secretary’s speech at the launch of the Crisis Centre&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the launch, the Foreign Secretary said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With this new Crisis Centre, for the first time we will be able handle two large scale events simultaneously; operating a centralised command structure, bringing different departments from across Government into a single place, with the right technology available, so that we can help those in trouble overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The launch of the Crisis Centre today is another step in a cycle of continuous improvement in the way that we deliver our services to the British public. With increasing numbers of British nationals living, working and travelling abroad, and to a more and more diverse range of places, we need to ensure that we are innovative and make the most of emerging tools of communication, such as Twitter and Facebook, so that we can reach and help as many people as possible in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the last year alone, these new approaches and our new capacity has been tested no fewer than thirteen times, including evacuating our diplomats and their families from Tehran, helping those involved in the sinking of the Costa Concordia and dealing with the coach crash in France earlier this year. They are proving to be flexible and resilient. I hope that we can continue to improve the services and support that we provide, supporting the public when they need us and moving towards our objective of becoming the best diplomatic service in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary speaks at launch of new Crisis Centre</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Foreign Secretary William Hague has spoken at the opening of the of the new Foreign Office Crisis Centre in London.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gives me great pleasure to be able to join you here today for the opening of our new Crisis Centre here at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to start by paying tribute to the work of the Crisis Management Department and our whole Consular Team. They work tirelessly, day in and day out, in the evening and at weekends, to make sure that when Britons are in trouble overseas, their safety and security remains our central priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Foreign Secretary, my objective is to strengthen the Foreign Office as an institution; striving to achieve excellence in every area of our work. We have launched the biggest drive to enhance cutting edge abilities and diplomatic skills that this Department has ever seen. We are re-opening the language school next year, and spending £1 million pounds more each year teaching languages to our staff. It is why we are strengthening our diplomatic network and, at a time when many countries are closing posts we are opening new Embassies and Consulates around the world and the launch of the new Crisis Centre is another example of that constant drive to be the best at what we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that most members of the public come into contact with the Foreign Office is through our consular service. These services really matter to members of the public, who find themselves in difficult and unfamiliar circumstances. That is why we have made the provision of modern and efficient consular services to British nationals around the world one of the FCO’s three central objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also why we are trying to make sure that the consular service that we provide is constantly evolving, even if that evolution comes from crisis and sometimes even tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago, on the 10th anniversary of the bombings in Bali, the families and relatives of the victims of that terrible crime, met at the memorial outside the Foreign Office to remember those who were injured and lost their lives. That horrific tragedy led to the creation of our Rapid Deployment Teams; trained volunteers who are prepared to deploy anywhere in the world at a moment’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last ten years they have been deployed more than 50 times to support our staff at post; helping locate missing people, printing emergency travel documents and providing a safe route home for hundreds of nationals who have found themselves caught up in events beyond their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year our staff, both here in the UK as well as overseas have done their utmost to help those in trouble. For example, they worked painstakingly alongside local authorities to identify the seven Britons who were amongst those killed in the plane crash in Kathmandu.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They made sure that when a fire broke out on a cruise ship in Germany with 106 British nationals on board, that the injured were visited in hospital and emergency passports were issued so that everyone could travel home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when 22 British and Commonwealth nationals were trapped by civil unrest in Tajikistan we worked with other European missions to organise an international convoy to make the difficult 15-hour road journey to safety and ensure that everyone was successfully evacuated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of many examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening of the crisis centre here today is indicative of the effort and drive that we put into ensuring that we have one of the most complete and advanced consular services in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By their very nature crises are unpredictable events. Last year the Foreign Office experienced a perfect storm of international incidents that required a crisis response. The earthquake in New Zealand, Tsunami in Japan and the events of the Arab Spring all occurred within three months of each other and all of the consequences took place at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these events have been described as once in a lifetime. None of these events were predictable. All involved large numbers of British nationals and all presented their own unique issues and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges, however, provided us with an invaluable opportunity to learn the necessary lessons and refine our approach in crisis management, so that in the future, we are better able to cope with the huge demands that such events place on the Foreign Office, and offer the best possible service to British nationals in trouble overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the evacuation of our nationals from Libya I launched a review of our evacuation procedures to make a thorough and objective assessment of what had gone well and what we could do to further improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that review there were two main areas in which we felt we could strengthen our crisis response. The first was in procedures and preparedness and the second was in resource and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On procedures and preparedness we have adopted a crisis response system used by the emergency services that offers more agile and clearer decision making in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also raised our game on training, running 13 live exercises over the past 12 months at some of our most high risk posts. Set alongside the launch of new guidance for handling a crisis and better support for our diplomatic posts on how to handle a crisis, we are better prepared for when the unexpected happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On resource and capacity, we have created a new Rapid Deployment Team for the Middle East and South Asia and now have more than 170 trained volunteers who we can deploy, across the globe, to deal with any unfolding crisis. We have increased the number of staff in the Foreign Office dedicated to crisis work from 16 to 26 and have increased the capacity of the crisis centre more than 50% to 110 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new Crisis Centre, for the first time we will be able handle two large scale events simultaneously; operating a centralised command structure, bringing different departments from across Government into a single place, with the right technology available, so that we can help those in trouble overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Crisis Centre today is another step in a cycle of continuous improvement in the way that we deliver services to the British public. With increasing numbers of British nationals living, working and travelling abroad, and to a more and more diverse range of places, we’ve got to ensure that we are innovative and make the most of emerging tools of communication, such as Twitter and Facebook, so that we can reach and help as many people as possible in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year alone, these new approaches and our new capacity has been tested no fewer than thirteen times, including evacuating our diplomats and their families from Tehran, helping those involved in the sinking of the Costa Concordia and dealing with the coach crash in France earlier this year. They are proving to be flexible and resilient procedures so far. I hope that we can continue to improve the services and support that we provide, supporting the public when they need us and moving towards our objective of becoming the best diplomatic service in the world.  &lt;/p&gt;
