    <title>Small businesses to benefit from £1.1 million innovation boost</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation is vital for business growth. The aim is simple – to accelerate economic growth by stimulating and supporting business-led innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A £2 million fund has been created for the Innovation Vouchers scheme, running over the next three years. The vouchers provide £5000 for a UK start-up, micro, small or medium-sized businesses to work with external experts and gain new knowledge to help their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra £1.1 million announced today is for companies who want to use public open data to commercialise their ideas and develop products and prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open data business innovator or inventors could use an Innovation Voucher by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow ing services and solutions using open data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developing an idea into a working prototype&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrating open data with other data sources to develop products and prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seeking Intellectual Property advice in respect of ideas incorporating open data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheme is already open to businesses who want to develop ideas relating to the Agri-food, Built Environment, Space industries, Energy, Water and Waste sectors, with a hundred vouchers allocated every three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest figures from round one show that over 200 projects were successful in the draw for Innovation Vouchers for Agri-Food, Built Environment and Space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the announcement, Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This new wave of Innovation Vouchers will give SMEs a great opportunity to bid for funding that can make a real difference to the growth of their business ideas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They will be able to develop exciting proposals that can make use of open data, which have the potential to unlock great value and boost economic growth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="innovation-vouchers"&gt;Innovation Vouchers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will be able to apply for the Innovation Vouchers directly through the &lt;a rel="external" href="https://vouchers.innovateuk.org/"&gt;Technology Strategy Board&lt;/a&gt; and the Open Data Institute (ODI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business can use their Innovation Vouchers to work with knowledge suppliers such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universities and further education colleges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research and technology organisations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical consultancies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catapult centres&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design advisers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intellectual property advisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional funding for open data vouchers comes after BIS announced this week new measures &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/New-funding-to-accelerate-benefits-of-open-data-684c1.aspx"&gt;to open up access to public data&lt;/a&gt;, including a new £7.5 million Data Strategy Board Breakthrough Fund and a new £850,000 open data Immersion Programme which will assist public organisations and companies in opening up new opportunities for data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vince Cable promotes UK advanced manufacturing</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;8 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="mira-technology-park"&gt;MIRA Technology Park&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIRA Technology Park (MTP) was granted &lt;a rel="external" href="http://enterprisezones.communities.gov.uk/"&gt;Enterprise Zone&lt;/a&gt; status by the government in August 2011. This has enabled MIRA to become Europe’s most advance independent transport technology facility. It is the first milestone in MIRA’s aim to become Europe’s most advance independent transport technology facility. Vince Cable opened the Technology Park’s new £6 million Control Centre, with the help of a MIRA unmanned vehicle to cut the ribbon.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIRA provides state-of-the-art secure research facilities where high-tech companies can develop products that will make the world’s vehicles cleaner, smarter and safer. With companies like Bosch, Ashok Leyland, Triumph Motorcycles, Norgren and Lockheed Martin, the MTP cluster will help the UK to benefit from advanced automotive manufacturing, through deep rooted research and development.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was created the Technology Park has created 188 jobs, and a further 145 will be created in 2013. These are steps towards the goal of creating 2,000 jobs at MIRA over the next 10 years, and will contribute to the growth of advanced manufacturing in the Midlands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="funding-for-low-carbon-automotive-research-and-development-challenge"&gt;Funding for low carbon automotive research and development challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Business Secretary also announced £16.5m of funding for the next low carbon automotive research and development challenge from the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), the Office of Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). This will support R&amp;amp;D into four key areas: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;internal combustion engines &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;energy storage and management &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lightweight vehicle and powertrain structures, and &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;electric machines and power electronics. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="toyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day at Toyota in Burnaston, Vince Cable witnessed the launch of production of the new Auris model - this time in all its hybrid, petrol and diesel guises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Business Secretary acknowledged Toyota’s critical part in the success story of the UK automotive manufacturing industry. Toyota has &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made the technology to reduce carbon dioxide from cars a mainstream proposition, as the first company to manufacture a volume hybrid vehicle in Europe &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;boosted UK automotive manufacturing by investing in Burnaston, including £185 million in Auris for its European markets. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable met Toyota workers who were initially recruited as temporary contractors and were then offered production apprenticeships. Toyota now offers all new production workers a Level 2 apprenticeship. A high percentage have taken up this apprenticeship offer, with some going on to become direct Toyota employees. This supports the government’s aim to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Aug/holt-review-new-measures-to-improve-apprenticeships-for-smes"&gt;promote apprenticeships and make them more widely available&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="regional-growth-funding-for-derby"&gt;Regional Growth Funding for Derby&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable also confirmed that Derby City Council will receive £40 million for its programme bid under Round 2 of the Regional Growth Fund (RGF), supporting growth and sustainable employment in the area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Programme will provide funds to support local business investment. This is expected to create around 3,000 new private sector jobs in the area in 2020, and develop local transport infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
