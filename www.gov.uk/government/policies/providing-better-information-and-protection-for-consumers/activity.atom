    <title>Press Release: Know your shopper's rights before you hit the winter sales</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Boxing Day sales begin and January sales loom, Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson is urging consumers to shop responsibly and be aware of their rights to a refund or exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent figures show that more shoppers are choosing to buy their festive treats online, but with internet shopping and many other methods of buying, it can be difficult for consumers to know exactly what the rules are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jo Swinson said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The festive period is the one time we happily push away scrooge-like thoughts and shop for gifts for our loved ones or to take advantage of the wide range of sales. We are increasingly being spoilt for choice with a wide range of goods, services and shops to choose from, but the variety of choice can mean that consumers forget to take note of the different shoppers’ rights that apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would urge consumers to take note of when they are entitled to a refund or exchange, and to bear in mind any restrictions on certain purchases. When shoppers do buy something, and later change their mind or have a problem with the purchase, I want them to be aware of their rights and obligations to make sure they can get their money back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The current laws that apply to buying goods and services need to be clearer, as do the rules on shopping online or buying digital content. The proposed Consumer Bill of Rights aims to clarify and modernise the law, ensuring consumers are confident about their rights across all areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="general-rules"&gt;General rules&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a consumer buys goods, they must be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, last a reasonable time and match any description given. If they don’t the consumer can usually get either a repair, replacement, refund or partial refund. The consumer has the right to any claim for 6 years from purchase, or 5 years in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to be aware that sometimes these rights won’t apply. For example if a consumer just changes their mind they will not have the same rights unless the shop they bought from offers them under its own store policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="return-deadlines"&gt;Return deadlines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers have a “reasonable time”, often around 4 weeks (although it may be less, depending on the goods in question), to return faulty goods and get a full refund. After this, they may only be entitled to an exchange or partial refund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="faulty-goods"&gt;Faulty goods&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If goods are faulty, consumers don’t need to have a receipt to return the item, just proof of purchase. However they may not be entitled to a refund if the fault is due to normal wear and tear, or if the consumer damages the item themselves. This will also be the case where the consumer was aware of the fault before they bought the item. If a consumer keeps the goods for too long before telling the shop or trying to fix the problem themselves, they might not be entitled to get all of their money back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="sale-items"&gt;Sale items&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers have the same rights for sale items as they do for full price items. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="gifts"&gt;Gifts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most shops offer gift receipts, legally only the person who paid has a right to return faulty goods.  To avoid any hassle it’s best to use gift receipts where available, or get the trader to write ‘‘this is a gift for —’’ on any receipt or invoice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="dangerous-or-unsafe-goods"&gt;Dangerous or unsafe goods&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an item is suspected to be dangerous or unsafe, the individual should stop using it immediately. Dangerous or unsafe goods should be reported to Trading Standards on 08454 04 05 06.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="private-purchases"&gt;Private purchases&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a shopper buys directly from a private seller, they cannot get their money back if the goods are not satisfactory or fit for purpose. They do however have the right to get their money back if the item doesn’t match the description, e.g. if the seller says the item works and it doesn’t. Consumers should always ask for a receipt and contact details from sellers where they can, and keep copies of any relevant adverts or website pages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="online-auction-sites"&gt;Online auction sites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general shopper’s rights apply when buying from a seller who makes some or all of their income from selling through online auction sites. If the seller is just an occasional private seller, the more limited rules of private purchases apply. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="online-mail-order-and-telephone-shopping"&gt;Online, mail order and telephone shopping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers who opt for these buying methods have extra rights in addition to the general rights. If they buy a service they can cancel their order up to 7 working days after making it, and if they buy goods they can cancel 7 working days after receiving the item. Consumers can claim a refund if they don’t receive their item within 30 days. However, consumers can’t return certain goods that they have changed their mind about, including opened CDs or DVDs, food, personalised goods, newspapers and magazines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When buying online consumers should be able to see certain information about the seller, the goods, and the seller’s terms and conditions on the seller’s website. To see exactly what information required visit Citizen’s Advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="future-proposals"&gt;Future proposals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, BIS consulted on proposals for a new Consumer Bill of Rights, which will set out a clear code of shopping rights with workable remedies when things go wrong.  It will empower consumers, making it easier for them to understand their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify the nature of consumers’ rights and remedies in relation to the supply of goods, which is currently an area where the law is unnecessarily complex.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bring the services regime more in line with the regime for goods, by strengthening consumer rights and remedies in relation to faulty services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modernise the law on digital content to protect consumers, by establishing a clear digital content regime with its own tailored set of rights and associated remedies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There will also be one clear set of rules governing public investigations of breaches of consumer law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Bill of Rights consultation closed in October, and the government will respond in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is seeking views on the possible repeal of the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 (PMA). The PMA makes it an offence to make false or misleading statements in the course of an estate agency or property development business about property offered for sale. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs) provide similar protections for consumers. This duplication may be unnecessary; putting additional burdens on business, without providing additional protection for consumers. The consultation considers whether the Government should repeal the PMA, now that the CPRs are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Better choices: better deals. Report on progress on the consumer empowerment strategy</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>This report covers the progress that has been made in the 18 months since the consumer enpowerment strategy was launched. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer empowerment strategy Better Choices: Better Deals was published in April 2011. This progress report describes how the wide range of commitments made then have been taken forward. Many of these have involved two or more of government, businesses, economic regulators, consumer groups and individual consumers coming together to develop practical ways to help empower people to make better choices and get better deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The empowerment strategy established midata, a programme of work involving government, consumer groups and leading businesses to give consumers more control and access to the data that companies hold about them. The aim of the midata programme is to give consumers access to their transaction data in a way that is electronic, portable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Buying Smarter Together</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Better shopping deals for the consumer gets a boost as the winner of the UK Buy Better Together Challenge is announced.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;28 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Smarterbuys’ scheme, which helps provide affordable loans to disadvantaged people so that they can buy essential goods, has scooped the £15,000 Buy Better Together Challenge prize, presented by Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Challenge was launched by BIS and Co-operatives UK in December 2011 to encourage groups of consumers to get together and negotiate discounted rates for buying goods and services in bulk. The Challenge received 110 entries, which were whittled down by a panel of independent judges to seven finalists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Fair Food Carlisle’ was awarded the runner-up prize for their scheme which uses buying groups to provide workplaces with a weekly supply of food from local businesses, winning £5,000 which will be invested in improving business processes and hiring staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event Jo Swinson said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;” The Buy Better Together Challenge has highlighted hundreds of fantastic ideas and examples from local communities, who banded together to make their money work harder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Collective purchasing is of immense value to groups, not just to make cost savings, but to increase social links in the community and reach out to vulnerable consumers who may not have access to online research or internet shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The schemes we have heard about today aren’t just benefitting consumers though; businesses have seen first-hand how they can gain more customers by working with these groups and communities, often beating competitors in the process. Many congratulations are due to the organisers of ‘Smarterbuys’, which is a positive example of how collective purchasing can challenge existing markets and provide better results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And I also congratulate ‘Fair Food Carlisle’ in supporting local produce growers and taking an innovative approach to boosting their local food economy. These schemes are a clear example of what can be done when consumers are empowered and work together to get better deals.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New power to boost consumers access to data</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Jo Swinson announces new powers for consumers to request their personal customer data from business, under the midata programme.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;19 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers will be given new powers to request their personal customer data from business, helping them manage their money better and make better lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Aug/next-steps-making-midata-a-reality"&gt;consultation this summer&lt;/a&gt;, the Government will announce that it will look to legislate if companies fail to comply with the voluntary release of consumers’ electronic data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/midata-review-and-consultation?cat=closedwithresponse"&gt;Read the government’s response to the consultation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under new plans, companies would have to release data they hold relating to a consumer’s consumption or transactions in an electronic machine readable format, upon request. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with the power to legislate will be focussed on three ‘core’ sectors: current accounts and credit cards, mobile phones and energy, with further powers to extend the legislation to other sectors if appropriate.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment and Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“‘midata’ is all about putting power into the hands of consumers. Many businesses reap huge commercial benefits from the information they gather from consumers’ daily spending patterns. Why shouldn’t consumers also benefit from this by having access to their own data to enable them to make better choices?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s great when your energy provider tells you how much gas or electricity you’re using at any point in the year or when phone companies tell you which one of their tariffs suits you best. But it’s even better when consumers can use that information to get better value for money deals or adjust their lifestyles.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is just one of many ways ‘midata’ can help, as businesses increasingly recognise sharing data as a means to deliver a better service for their customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
