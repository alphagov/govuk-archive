Examines the factors that contribute to the decision-making process of high achievers, and uses these to frame the admissions experiences of those who applied to the most selective HE and those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Inspiring the Future launches</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 Jul 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new scheme to send an army of volunteers into state schools to give inspirational talks about their careers has been launched by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deputy Prime Minister was joined by an array of famous faces and people with interesting jobs who are backing the plan, including entrepreneur Karren Brady, actor Joanna Lumley, Glamour magazine editor Jo Elvin, radio presenter Margherita Taylor and head chef at The Ivy restaurant Gary Lee.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone remembers the person who inspired them to follow their chosen career, but independent schools have much stronger links with businesses than schools in the state sector. Research published today by the Education and Employers Taskforce, an independent charity, shows that 80 per cent of independent schools regularly bring external speakers into their schools to boost the career aspirations of their students. 85 per cent involve employers in giving careers advice to students, through Careers Fairs or regular careers talks. Many state schools lack the alumni links to give their students the same opportunities. The ‘Inspiring the Future’ initiative, run by the Education and Employers Taskforce, will play a key role in plugging this gap by connecting inspiring speakers with local schools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="link"&gt;Link&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>Reforms to Higher Education sector announced</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;11 Jun 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans to put students at the heart of the system were announced by Ministers today, as they set out their response to the Higher Education White Paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/g/12-890-government-response-students-and-regulatory-framework-higher-education"&gt;Government response to ‘Students at the heart of the system’ and ‘A new regulatory framework for the HE sector’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red-tape barring some smaller specialist institutions from being awarded the title of ‘university’ will be ditched. Previously, institutions needed 4,000 students to become a university, but from today this limit will drop to 1,000 - sweeping away an arbitrary piece of regulation that was preventing excellent institutions using the title. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change will come into effect immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be a review into how existing quality assurance arrangements affect alternative providers, including further education colleges offering higher education. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Widening participation statistics released</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//analysis/statistics/higher-education/official-statistics-releases/widening-participation-in-higher-education/analysis-of-progression-rates-for-young-people-in-england-by-free-school-meal-receipt"&gt;Widening Participation in Higher Education: Analysis of progression rates for young people in England by free school meal receipt and school type&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New statistics show that a greater proportion of students receiving free school meal went on to university between 2005/06 and 2008/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap between the progression rates of those receiving and not receiving free school meals was 18 per cent in 2008/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the statistics, Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These figures show how far we have to go to ensure that young people with the ability to go onto Higher Education have the opportunity to do so. While the progress to widen participation at our universities is welcome, more progress is needed - particularly at the most selective institutions. That is why we have expected universities to put more ambitious outreach programmes in place for 2012 - and they will be reviewed annually for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our reforms ensure there are no financial barriers in the way of bright young people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds attending university. There are no upfront fees, more financial support while studying, as well as a more generous package of scholarships and fee waivers.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These statistics are being published as part of the social mobility strategy, Opening Doors, Breaking Down Barriers (April 2011), and replace the previous Full-Time Young Participation by Socio-Economic Class (FYPSEC) measure.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Next stage of the HE consultation opens</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIS has launched a consultation on details of the regulatory system for the future of higher education today, following publication of the higher education white paper.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent White Paper Higher Education: Students at the Heart of the System (June 2011) set out a commitment to introduce a new, fit-for-purpose regulatory framework to establish the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) as lead regulator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new consultation launched today is a technical consultation, and to be read alongside the White Paper. It informs what changes in procedures, powers and duties will need to be considered, particularly in forthcoming legislation, in order to protect the student interest and provide a high quality experience.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/hereform/technical-consultation/"&gt;Take part in the consultation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Access agreements for universities</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office for Fair Access (OFFA) has today announced it has approved 2012-13 Access Agreements for 139 institutions - 123 higher education institutions and 16 further education colleges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also announced that English universities and colleges charging above £6,000 for their courses plan to boost their spending on access measures to £602 million a year by 2015-16, up from £407 million in 2011-12. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This figure rises to £738 million a year when the Government’s contribution to the National Scholarship Programme (NSP) is included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.offa.org.uk/press-releases/universities-and-colleges-to-increase-their-spending-on-access-to-600-million-a-year/"&gt;Read OFFA’s announcement in full.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Government is determined that no-one with the ambition and ability, whatever their background, should face barriers to accessing higher education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Progress over the past few years in securing fair access to the most selective universities has been inadequate. Only around 40 pupils out of the 80,000 on free school meals currently make it to Oxbridge at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The government therefore tasked OFFA with setting more demanding tests than in previous years. We are satisfied that universities and colleges are showing their determination to improve. Indeed, by 2015, we expect the sector’s investment in access to be more than £600m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will be monitoring performance on fair access closely every year to ensure we see tangible progress in opening the doors of our universities to the most disadvantaged.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universities and Science Minister David Willetts went on to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We told universities to be much more ambitious with their plans for attracting people from low income backgrounds in exchange for charging students more. This will result in a step change in social mobility with university investment in programmes such as summer schools, scholarships and fee waivers reaching more than £600 million annually by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The majority of students will not be paying £9,000. No one should be put off going to university for financial reasons. No first time undergraduate will have to pay up front costs and there is a very generous package of financial support. Graduates will make lower monthly repayments than they do now.”&lt;/p&gt;
