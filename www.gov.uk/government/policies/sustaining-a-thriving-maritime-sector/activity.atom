&lt;p&gt;Help for shipping lines, their agents and ports to complete statistical returns on maritime freight traffic through ports, as required by the European Commission Maritime Statistics Directive (95/64/EU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-rules-and-code-lists/"&gt;administrative rules and code lists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-submission-methods/"&gt;submission methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-faqs/"&gt;frequently asked questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-maritime-statistics-directive"&gt;What is the Maritime Statistics Directive?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maritime Statistics Directive is a piece of European Union legislation passed in December 1995 &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;amp;lg=EN&amp;amp;numdoc=31995L0064"&gt;Council Directive 96/64/EC&lt;/a&gt; which requires Member States to supply to the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) information relating to maritime traffic through its’ ports. The UK has been required to report data under the Directive since 1 January 2000. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:141:0029:0047:EN:PDF"&gt;directive was ‘recast’&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, bringing together the original directive and various subsequent amendments in one document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="is-the-provision-of-data-obligatory"&gt;Is the provision of data obligatory?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. The directive requires the government to make collection obligatory in the United Kingdom. The legal powers in the UK are by means of a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/2330/contents/made"&gt;statutory instrument&lt;/a&gt; under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. The statutory instrument (number 2330 of 1997) obliges all relevant bodies in the transport industry to provide data to &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; for onward transmission to Eurostat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-has-to-provide-the-data"&gt;Who has to provide the data?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the statutory instrument requires all relevant transport organisations to provide the data, the detailed data has to be provided by the shipping lines or their agents for freight movements through major UK ports (i.e. those handling more than one million tonnes of freight per annum). In addition, port authorities at major ports have to provide quarterly aggregated data to confirm the completeness of the data collected from shipping lines/agents.
At minor ports (those handling less than 1 million tonnes) only annual aggregate figures are required from port authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-are-the-data-collected"&gt;Why are the data collected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collected under the directive are used by the European Commission to assist in policy development at a European level and to monitor the impact of European policy measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the UK government has collected statistics on port traffic in the UK since longer before the Directive came in. These have been used by government, business and the wider public in developing and debating maritime transport policy and in planning operations and new ventures. The effect of the Directive was to change the detail of what was already collected in the UK and introduce much more consistency in European port statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-is-responsible-for-ensuring-collection-of-data-in-the-uk"&gt;Who is responsible for ensuring collection of data in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government department with overall responsibility for the data collection is the Department for Transport, (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;). It employs a collection agent, BMT Reliability consultants, to carry out the day-to-day operation of the data collection activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="where-can-i-find-the-results-from-the-data-collected"&gt;Where can I find the results from the data collected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport publishes UK data. Eurostat publishes &lt;a rel="external" href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home"&gt;Europe-wide data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-data-has-to-be-collected-and-how-often"&gt;What data has to be collected and how often?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Directive requires the collection of statistics on freight traffic, vessels and passenger traffic through ports throughout the European Union. The &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; has the means to collect data on vessels and passenger traffic separately, so the system described here relates to the requirements for freight traffic only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data relating to freight traffic is only being collected in detail for UK ports handling more than one million tonnes of freight per annum (‘major ports’). This detailed data includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reporting port;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Lloyds Register Number (or IMO Number) for the vessel (or name, flag and deadweight);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the direction of movement (inwards or outwards);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;port of loading for inwards cargo or unloading for outwards cargo;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for unitised traffic the type of units (container, accompanied trailer, unaccompanied trailer etc.);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whether they are loaded or empty units;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of units and the freight tonnage;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for other traffic, the broad product group and freight tonnage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data has to be provided at least quarterly and is being collected primarily from shipping lines or their agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the ‘major’ port authorities (where traffic exceeds one million tonnes per annum) are providing the following information on a ‘retrospective’ quarterly basis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the names of all shipping lines and agents using their port;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the identity of all vessels using their port; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the gross weight and number of units of goods in and out of their port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data for other ports, handling less than one million tonnes a year, is being provided only annually in summary form by port authorities. 
For more see &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-rules-and-code-lists/"&gt;administrative rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-are-the-data-collected-in-the-uk"&gt;How are the data collected in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These range of options are available by which data providers can supply the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by sending the data automatically via a Port Community System&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by entering the data through web based forms (iSDES)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by submitting ASCII data files in a &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; approved format&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by completing paper forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection agency provide a central database to collect and store the data received by these methods, ready for transmission to &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details see &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-submission-methods/"&gt;submission methods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-rules-and-code-lists/"&gt;administrative rules&lt;/a&gt;.     &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU Transport Council 29 October 2012</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will attend the first Transport Council of the Cypriot Presidency (the Presidency) in Luxembourg on Monday 29 October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Presidency hopes to achieve general approach on 3 proposals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the allocation of slots, repealing Council Directive 95/93/EC. The proposed regulation has been subject to intense official-level scrutiny by Council Working Groups and these discussions are ongoing. Progress to date has been mixed, but the proposition remains acceptable from a UK perspective. I believe that the resulting regulation could help promote the most effective use of airport slots and build on the existing transparent, market-based approach to encourage the more efficient use of scarce capacity at congested airports, while minimising administrative and financial burdens for industry. However, at this stage, it remains unclear whether or not it will be possible to seek a general approach at the October Council.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second is a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the enforcement of certain provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention by flag states. The proposed general approach represents a satisfactory outcome for the UK and I will support it as it allows appropriate flexibility to member states, and will not require the UK to make any substantive changes to its proposed implementation of the provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention on flag state responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The third is a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2009/16/EC on port state control. I will support the proposal which will not require the UK to make any substantive changes to its proposed implementation of the provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention on port state responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An orientation debate will be held on a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on roadworthiness testing for motor vehicles and their trailers (first reading). The UK strongly supports the ongoing roadworthiness testing of vehicles as a worthwhile contribution to road safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the UK is very concerned by the potential cost burden of the European Commission’s proposal as it is currently framed. The UK alone has identified costs of over €1 billion without any discernable benefit in road safety. We have also identified significant administrative burdens embedded in the proposal that similarly would produce no road safety benefit. In the current economic climate the UK does not wish to see any additional cost to European citizens, businesses or governments unless clearly justified by road safety benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Presidency will be seeking a political agreement on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council (first reading). The UK supports the proposal which strikes a sensible balance between improving the security of the tachograph whilst ensuring that additional burdens on industry and enforcement authorities are minimised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council will be expected to adopt a proposal for a Council decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the agreement providing a general framework for enhanced cooperation between the European Union and the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol). The UK supports the proposed agreement. It is important that the significant work Eurocontrol performs on behalf of the European Union is put on a sound contractual and financial basis to help ensure value for money from the proposed €40 million expenditure over 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Shipping fleet statistics: 2011</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents summary statistics on UK and world shipping fleets, updated annually. Data are generally updated simultaneously with releases in the port freight statistics series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were 730 UK owned trading vessels, totalling 20.5 million gross tons, or 22.5 million deadweight tons. Of these 730 vessels, 162 were tankers, 140 were ro-ro vessels, 114 were container ships and 78 were bulk carriers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;930 trading vessels were UK parent owned, totalling 27.2 million gross tons and 35.2 million deadweight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1,228 trading ships were UK managed, totalling 49.4 million gross tons or 63.8 million deadweight tons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All three of these fleets, as well as the UK Registered fleet, have grown substantially over the previous decade. However, growth has generally levelled off over the last 2-3 years, and the size of the UK parent owned fleet declined after 2008, although it partly recovered in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The world trading fleet at the end of 2011 consisted of over 55,000 vessels, totalling 983 million gross tons, or 1.47 billion tons deadweight.&lt;/li&gt;
