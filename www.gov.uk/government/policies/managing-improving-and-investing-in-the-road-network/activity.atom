    <title>Crucial road improvements to be delivered twice as fast</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorists and hauliers will benefit from increased capacity on England’s motorways by spring 2015 thanks to the acceleration of three upgrades, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will be delivered in this spending review period rather than the next, as the government introduces major improvements to the way road schemes are planned and built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new way of working should in future see lanes added to motorways in up to half the time it normally takes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three schemes being accelerated are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M3 J2 to 4a, Surrey &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;M6 J10a to 13, West Midlands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;M1 J28 to 31, Derbyshire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vital improvements to A160/A180 route to the Port of Immingham will also start construction sooner than originally planned in the summer of 2015 and completed autumn 2016 - cutting 18 months off the original construction timetable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am determined to cut the time it takes to upgrade our roads in half by dismantling procedures that have slowed us down. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Together these schemes will increase capacity for millions of road users by 72 miles. My ambition is that in future all major road schemes will be accelerated, tackling congestion more quickly and boosting the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a keynote speech to the &lt;abbr title="Confederation of British Industry"&gt;CBI&lt;/abbr&gt; yesterday, the PM announced that “it’s our ambition to cut the time it takes to upgrade our roads in half”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport and the Highways Agency has looked hard at how to speed up the decision making process and the time it takes to have roads ready for use by motorists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that 1km of managed motorway (using the hard shoulder as extra lanes and variable speed limits) can be built every two weeks, instead of every four. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is expected more complex, traditional capacity improvements on non motorway routes, such as the A160/A180 Immingham improvements, will be delivered up to 25% quicker/a quarter more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commitment to faster delivery means this government will bring forward £75 million of investment forward into this spending review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) There are four schemes in the programme where this new approach to road upgrades will be piloted, these are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surrey, M3 J2 to 4a managed motorway &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the West Midlands, M6 J10a to 13 managed motorway &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Derbyshire, M1 J28 to 31 managed motorway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A160/A180 Immingham dualling scheme - improving access to the Port of Immingham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Surrey, M3 J2 to 4a managed motorway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on this scheme, which was added to the roads programme last autumn, is expected to start 2013/14 and be completed by spring 2015 rather than during 2016. The start of work is subject to the completion of necessary statutory processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest cost-range estimate for the project is £159 million (minimum) to £223 million (maximum). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is located on 13.4 miles of the M3 Motorway between Junction 12 of the M25 (M3 J2) to the A327 (M3 J4a) in Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra capacity will come through converting the hard shoulder to a traffic lane – with variable speed limits helping to reduce congestion and smooth traffic flows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will provide more reliable journeys from London and Heathrow to Solent Ports – important for both leisure and business commuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) West Midlands, M6 J10a to 13 managed motorway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on this scheme, which was added to the roads programme last autumn is expected to start 2013/14 instead of 2014/15 and be completed by spring 2015 instead of during the next financial year – 2015/16. The start of work is subject to the completion of necessary statutory processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest cost-range estimate for the project is £140 million (minimum) to £201 million (maximum). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is located on a 9.6-mile stretch of the M6 between junctions 10a and 13, to the north west of Birmingham. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra capacity will come through converting the hard shoulder to a traffic lane – with variable speed limits helping to reduce congestion and smooth traffic flows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will support the economic development in and around the M6 by increasing business efficiency and improving reliability for business travellers, freight and logistics operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Derbyshire, M1 J28 to 31 managed motorway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on this scheme, is expected to start 2013/14 and be completed by spring 2015 instead of during the next financial year – 2015/16. The start of work is subject to the completion of necessary statutory processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will add extra capacity on the M1 near Sheffield, between junctions 28 and J31 (18.9 miles), which is the primary strategic link between Nottingham and Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra capacity will come through converting the hard shoulder to a traffic lane – with variable speed limits helping to reduce congestion and smooth traffic flows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity improvement will support the economic development in the 7th and 8th largest urban areas in the United Kingdom by increasing business efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Immingham A160 and A180 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on this scheme is expected to start in summer 2015 instead of during 2016 and complete by autumn 2016 instead of during 2018 - this is subject to the successful completion of statutory processes, and the construction budget being agreed (for the next spending review period).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of an original five-and-a-half year programme, our ambition is to cut 18 months off the completion date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest cost-range estimate for the project is £89 million (minimum) to £132 million (maximum). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are proposing to improve the A160/A180 by upgrading it to a dual carriageway and improve access to the Port of Immingham. The A160 is approximately three miles long and has sections of both single carriageway and dual carriageway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the A160 carries around 13,000 vehicles per day, including approximately 5,700 heavy goods vehicles (44%) with road users experiencing severe congestion at times, particularly along the single carriageway sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Road schemes can be delivered more quickly by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;undertaking concurrent planning, design and construction preparation activities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;taking more work off-site and bringing to site as pre-fabricated/pre-assembled units&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;moving toward a 24 hour operation with more people on site working on multiple phases at once &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Consultation to scrap motor insurance certificates launched</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drivers could benefit from less motor insurance red tape after a government consultation to scrap the legal requirement to issue certificates was launched today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 8 week exercise will seek the views of the industry, motorists and other stakeholders on the benefits of moving towards a purely online system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under current law, insurance companies must issue a paper or electronic certificate when agreeing a policy. However, many organisations, including the police and vehicle rental companies, already rely on information stored on the Motor Insurer’s Database (MID) as evidence of valid insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roads Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More and more people are using technology to organise their everyday lives so it is only right we look at how we can make life easier for motorists and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That is why we are launching a consultation to scrap the legal requirement for insurance certificates to be issued and consolidate a system whereby all information is online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This has the potential to make significant savings down the line which I hope will be passed on to policyholders. It will also make the lives of motorists and police easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits to moving to an online system include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;motorists will no longer be forced to retain certificates as details will be accessible online. This will remove the legal requirement whereby vehicle owners are required to return their certificates to insurance companies in order to cancel the policy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;police and the commercial motor industry would be better able to check details at source, instead of relying on policyholder documents which can be forged. The Police already use a download of the MID to identify uninsured drivers on the road.
If the consultation is successful then the Department would look to repeal the current law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal is part of the government’s Red Tape Challenge, which invited the public and stakeholders to give their views on which regulations should stay, be improved, or be scrapped altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/removal-of-motor-insurance-certificates"&gt;consultation document&lt;/a&gt; is available on the DfT website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the department proposes to amend s147 (1) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 to remove the need for insurers to issue motor insurance certificates (whether issued as a paper document or electronically)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Association of British Insurers (ABI) estimate the cost of producing each certificate is about £1 and around 34.2 million insurance documents are issued per annum.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Campaign to Protect Rural England - Annual Lecture - Transport and the Countryside</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great pleasure to be here with you in this extraordinary museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A place that shows us how transport built London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the world’s first underground trains in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the Routemaster bus in the 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the cablecars and Boris bikes of today.
Transport is what makes London tick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s easy to see why people sometimes think transport only matters to big cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I know – and you know – they’re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="derbyshire-dales"&gt;Derbyshire Dales&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, because I represent the Derbyshire Dales in Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe I’m the first Secretary of State for Transport with a really rural constituency since John MacGregor in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m afraid you are going to hear quite a lot about it today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derbyshire Dales is not just the most beautiful part of the Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the back garden for half the cities in England. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Derby and Nottingham - all just a short trip away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They put huge pressure on our rural transport system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But transport doesn’t just matter for visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a necessary part of country life, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The further you are from towns, services, jobs and friends, the more important transport becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why rural Britain needs good transport just as much as urban Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact it always has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at a map of stagecoach routes for Derbyshire in the eighteenth century and you’ll also be looking at a map of bus and car routes today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s another thing that’s just as evident in rural life today as it was in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take my local branch line from Derby which ends at Matlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 1968, this was a busy mainline from Derby to Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that year, Barbara Castle made the mistake of closing the route between Matlock and Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we regret that closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a century ago, when it was first built, people protested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Headstone Viaduct was built through Monsal Dale, John Ruskin said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The valley is gone! Now every fool in Buxton can be in Bakewell in half an hour. And every fool at Bakewell in Buxton.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, as now, you’ll always find people ready to question whether we need more capacity, or better links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, we did then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we do today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has happened in the intervening years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the fundamental requirements of our economy are exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need better transport to connect people with the workplace and goods with the marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s not enough to close our eyes to the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, Ruskin was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful Monsal Dale not only survived the construction of the line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was enhanced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The viaduct is now a listed structure and the old railway has become the Monsal Trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so popular even I have cycled on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s just the sort of thing I’d like to see more of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you accept that we need good transport to live our lives and expand our economy then two questions come to mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you provide it so that rural people can benefit too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how can you make sure the beauty of Britain doesn’t suffer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t easy questions to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that there are a couple of ways to look at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either you try to freeze progress, put up with what you have got already…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and condemn rural Britain to a nasty mix of stagnation and congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you can be confident, see transport as a good thing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and do what it takes to make sure that transport helps the countryside, not harms it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cars-and-community-transport"&gt;Cars and community transport&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that takes me directly to cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people, cars are rural transport – and dare I say it, that includes many &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt; members too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m not apologetic about supporting drivers, rural garages, rural roads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And rural Post Offices, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With today’s good news that the &lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s new £450 million, seven-year contract will stay with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know that running a vehicle has become more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly in rural regions where people have fewer options and tend to do higher mileages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just the cost of rural driving that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cars have a growing impact on the countryside too. Rural traffic is rising fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s affecting the tranquillity of the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I want people to be free to drive…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…I also want to protect what they come to the countryside to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means ideas like the “quiet lanes” we have in Derbyshire…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and it means making sure there are good alternatives to driving too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of rural people and visitors don’t have access to a car, or don’t want to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have got to help rural bus services, and support alternatives like community transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re keeping the Concessionary Travel Scheme which allows older and disabled people to travel for free on local bus services after the morning peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re developing a new approach to subsidising buses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re putting £600 million into the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve also increased funding to boost community transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community rail, in particular, has been a great success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rural branch lines – the lucky ones that survived Dr Beeching – have shown outstanding growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the St Ives Bay line, just over four miles long…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…to the 88-mile route along the Cumbrian Coast…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…. and my local line through Duffield to Matlock, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="road-signs"&gt;Road signs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So transport plays a fundamental role in the rural economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s something else I want to talk about today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landscape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the countryside looks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many country roads carry a reminder of how insensitive planners can be to aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugly and unnecessary signs clutter up the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New signs seem to sprout like weeds, without any apparent consideration of what’s already there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often what we’re left with is not just a blot on the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s confusing and potentially dangerous too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those ‘temporary’ signs saying “New Road Layout Ahead” that are left to rot for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or near me in Derbyshire there’s an ugly big sign by a beautiful medieval church that just says: “No Footpath”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s on a small country lane. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there isn’t a path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t need a huge sign to tell us that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m determined to do more to sort this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a traffic signs review in 2011, and we’ve relaxed rules that used to insist on two signs by the road side when one would do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re working on revised Traffic Signs Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combined effect of these changes will be to give authorities and designers much greater freedom to simplify and use fewer signs at country junctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to make sure that they use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my message today to highways engineers is: if in doubt, don’t do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save your money for something that really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="road-safety"&gt;Road safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something, for instance, like road safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, around two-thirds of fatal traffic accidents happened on rural roads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re looking at ways to give councils a greater say over speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, creating 40 &lt;abbr title="miles per hour"&gt;mph&lt;/abbr&gt; zones in national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful to the &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt; for responding to the consultation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ll issue guidance by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="hs2-and-the-countryside"&gt;HS2 and the countryside&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve spoken about some of the immediate challenges facing rural transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also my job to prepare our country for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next 30 years, for instance, passenger demand for rail is set to double…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…while vehicle traffic will rise rapidly too, especially outside cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a country, we are travelling more and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet many of our roads and railways are already overcrowded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a railway system conceived in the 19th century straining to support a 21st century economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I want to get cracking on High Speed Two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just to get faster journeys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to free up space on the rest of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get freight onto rail, and trucks off our roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know it’s controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people here today will oppose the line strongly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I respect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also want you to hear the case for going ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My argument today is that we need good transport and more of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question is how we provide it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think HS2 is the right way to do it for our countryside as well as our cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High speed, high capacity stations in city centres will encourage new housing and business on brownfield sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means fewer big new roads through the countryside and less urban and suburban sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt;’s vision for 2026 makes clear, the sustainable cities will preserve and energise rural England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put it another way: a better Manchester and a better Sheffield can also mean a better Peak District.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our objective with HS2 is not just to make sure it isn’t just the south-east that benefits from growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also to deliver it in the most responsible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, what’s good for the economy and what’s good for the environment have been seen as polar opposites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s assumed you have to make a straight choice between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also an attitude that favours division over dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I reject that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I welcome the &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt;’s constructive – but challenging – input to High Speed Two. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start, we have sought to consider the views of rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their evidence was carefully weighed up after one of the largest public consultations ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a result, we announced alterations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than half the route between London and Birmingham will now be in tunnels or cuttings…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Including a longer, continuous tunnel under the Chilterns from Little Missenden to the M25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 13 miles through the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty, less than 2 miles will be at or above the surface. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means less impact on ancient woodlands and heritage sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is still a lot to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So HS2 Ltd will keep working hard with you and others as the scheme develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we consult on the best route for HS2 north of Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="design-and-compensation"&gt;Design and compensation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m particularly keen to ensure high quality design for structures along the route &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ones that are sensitive to the character of their setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can confirm today that I have asked HS2 Ltd to look at establishing an independent HS2 Design Panel – just as we did for the Olympic Park and Crossrail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made up of experts in architecture, engineering, town planning and transport, it will work with local people, councils, environmental and countryside groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than that, those whose homes are affected will be recompensed over and above what the law requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those living closest to HS2 will be able to sell their home to the government – whether they are required for construction or not – at any time after the route is safeguarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will receive its full value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they will also receive a 10% additional home loss compensation up to a value of £47,000.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’ll be reimbursed for reasonable moving costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rural areas we will establish a voluntary purchase zone which will go out as far as 120 million from the railway line, within which homeowners will have the option to sell their properties to the government for the full value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there will be a long term hardship scheme to help those further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also believe that the impacts of HS2 will be considerably less than many fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we expect property values to recover over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example of HS1 in Kent suggests this is more than a hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fear-of-change"&gt;Fear of change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings me back to something I mentioned at the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear of change in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows what would have happened to our green belt over the decades had the countryside lobby not protested and made its voice heard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we have moved on from the days when Swampy was headline news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve learnt from massive advances in green technologies and construction techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve learnt that it’s neither environmentally or morally acceptable to build new infrastructure without careful consideration of the surrounding landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve learnt that offering either an effective transport system or a clean and green environment is a false choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those road protests were against schemes designed more than a quarter of century ago, by a generation of road builders whose careers began when the very first motorways were being created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re investing around £2 billion in a programme of fourteen managed motorways schemes across the country &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than hugely expensive widening programmes, we’re making the most of our existing infrastructure through use of the hard shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with HS2, projects have to fit into the existing landscape, matching the topography, where necessary using false cuttings and planting new trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use quieter tarmac, and noise barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We build boxes for bats and tunnels for badgers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we sometimes build entire substitute habitats for protected species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of how much progress has been made is the A3 Hindhead Improvement scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opened last year, this project not only protects the surrounding countryside – but makes it much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tunnel was built to bypass the village of Hindhead and remove a notorious traffic bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the scheme also reunited two commons previously split by the road, creating the largest area of lowland heath in Southern Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers also planted 200,000 trees and shrubs to provide a magnificent haven for wildlife and lovers of our countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that isn’t a one-off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when we improved the A30 in Cornwall we bought land with Natural England to create new moorland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a 670 hectare wetland nature reserve – the largest of its kind in Europe – is being created on Wallasea Island…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…from almost 5 million tonnes of earth excavated from beneath London as part of the Crossrail project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schemes like these are not isolated examples of good practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re a pointer to the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt; – and the broader environmental lobby – can certainly take credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know you’ve got an even bigger role to play in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not proposing to emulate China, which over the next three years will build 70 new airports…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and ten massive new transport routes crisscrossing one of the largest countries in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we do have to modernise key parts of our transport system if the UK is going to be able to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what HS2 will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new transport network for the 21st century that will meet rigorous environmental standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. A final thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t just oppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider what’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And work with us to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Removal of motor insurance certificates</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on amending the Road Traffic Act 1988 to remove the need for insurers to issue a motor insurance certificate when an insurance policy is taken out. At present the certificate is used as evidence of valid insurance cover and there are circumstances when it must be produced by the insured to demonstrate they have valid cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurers are required by law to enter details of all motor insurance policies onto the motor insurance database (&lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt;). This consultation document considers using the &lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt; as the single source for checking if insurance cover is in place and considers what further changes and developments are needed to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency 13 November 2012</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt;) has recently run a competition to procure a front office counter service provider for its face to face motoring services from next April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can today announce that &lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt; will award Post Office Ltd® a contract to build on the existing counter operation to provide a wider range of services and better accessibility for motorists. The contract will run for 7 years with an option to extend for up to another 3 years. This contract will allow the Post Office to fully develop better services with the requirements of customers at the heart. Under the contract Post Office Ltd® will offer &lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt; services at over 4,700 outlets for road tax and vehicle transactions, 750 of which will also cater for driver licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new contract provides value for money for the taxpayer resulting in savings of between £13 million and £15 million a year. The contract also gives scope for the Post Office to provide front office counter services for other government departments, to increase efficiencies across government and provide better value for the tax payer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Evesham to benefit from new £8.2 million bridge</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work to replace the Abbey Bridge over the River Avon in Evesham can now start after the proposals received final approval from Local Transport Minister Norman Baker today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bridge and viaduct need to be replaced as they are in poor condition and the current structures are already subject to a 7.5 tonne weight restriction. If the structures are not replaced then even lower restrictions would be needed in the near future along with the possibility of full closure to all traffic soon after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When completed, the new bridge will allow the current weight limit to be removed bringing the bridge up to current national standards and allowing it to be used by HGVs, coaches and buses. The replacement bridge will improve access to Evesham town centre from the south for local residents and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excellent scheme will restore the full capacity of this important route and provide a boost to the local economy by ensuring that access to the town centre for bus passengers and lorries is maintained. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The £5.6 million we are putting into this project shows that the Coalition Government is serious about investing in the infrastructure the country needs to drive economic growth both locally and nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Abbey Bridge replacement scheme was one of the schemes given funding approval last year as part of the Spending Review process.  Work can now start on construction with the new bridge scheduled to open in December 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today’s announcement grants Full (final) Approval to the Abbey Bridge replacement scheme enabling work to begin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The scheme, promoted Worcestershire County Council, is scheduled to open in December 2013. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Department will provide a maximum of £5.59 million towards the full scheme cost of £8.2 million.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Consultations launched for Dartford free-flow</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two consultations in support of a project to improve traffic flow and ease congestion at the Dartford - Thurrock River Crossing are being launched on Monday. Both consultations will lay the legal foundations for changes to how road user charges will be collected and enforced under a free-flow operation at Dartford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free-flow technology will allow motorists to use the Dartford Crossing without having to stop at barriers to hand over payment. It will allow the remote collection of payment through a variety of methods including telephone, text message, online, and at retail outlets – giving motorists greater flexibility in how and when they pay the charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two consultations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ‘Charging Scheme Order’ is being led by the Highways Agency and is a chance for local residents, authorities, businesses and emergency services to comment on proposals to give drivers options to pay the charge after they have used the Crossing, and the proposed enforcement measures that would be used under free-flow when it comes into effect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ‘Enforcement Regulations’ is being run by the Department for Transport and is aimed at possible charging authorities which would include local authorities and the Highways Agency. It aims to &lt;a href="/government/consultations/road-user-charging-scheme-regulations"&gt;collect views on how road user charges should be enforced&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of free-flow being introduced at Dartford.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free-flow charging is part of a package of planned improvements being carried out by the Government to improve motorists’ experiences in using the Dartford Crossing. Discounts will remain in place for those that set up an account and pay in advance and for those that qualify for the Local Residents’ Discount Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roads Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By removing the barriers at the crossing congestion will be reduced and traffic flow will improve for all motorists – but that means the way payment is collected will change.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We need to make sure we have steps in place to allow enforcement against drivers who do not pay their road user charge. How and what will happen needs to be decided and that is exactly what the Enforcement Regulations consultation will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigel Gray, Highways Agency senior project manager, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Dartford Crossing is a crucial piece of national infrastructure that brings economic benefits to the region and the whole country. We understand how frustrated motorists are and that is why tackling congestion here is an absolute priority.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The draft order sets out how the charge at Dartford will operate and how we propose to enforce it under a free-flow charging arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road users will be encouraged to pay the charge in advance of their use of the crossing. Proposals detailed in the Charging Scheme Order consultation set out the charges that will apply, and will allow road users to pay at the standard rate up to midnight on the day of using the crossing or at the standard charge plus 20% on the following day. After this the proposed penalty charge for non-payment would be £70, with a reduced rate of £35 if paid within 14 days. If the penalty is not paid within 28 days it is proposed that it would increase to £105.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A statutory public notice has been published by the Highways Agency in the technical and local press ahead of the ‘Charging Scheme Order’ consultation opening on Monday. Consultees have until Monday 28 January 2013 to make their comments. Both consultations will be available from Monday 5 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Charging Scheme Order can be viewed on the consultation page of the Highways Agency’s website, and at Dartford Borough Council and Thurrock Council offices. The Enforcement Regulations consultation will be available on the Department for Transport’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Highways Agency is an executive agency of the Department for Transport. We manage, maintain and improve England’s motorways and other strategic roads on behalf of the Secretary of State.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Dartford – Thurrock River crossing is a vital transport link over the lower Thames estuary to the east of London. Comprising of two tunnels (each carrying two lanes northbound) and a four lane cable stayed bridge for southbound traffic, it is one of the busiest transport gateways in the country, carrying around 150,000 vehicles every day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tackling congestion at the Crossing is a priority for the Government.  Improvements include suspending the charges during periods of heavy congestion following an incident, introducing free-flow charging to tackle congestion and improve journey times at the Crossing, and continuing work on analysing the options for a new Lower Thames crossing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The introduction of free-flow charging at Dartford is being progressed to the following timescale:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summer 2012, start procurement process for customer charging and enforcement management services contract (underway)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Autumn 2012, start public consultation on secondary legislation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Winter 2012/13, invite tenders for customer charging and enforcement management services contract&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Summer 2013, Statutory Instrument laid before parliament&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Autumn 2013, contract award of customer charging and enforcement management services &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Summer 2014, technical go-live, controlled testing and integration&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Autumn 2014, full operation of free-flow charging at Dartford&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A statutory public notice regarding consultation for the draft new Charging Scheme Order that would support free flow charging was published today (1 November) in the London Gazette and Dartford Messenger and will be published in tomorrow’s Thurrock Gazette (Friday 2 November)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Statutory consultees, as well as other public bodies, organisations or businesses, and members of the public are invited to comment on the plans, which are specifically related to the Dartford Crossing, and set out how the charge will be collected, and how it will be enforced under a free-flow charging arrangement. The consultation will run for 12 weeks, until 28 January 2013.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neither consultation asks consultees to comment on the Dartford road user charge rates.  DfT consulted in 2011 on proposals to revise the road user charge at the Dartford Crossing, and published their response to this consultation in May 2012. No further changes to the road user charge rates at the Dartford Crossing are proposed for the new Charging Scheme Order or the Enforcement Regulations.&lt;/li&gt;
