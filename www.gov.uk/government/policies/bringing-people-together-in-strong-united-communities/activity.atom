    <title>Communities ministers wish the Jewish community a happy Chanukah</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to take this opportunity to recognise the huge contribution the Jewish community has made, and continues to make, towards British society and culture. We have seen some marvellous examples of this throughout the year such as Barnet and District Synagogue joining a food collection with their local church as part of ‘A Year of Service’. The annual triumph of ‘Mitzvah Day’ has also seen thousands of people across the globe volunteer - from improving the local environment, working with the homeless or visiting care homes - these activities have all made a real difference to their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I saw this first hand when I recently attended a multi-faith volunteering event organised by a local synagogue in St Albans. It was terrific to see how so many people gave their time to help the wider community, and come together with those of other faiths at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d like to wish the whole Jewish community a very happy Chanukah.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith Minister Baroness Warsi said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As each candle is lit over the next eight nights during the Festival of Lights, I want to wish all Jewish communities a very happy and peaceful Chanukah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The lighting of the menorah candles remind us of the persistence of hope and endurance through difficult times and I want to acknowledge the role that the Jewish community play within our wider society. I work closely with many Jewish groups in my role as Minister for Faith and Communities and particularly enjoyed visiting a ‘Mitzvah Mummies’ event - a volunteering project where mothers and their babies visited residential care homes - earlier this month. It was wonderful to see the joy this brought the residents and it showed how faith can bring people together and have such a positive impact on the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Happy holidays to you all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Winners announced for faith-based photography competition</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This annual competition uses photographs to celebrate how faith is present in communities throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A panel of judges, headed by award-winning photographer Don McCullin, chose the winning photographs from 3 categories which were: moments of faith, community spirit against the odds and A Year of Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Year of Service, supported by the department, was a new category included in the competition this year. It aims to celebrate social action and to mark the practical contribution that faith groups make within their neighbourhoods to improve the lives of those around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each faith in turn has hosted a day, or days, of volunteering throughout the year and those taking part were encouraged to send in photos that captured the inter-faith volunteering projects they had been involved in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They say a picture is worth a thousand words and I was delighted to see A Year of Service really come alive in some terrific photos that perfectly captured the strength of our faith communities and the commitment they make to their neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This has been a memorable year of social action so thank you to all the budding photographers who entered and congratulations to the winners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith Minister Baroness Warsi said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These photos really illustrate what can be achieved when communities join together, so it was fantastic to see all of the photographs that were submitted for the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank you to all those who took part, it is great to have a permanent record of A Year of Service events - here’s to another successful year of faith volunteering and social action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winning photograph for A Year of Service was entitled ‘There but for the Grace of God’ and was taken to coincide with the theme of giving during the Harvest Festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A man giving food to a homeless woman" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1245/grace_of_god_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;'There but for the Grace of God'. Picture: Rob Boler&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This photograph and the other winners and finalists in the competition can be found on the awards and highlights section of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ftal.staged.ws/awards-highlights-from-2012/"&gt;Faith Through a Lens website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baroness Warsi was speaking at the Coin Street Neighbourhood centre where she gave a key note address at Together in Service, a national celebration for A Year of Service. The event, organised by the department was opened by Communities Minister Don Foster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees including faith leaders and representatives of faith-based organisations, were also invited to contribute to a piece of art work which will be donated to the Evelina Children’s Hospital, a part of Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Painting of children planting a peace garden" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1246/art_work_picture.JPG"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Baroness Warsi with the painting to be donated to Evelina Children’s Hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scene includes 9 children planting a peace garden - each of the children representing 9 different faith groups. Attendees of the celebration were invited to create flowers which are included in the garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photos of the Together in Service event are available from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/communitiesuk/sets/72157632131148440/"&gt;DCLG Flickr channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lancashire flag flying high above Whitehall</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flag features the iconic red rose of Lancaster, which is the county flower of Lancashire, on a background of golden yellow - the livery colours of the county. The red rose is a symbol for the House of Lancaster, immortalised in the verse “In the battle for England’s head/York was white, Lancaster red” referring to the 15th century War of the Roses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historic county of Lancashire dates from the 12th century and emerged during the industrial revolution as a major commercial and industrial region. The county encompassed several hundred mill towns and collieries. By the 1830s, approximately 85% of all cotton manufactured worldwide was processed in Lancashire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Eric Pickles holding the flag of Lancashire with two Lancashire MPs" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1207/lancashire_flag.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Eric Pickles is joined by Lancashire MPs Eric Ollerenshaw OBE and Mark Menzies&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 2 years flags for all the English counties have been flown outside the department, to celebrate the important place counties play in the nation’s cultural heritage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of other flags has also been hoisted above the building to recognise national days of significance such as the Red Ensign flag for Merchant Navy day, the Armed Forces flag for Armed Forces Day and the flag of the Falkland Islands to mark the islands’ liberation day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has also published a new, ‘&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flying-flags-a-plain-english-guide"&gt;Plain English guide to flying flags&lt;/a&gt;’. This will make it easier than ever before for individuals, businesses and community groups to fly their chosen flag without incurring costs of up to £335.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide provides a clear summary of the new liberalisation of controls over flag flying that were recently introduced by the Secretary of State. It is a simple way of knowing which flags can be flown without the consent of the local planning authority so that communities can continue to fly them with joy and pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“England’s counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been celebrating this patriotic pride by flying a range of flags outside my department over the past couple of years. The new plain English guide will make it easier than ever to do this, so I look forward to seeing more flags flying around the country with the relaxation of these rules.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Dawson from the Friends of Real Lancashire said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Successive governments have confirmed the boundaries of Lancashire, and we welcome their further confirmation by this government, which demonstrates the valuable part that traditional counties play in modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the flying of traditional county flags outside the department’s office will lead to further measures to promote the identity of Britain’s traditional counties. We welcome the flying of the Lancashire flag in celebration of Lancashire Day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geoff Drive, Leader of Lancashire County Council said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re very pleased that the Department for Communities and Local Government is flying the Lancashire flag to celebrate Lancashire Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lancashire is a county with great history and tradition and a bright future through industries such as aerospace and advanced manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“2012 has been an extraordinary year for Lancashire, with the Open Golf Championships at Royal Lytham, royal visits for the Diamond Jubilee, the Preston Guild and welcoming the Olympic torch relay. Flying our flag at the heart of government will be a fitting end to a tremendous year for our county.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relaxation of regulations for flying flags came into force on 12 October 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inter Faith Week and A Year of Service speech</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to thank you all for coming to this a wonderful event, marking both Inter Faith Week and A Year of Service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks also to the Faith-based Regeneration Network, Mitzvah Day, the Co-exist Foundation and others for their help in making the event a reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, for the people here, it’s Inter Faith Week every week and it’s A Year of Service every year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because day in, day out, you are giving your time, your energy, your hearts and your souls to making your communities better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United by faith and driven by faith - whichever faith that may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the Sikh-run Nishkam Centre in Birmingham, which provides a whole range of training and educational opportunities for local people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Sewa Day, which inspires Hindus across the country to acts of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like the St Vincent de Paul Society, which provides gifts and hospitality to the needy in the run-up to Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These projects and many more prove that faith motivates good works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today you have a government that doesn’t deny that fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a government that supports, celebrates and - in my case - shares that motivation. A government that does God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we know that people who ‘do God’ do good things up and down the country every single day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveys show people of religious observance are more likely to become volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we see that fact in the 30,000 faith-based charities making a difference throughout Britain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="interfaith-action"&gt;Interfaith action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the interfaith movement officially started in 1893 with the ‘World’s Parliament of Religions’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the world’s major religions came together in Chicago for serious discussions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays I don’t think they would have a parliament; they’d have a day of social action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because today interfaith dialogue has become much more about interfaith action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always argued that interfaith shouldn’t just be tea in a draughty church hall or a samosa in the local mosque between the imam and the vicar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t just be clergy to clergy: it should be congregation to congregation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why I helped get a programme called Active Faith off the ground - which, of course, became Near Neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the wonderful projects we see here today are just a small selection of the 300 local projects that have been supported so far.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producing projects like the Departure Café, a drop-in centre and community hub for Tower Hamlets, which I hope to visit soon.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of local congregations coming together to ‘do their bit’ underpin our support for the A Year of Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’ll agree - there can be no better way of marking Her Majesty the Queen’s many years of service to our country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Year of Service has produced some fantastic projects, like the wonderful Mitzvah Mummies, who I went to see yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mothers and their toddlers, meeting, talking to and sharing moments with residents of a retirement home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integenerational interaction - such a simple idea and so effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Minister for Faith and Communities, every day I see the power and the potential of interfaith action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take last Thursday as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a catch-up with the Chief Rabbi… A meeting with Christian groups… An introduction with the Buddhist Network… A speech at my department’s Eid event… And a House of Lords debate on the importance of religion in society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the common thread running through these events wasn’t the fact these people observed a faith. It was that they were inspired to do good things as a result of their belief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why I’m so proud that we have so many local and national 300 inter faith organisations in the UK - more than any other country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why I’m so proud that 3 Faiths Forum, the Joseph Interfaith Foundation, the Christian-Muslim Forum are leading the way in the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s why I am so heartened to see the launch this week of advice to couples and families on interfaith marriages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="stronger-identities"&gt;Stronger identities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had my own theory on inter faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that if you are stronger in your identity then you are more tolerant of others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who don’t associate with people of other beliefs because they think it somehow weakens theirs - they have got it the wrong way round. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if you’re a person who unites with people of other faiths for a common goal - it doesn’t make you less of a Muslim, less of a Hindu, less of a Jew - it makes you more of one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there is no more powerful demonstration of one’s security in one’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I went to the Vatican earlier this year and argued that Europe should be stronger in its Christian identity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Christian heritage of Britain is what has made me feel comfortable here in practising my faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending my daughter to an Anglican convent school made her feel stronger in her identity. When she would swap ‘Amen’ for ‘Ameen’ during the Lord’s Prayer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-future"&gt;The future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain leads the world in its interfaith ethos. But I think we can build on the progress we’ve made since that conference in American back in 1893. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that if we - people of all faiths and none - pull together, we can defeat the intolerance and bigotry faced by people of faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve said before, an attack on a mosque is an attack on a church; an attack on a gudwara is an attack on a synagogue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, an attack on one faith is an attack on all faiths. So let’s be inspired by the story of Siavosh Derakhi, who has recently been recognised for founding Young Muslims Against Anti-Semitism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be inspired by the words of President Obama, following the release of the abhorrent, gratuitously offensive ‘Innocence of Muslims’ film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he said: “to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see when the image of Jesus Christ is desecrated, churches are destroyed, or the Holocaust is denied. Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims, and Shia pilgrims.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be inspired by all the good things that are done and can be done in the name of faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on the subject of inspiration I want to present this beautiful piece of artwork.
Doctor Fox, I know you’re accepting this on behalf of the Evelina Hospital, so thank you, and also to the extremely talented artist Sam Cowan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m off to see some more fantastic artwork now as I go and award the winner of the Faith Through a Lens competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me once again thank you for coming today and thank you for all you do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Nick Boles attends launch of national business competition</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visiting Westminster City School, Nick Boles spoke to the winners of last year’s competition and saw the how they invented a winning product by taking part in an online business game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt=" Nick Boles with students" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1125/mosaicwinners2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Nick Boles speaking to students from Southfields Community College, winners of last year’s competition&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;School teams are supported by specialist business mentors to compete through the game, which places them into a realistic business situation in which they must develop and market a new product and respond to simulated business competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition aims to promote entrepreneurship and inspire knowledge and enthusiasm about business among young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mosaicnetwork.co.uk/en_gb/portal/enterprise-challenge"&gt;Enterprise Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, supported by the department, will this year involve over 3,000 students in 80 schools who will be supported by more than 300 mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Boles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Apax-Mosaic Enterprise Challenge is an excellent way of enabling pupils to learn practical business skills such as sales, marketing and finance from within the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was fantastic to speak to last year’s competition winners and hear how they have benefited from taking part and how much they enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that the Department is supporting this for another year and wish everyone taking part the best of luck.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photos of the event are available from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/communitiesuk/sets/72157632046112497/"&gt;DCLG Flickr channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Faith Minister visits temple to start Diwali celebrations</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neasden Temple is the first traditional Hindu Mandir in Europe and the largest temple outside India. During her visit, the Faith and Communities Minister received a traditional welcome by the trustees of the temple and heard about their work before embarking on a tour of the building. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She met volunteers and heard about the central role the temple plays within the local community and beyond - having attracted devotees and visitors from across the world since it opened in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baroness Warsi was then invited to set off the spectacular fireworks display enjoyed by the thousands of people who had travelled to the temple to mark the beginning of Diwali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baroness Warsi said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every year I look forward to celebrating Diwali, the festival of lights, so it was a particular honour to mark it this year at the magnificent Neasden Temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was fascinating to hear about the central role the temple plays within the local community, from hosting school visits and organising charitable events - and how the Mandir has attracted devotees from all corners of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would like to pay tribute to the trustees and volunteers many hours of devotion and commitment and thank them for the warm hospitality I received during my visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photos of the visit are available from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/communitiesuk/sets/72157632012718099/"&gt;DCLG Flickr channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>An integration nation: breaking down the barriers</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain wouldn’t be the place it is today without the contribution of people from ethnic minority backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of the Commonwealth soldiers who served with the allies in the wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of the immigrants, people like my dad, who came here to build up our industries in the mid 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of our diverse communities contributing to every section of society today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of Mo Farah. Our national hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Mo crossed the finish line - twice - this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nation got behind this London lad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one batted an eyelid over the fact that he was a Somali-born Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, this guy is British - very British.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he told one interviewer: “Look mate, this is where I grew up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is my country and when I put on my Great Britain vest I’m proud.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It said a lot about the diverse, integrated state of our country today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where everyone - black, white and brown - was proud to drape themselves in red, white and blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite great individual examples, there are still barriers to integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today this is more of a problem for us as a country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because today Britain is in a global race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we can’t just rely on Mo Farah to win this one for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a race that pits us against counties around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a huge challenge of global, economic competition that will determine our future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have got a secret weapon to succeed in the global race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The races from around the globe that make up Britain today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our diverse communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with links to places across the world, with business acumen and ideas, with cultural insight and experience and with endless untapped talent and networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s our duty - it’s crucial to our future - to unlock this potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it flies in the face of the survey in which 52% of people said that migrants in Britain were bad for our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I want to focus on what the barriers are to integration and how we can overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="barriers"&gt;Barriers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s look at the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the things that stop people getting on with each other are the same as the things that stop them getting on in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, integration and social mobility are inextricably linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ethnic minority groups have much lower levels of English than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15% of Bangladeshi and 12% of Pakistani women report having little or no English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research shows that English language is the second biggest predictor in occupational success, after qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And 60% of people believe that the biggest barrier to being integrated is not speaking the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to get on top of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution isn’t to throw money at translation and interpretation services or at teaching assistants for non-English speaking pupils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s helping more people to learn English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m delighted at my department’s commitment to fund English language learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s why I want to see us go further, finding new and innovative ways to help people learn English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s a DVD at home, a CD in the car, a volunteer at the community centre, or an after-school club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because a common language is the fundamental basis of common understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just language that holds the key to integration. It’s also got to start in our schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were huge gaps in attainment on the basis of ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With British Caribbean, British Pakistani and British Roma children falling way behind the national average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means freeing up communities to start free schools in areas of deprivation, like the King’s Academy in Bradford, so that everyone, whatever their background, has access to the best schooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means supporting failing comprehensives to become Academies, so that hard done by catchment areas suddenly get the best facilities and the best chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also means changing the way we support and engage with different communities to bring them into the fold - not leave them out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government has moved away from intervention on the basis of race towards increasing the impact of mainstream policies on minority communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backing mainstream organisations, like Youth United, which bring together people of all backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And championing National Citizens’ Service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just funding national bodies, but also supporting local projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My good friend, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, has led the way in this endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spearheading the Big Lunch and the Bandstand Marathon, which have brought people together over food and music - shared experience in shared spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Championing A Year of Service and the Near Neighbours programme, which have united people of different faiths so they can make a difference, together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And driving forward the Localism Act, so people can bid to run local services and shape the areas in which they live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sends out a clear message to our BME communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No longer are you getting the crumbs off the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now have a stake in the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="values"&gt;Values&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, let’s look at our values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people to integrate in our society, I think Britain needs to be better at asserting its values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2006, Tony Blair urged minority communities to adopt British values and to integrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he forgot to point out that Britain needs to be equally sure of its values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nation, we need to be stronger about asserting shared British principles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like freedom, fairness and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opportunity, aspiration and tolerance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing as you would be done by, being proud of the country in which you live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we ask people to sign up to our values if we are not sure of them ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’ve been so outspoken on Britain remembering its Christian heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why I went to the Vatican and called on Europe to assert its Christian identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Christian Britain was more sure of its own identity it would be less rejecting of the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I believe this government’s pro-faith agenda has reflected that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Britain, once again, growing confident of its Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I’ve been so outspoken on the need for schools to teach history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m delighted that Michael Gove has put history at the heart of our curriculum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, as I’ve said for years, how can we know where we’re going if we don’t know where we come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not only must we assert our values - we must ensure those values are afforded to everyone, whatever their faith, colour or creed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For too long authorities have dismissed many of the more difficult issues facing minority communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some said “don’t meddle in these matters”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others steered well clear for fear of offending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been treating our communities like foreign embassies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where rules from abroad apply and wider society keeps well out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for too long, cultural sensitivities have often led our leaders to become morally blind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we’ve dealt with matters differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to forced marriage, we said enough was enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the same with the issue of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where a drug is harming a specific communities it’s not enough to say it’s part of their cultural practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s right to say they deserve the same protection from harmful drugs like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why for many years I have campaigned for the banning of khat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise we should come down equally hard on attitudes that can lead to tragic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I spoke out on the issue of child sexual grooming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said that a small minority of predominantly Pakistani men thought women were second class citizens and white women were third class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if we shy away from the difficult issues in this country, however uncomfortable, we will never confront them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how can people integrate in a society when, in the name of cultural sensitivity, we continue to entrench barriers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="discrimination"&gt;Discrimination&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, let’s look at discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discrimination, intolerance, prejudice and bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to stamp these out if we want our society to be better integrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These un-British traits mean that at best some people feel they don’t belong and at worst their lives and livelihoods are under threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in 2010, we made it a requirement for all police forces to record anti-Semitic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are funding tighter security measures in Jewish faith schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We appointed the first UK Envoy for Post-Holocaust issues, Sir Andrew Burns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are funding the Holocaust Education Trust’s Lessons from Auschwitz project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And are committing further funds to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more than that - we are now finally starting to tackle the more recent scourge of anti-Muslim hatred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we announced last week, we are funding the Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks (MAMA) programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we established the Cross Government Anti-Muslim Hatred Group, allowing us to respond to the growing problem of Islamophobia, department by department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting bigotry and intolerance is key to enable people to integrate, to participate and to reach their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="future-of-britain"&gt;Future of Britain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t afford to let people be held back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be it by language, by education, by discrimination, by disengagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have said, Britain’s migrant communities are key to our future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who better to sell Britain to the world than our diverse communities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whose links extend from Ankara to Islamabad, from Shanghai to Saint-Lucia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who better to offer the world the products it wants?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Than the country that sells naan bread to India; canoes to the Eskimos; tacos to Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who better to rebalance our economy and accelerate our recovery?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Than some of our most can-do businessmen and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our diaspora communities and entrepreneurs hold the key to linking businesses across continents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady Thatcher once said: “Britain is now, more than ever, a multicultural society: and I think that we are beginning to appreciate the challenges and opportunities for learning that this diversity offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A new resilience derived from diversity can only strengthen Britain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates show that our economy is missing out on £8.6 billion a year - probably more - from failing to fully empower people from ethnic minorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine what Britain could do if we unlocked all that untapped talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need to break down these barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expose those opportunities and those values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring people in from the sidelines, into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the young black British boy doesn’t think he’s more likely to fail at school and less likely to get on in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But realises that he is not part of the problem, he’s part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Cameron has called on us to become an aspiration nation if we want to win the global race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we also need to be an integration nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking away those barriers that stop people playing their part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asserting shared British values – and affording everyone those values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing discrimination, tackling bigotry and hatred, wherever they arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, crucially, unlocking the full talent of Britain’s diversity - a diversity which is so essential to our country’s future prosperity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to meeting him and discussing the ways in which the government and the church can continue to work together to improve local communities and increase interactions across all religions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
