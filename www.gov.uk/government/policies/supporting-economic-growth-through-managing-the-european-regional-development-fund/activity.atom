    <title>Successful graduate support scheme secures future with additional £4 million funding</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Midlands European Regional Development Fund Programme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business entrepreneurs emerging from West Midlands universities will continue to be able to access vital support to get a new business venture off the ground, with the announcement of an additional £4million investment to support the programme over the next 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from the success of the SPEED WM programme, phase 2 called SPEED Plus will provide 600 graduates and students with the opportunity to access tailored advice and support focussed on how to get a business idea off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme is supported by just over £2million from the European Regional Development Fund, which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government and matched by five West Midlands universities - the University of Wolverhampton, Birmingham City University, Coventry University, Keele University and Staffordshire University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Retaining graduates and the valuable skills they hold, by helping them to take forward creative entrepreneurial business ideas is really important for the future of the local economy. It is vital that we are able to recognise the success of support programmes such as this and offer additional funding to ensure they continue for the benefit of future graduates and students.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We are looking for future entrepreneurs with great business ideas to come forward and size the opportunities that this project provides, helping to bring their ideas to life and turn them into profitable new businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted that we have been able to play our part in securing the future for this important programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Moore, Deputy Director Graduate Enterprise from The University of Wolverhampton said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are delighted that we will be able to support more and more young people from our partner universities in launching their future business careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPEED WM which was originally launched in 2009, has proved to be a valuable support service, helping 562 graduates and students explore and take forward enterprise ideas over the last 3 years. Mike Chinn and Matt Weston set up Stone’s Throw Media with the assistance of the programme. The video production company based in Wolverhampton, believe that;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without the assistance of SPEED WM we would never have started up this business or have progressed as quickly as we have with all of the support that we have received. SPEED WM is a really important asset to students and graduates who want to start up a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out more about phase 2 of the programme, contact Sarah Taylor at the University of Wolverhampton on &lt;a href="mailto:speed@wlv.ac.uk"&gt;speed@wlv.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt; or visit &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.speed-plus.org"&gt;www.speed-plus.org&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eric Pickles visits Regional Growth Fund success story</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has visited e2v, a high-tech manufacturing company in Essex, to see first hand how Regional Growth fund money is creating jobs and boosting the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e2v were awarded £3.8 million pounds in the third round of Regional Growth Fund grants and the money will help create 130 new jobs at e2v and a further 30 jobs through their supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grant is part of an overall investment of £13.5 million and supports e2v’s strategic plan for growth within its space imaging business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money for e2v is part of the nationwide Regional Growth fund package that sees £1.05 billion in this round that will create or safeguard 240,000 jobs over the long term, benefiting 130 projects and leveraging £6 billion of private sector investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 130 selected bidders to the fund, which will use public money to leverage private sector investment, were whittled down from an initial 414 applications through a competitive process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government investment will help manufacturing firms, small businesses and local partnerships across England to expand their operations create new jobs and stimulate growth - the Government’s top priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst visiting e2v’s manufacturing site, Mr Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The £3.8 million given to e2v is money well spent. It will create jobs for the local Essex economy and boost a company that is a world leader in cutting edge technology. I’ve seen their amazing systems first hand and have rarely witnessed such impressive technology being built here in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Regional Growth Fund is supporting businesses around the country and helping grow the economy. This £1 billion boost to British business is good value for money - with private sector investment of over £6 billion - and creating jobs where they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keith Atwood, e2v’s Chief Executive Officer, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Funding through the Regional Growth Fund is playing an important role in enabling and accelerating our development projects and shows genuine commitment on behalf of the government in supporting manufacturing and sustainable high level job creation in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Regional Growth Fund is a £2.4 billion fund operating across England from 2011 to 2015, intended to stimulate enterprise by providing support for projects and programmes with significant potential for creating long term private sector led economic growth, employment and export opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>West Midlands businesses boost profits with a little help from the virtual world</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Midlands European Regional Development Fund Programme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing businesses in the West Midlands now have the chance to try out and test new product prototypes and ideas through virtual simulation technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of the innovative technology on offer at the University of Birmingham and the Manufacturing Technology Centre in Coventry, will help businesses save time and money with costly repeat experiments which normally go hand in hand with testing new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new project called CASiM2 is supported by £2.6million from the European Regional Development Fund, which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government and matched through funding and staff skills by the University of Birmingham, the Manufacturing Technology Centre, Airbus and Rolls-Royce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In order for businesses to survive and thrive new ways of working that save time and money but still gain the results is key. This project offers businesses an exciting opportunity to try out and explore the innovative technology by putting their new products and ideas to the test in a cost effective, reliable and safe environment. I am pleased that we are able to provide support to a project that will be really beneficial to the future development of businesses in the West Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project will firstly help to raise awareness of the new technology on offer and the benefits it can bring to a business, followed by a demonstration of its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Richard Williams, Pro-Vice Chancellor and Head of the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences, from the University of Birmingham, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are delighted to be driving the translation of our fundamental modelling and manufacturing technology developed at the University of Birmingham into industrial practice through this initiative in collaboration with the Manufacturing Technology Centre and partners. The partnership model encourages the application of frontier science in materials and metallurgical engineering and maximises the speed of adoption. It also enables effective feedback to the academic partners for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delivery of CASiM2 brings together public and private sector organisations providing businesses who participate in the project access not only to the technology, but also valuable credibility from leading companies, Airbus and Rolls-Royce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Burgess, Rolls-Royce Manufacturing Process and Technology Executive said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Advanced computational techniques delivering ‘Virtual Manufacturing’ capabilities continue to be increasingly important to Rolls-Royce as they enable evaluation, optimisation and verification of key manufacturing processes in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional experimental methods. CASIM2 is a collaborative programme that will deliver essential modelling and simulation capability to UK ‘High Value’ manufacturers and their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ken Young, technology director at the Manufacturing Technology Centre added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Manufacturing Technology Centre is proud to be working with the University of Birmingham, along with Rolls-Royce and Airbus to deliver the CASiM2 programme which recognises the fundamental role that SMEs will play in reinvigorating the UK manufacturing sector. CASiM2 will accelerate the delivery of high value manufacturing products and processes through the use of advanced simulation methods to underpin this future growth. Through the programme we have a fantastic opportunity to encourage, promote and transfer knowledge on the application of simulation technologies at an industrial level.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We will engage SMEs in the West Midlands through demonstrating the commercial benefits of using innovative technologies to deliver step changes in their business offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out more about the innovative support on offer, contact Jonathon Shaw, Business Engagement Manager tel: 02476 701649, email: &lt;a href="mailto:jonathon.shaw@the-mtc.org"&gt;jonathon.shaw@the-mtc.org&lt;/a&gt; or John Woodward, Senior Research Facilitator, tel: 0121 414 5158, email: &lt;a href="mailto:j.woodward@bham.ac.uk"&gt;j.woodward@bham.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Future of vital innovation scheme secured with new funding boost</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Midlands European Regional Development Fund Programme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successful and established scheme helping West Midlands businesses boost their innovation and research and development activities is set to continue for another three years after receiving a huge funding boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation Networks Phase 2 seeks to raise the levels of innovation amongst West Midlands small and medium sized businesses by providing grants to groups of companies that can work together and collaborate on the development of innovative new products, processes or services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second phase of this important project is supported by just under £1.9million from the European Regional Development Fund, which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government and matched by investment from the supported businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is vital that we continue to help support projects that have shown real benefits to local businesses and with innovation and research and development activities remaining key to future business development, this truly is an important investment. I am delighted that we are able to provide the support needed that will help keep this scheme alive and assist local businesses and local people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success from Phase 1 really demonstrates how successful and effective this type of support is to local businesses. With 90 small and medium sized businesses supported through grants, nearly £1million of new sales has been generated for the participating companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One business to have experienced first hand the benefits is B&amp;amp;G Products Ltd - a company manufacturing handles for reusable cool bags used for protecting chilled and frozen foods. Based in Stafford and with large supermarket chains as their main customers, B&amp;amp;G had to find ways of retaining these customers whilst reducing production costs and battling with continued pressure to reduce prices. After redesigning their handles B&amp;amp;G used their Innovation Networks grant to purchase new tools to start production reducing the cost of raw materials used by 15 per cent and without sacrificing product quality. By cutting costs they were able to agree to new contracts with major supermarket chains and within six months of launching the new handle B&amp;amp;G had £126,000 of new sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Shorthouse, Assistant Director at Coventry University Enterprises Ltd that manages the scheme said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Innovation Networks project has a great track record of providing practical and accessible support to regional businesses that want to innovate. The flexibility of the scheme makes it attractive to a wide range of businesses, whether they are new start ups or medium sized businesses that are experienced in developing new products. The grant can be used towards any type of project related costs such as the purchase of machinery or tooling, bringing in technical consultancy or buying parts and materials. Any small or medium sized business that is currently planning to develop something new should look at applying for a grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Government welcomes Select Committee acknowledgement of improvements to management of the European Regional Development Fund</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government has issued its response to the Communities and Local Government Select Committee’s report into the European Regional Development Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It welcomed the Committee’s acknowledgement that this Government has done a good job of managing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in England, including, in particular, the transfer of programme administration from the Regional Development Agencies to the Department for Communities and Local Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although welcoming most of the findings in the report, the Government does not agree with the Committee’s view that the transfer led to delays in approving projects and that there was a lack of match funding which affected their development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister responsible for the European Regional Development Fund in England, Baroness Hanham said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the Committee’s acknowledgement of the improvements this Government has made to the management and delivery of English European Regional Development Fund programmes, by transferring responsibilities for their management to the Department.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, I do not believe that this led to delays in the approval of projects. All English programmes met their 2011 spend targets, which is an indication that projects were being approved and processed on time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With regard to the issue of the availability of match funding - at present, some 98 per cent of the 2007-13 English European Regional Development Funding allocation is either contracted or waiting to be contracted, which means that there is match funding in place. Therefore the need for part of the Regional Growth Fund to be ring fenced for ERDF purposes is not at present necessary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Communities and Local Government Select Committee held an inquiry into the European Regional Development Fund earlier this year. The Government submitted written evidence to the Committee in April and Baroness Hanham subsequently gave oral evidence to the Committee on 9 May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Committee published its final report on 13 July. The main areas the Committee investigated were the impact and value for money of ERDF; the role of DCLG in programme management and the provision of match funding; and improvements for the future, 2014-20 programme period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key conclusions in the report are that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ERDF is a highly valuable source of funding for local authorities and other recipients;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the transfer of ERDF management from the Regional Development Agencies to DCLG went well, but there were delays in project approvals and the emphasis on compliance with the EU Regulations has led to more innovative bids being rejected;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is a lack of match funding for ERDF projects, so part of the Regional Growth Fund budget should be set aside to provide match funding;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;many of the EC’s proposals for the 2014-20 programmes are welcome, notably the possibility that Local Enterprise Partnerships could take a greater role in managing ERDF; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;beyond 2020 the Committee would like to see repatriation of the Funds backed with a HM Treasury guarantee that there will be no loss of funding for the poorest regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of ERDF is to reduce the economic disparities between and within Member States, by supporting economic regeneration and creating jobs. DCLG is the Managing Authority for ERDF programmes in England. It oversees 10 Operational Programmes with a total value of €3.2 billion (around £2.8 billion) in the 2007-13 programming period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until July 2011, the Regional Development Agencies carried out the day to day management of ERDF programmes in England. Following the decision to abolish the Regional Development Agencies, DCLG took over responsibility, whilst retaining a locally based ERDF Programme Delivery Team in each Operational Programme area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ERDF generally pays up to 50 per cent of the eligible costs of a project. The remaining match funding must be found by the applicant and can come from a range of public and private sources, including Government funds such as the Growing Places Fund, Broadband UK and the Regional Growth Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2011, the European Commission published the draft Structural Funds Regulations to cover the next, 2014-20, programming period. The Regulations are currently the subject of negotiations between the European Commission and Nation-States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister visits National Football Museum</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob Neill, Olympics Legacy and Growth Minister, visited Manchester last week as the Olympic action kicked off in the city at Old Trafford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while a key reason for his visit was to attend the Olympic Football matches at Old Trafford, he also found time to visit some key projects within the Manchester area, including the landmark and internationally acclaimed National Football Museum in the city centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Museum Director and founder Kevin Moore was on hand to show the Minister, a keen football fan, around the four floors of football artefacts, memorabilia and interactive games and displays. The Museum which has received financial backing from Manchester City Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund, has also received £3.8 million from the North West European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) programme, managed by Bob Neill’s department, the Department for Communities and Local Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2193048.jpg" alt="Olympics Legacy and Growth Minister Bob Neill with Olympic Torch Bearer Claire Dixon at the National Football Museum in Manchester"&gt;Bob Neill with inspirational Olympic Torch Bearer Claire Dixon at the National Football Museum in Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a truly world class attraction which seizes on the local love of football and brings it to life in a fantastic way. The museum will bring many thousands of visitors into the city and the surrounding area and will have a major impact on the local economy, local supply chains and local people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am hugely impressed with what this museum has to offer - an intriguing and inspiring collection complimented wonderfully by the exciting interactive games and displays. I’m definitely coming back so I can spend a whole day here - if you like football you’ll love this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Museum, which has an annual visitor target of 350,000, has been extremely busy since it opened at the beginning of July. Entry to the venue is free with charges only made for some of the interactive games, which include a life-size penalty shoot-out simulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Museum Director Kevin Moore said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Designers asked me if they could just reduce the length of the penalty simulator by 10 centimetres to make it easier to build - I said absolutely not, it’s got to be the full 12 yards. We’ve worked hard to make sure everything is authentic across the whole museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his day in Manchester, the Minister also visited the Enterprise Zone facilities at Manchester Airport and University Hospital South Manchester and another ERDF project, the soon to be opened Media Enterprise Centre at MediaCity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; **European Regional Development Fund in the Northwest
**The European Regional Development Fund is making a real difference to people and businesses in the North West. With €755 million to invest between 2007 and 2013, the Fund is enhancing the competitiveness of the region’s economy by supporting growth in enterprise and employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Regional Development Fund in the North West is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government. For further information visit: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/regenerationfunding/europeanregionaldevelopment/"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/erdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; **The National Football Museum
**The National Football Museum was established and its collection acquired thanks to £9.3 million investment by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The Museum has also received £3.8 million in funding from the European Regional Development Fund and significant financial support from Manchester City Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Football Museum is a registered charity overseen by a board of trustees, and also counts notable names amongst its honorary positions, including Museum President Sir Bobby Charlton, Museum Vice Presidents Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Tom Finney, Sir Trevor Brooking and Sir Geoff Hurst, plus Museum Special Ambassador Mark Lawrenson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum will also provide a permanent home for its nationally-recognised Hall of Fame, with new legends being inducted in a prestigious awards ceremony every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum is expected to attract over 350,000 visitors per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrance will be free, and to enhance the Museum experience, it will include some additional exclusive paid-for interactive exhibitions to help to ensure that visitors enjoy one of the best days out in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; **Claire Dixon
**Claire Dixon was a torch bearer on 23 June in Reedsholme, Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former professional cyclist, Claire’s career was ended abruptly by a life threatening accident in which she suffered a brain haemorrhage and broke her back in two places. She fought back to write and present TV sports programmes, showcase the legacy of world events in Manchester and champion grass routes sports schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>EU Transport Council</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attended the first Transport Council under the Danish Presidency (the Presidency) in Brussels on Thursday 22 March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Presidency sought agreement to a general approach on a proposal for a regulation which defines the Trans-European Transport Network (&lt;abbr title="Trans-European Transport Network"&gt;TEN-T&lt;/abbr&gt;). This sets out the actions to be undertaken at &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and member state level to develop the network. I was able to support the general approach after securing a UK amendment that will ensure that progress on the projects required by the regulation would be subject to the availability of financial resources. This amendment received support from Germany, Latvia, Finland, Romania, Ireland, Bulgaria, Slovenia and France. In my contribution to the debate I also argued that governance structures on corridors should be less burdensome, more flexible and focus on contentious cross-border projects. Most member states supported the compromise text which was viewed as a balance between the commission’s initial proposals and what they could accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The council also agreed a general approach on a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the council on ground-handling services at &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; airports and repealing council directive 96/67/EC. This proposal is part of the airports package. My intervention emphasised the UK’s reservations about the cost impact and administrative burdens of the original proposal, but I acknowledged that these had been largely addressed in the Presidency’s revised text. In particular, I welcomed the removal of compulsory licensing and of the commission’s proposed powers to tell a Member State to close its markets to third country operators that refused to open theirs. Another important point secured in the negotiations in the run up to the meeting was the assurance that service quality would be set locally, with enforcement centred on the contractual relationships between airports, airlines and ground-handlers, with efforts to set homogenised Europe-wide standards removed from the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the light of these changes and the fact that the regulation is expected to deliver more competition in ground-handling at airports in other European countries and hence reduce costs for airlines (and indirectly for passengers), I felt able to support the Presidency’s compromise text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under any other business, the commission set out their future intentions on the follow up to the Costa Concordia accident in Italy in January. They intend to carry out a review of legislative proposals on domestic passenger ships, to be submitted for consideration at the &lt;abbr title="International Maritime Organisation"&gt;IMO&lt;/abbr&gt; (International Maritime Organisation). The Commissioner also indicated there may be a revision to the ship stability directive, and work on watertight doors, with a second wave of regulatory activity later in the year. The Commissioner was supportive of renewed discussion both with the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and the &lt;abbr title="International Maritime Organisation"&gt;IMO&lt;/abbr&gt; on passenger ship safety. Italy gave an account of the emergency response to the accident and noted there would be an administrative enquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intervened to stress the need for a considered response that takes on board the outcome of the investigation currently underway before any decisions are taken as to whether regulatory changes are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also under any other business, the commission provided an update on the international reaction to the inclusion of aviation in the Emissions Trading System (&lt;abbr title="Emissions Trading System"&gt;ETS&lt;/abbr&gt;). The commission reported that the International Civil Aviation Organisation (&lt;abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organisation"&gt;ICAO&lt;/abbr&gt;) had initiated new work to identify a global market based measure for the aviation sector. If this work leads to an international agreement on tackling climate change emissions from aviation, the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; could, as set out in the &lt;abbr title="Emissions Trading System"&gt;ETS&lt;/abbr&gt; Directive, review its legislation. I stressed the importance of maintaining a unified and robust European position and there was clear support from other Member States for the Aviation &lt;abbr title="Emissions Trading System"&gt;ETS&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the council amending council regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport on which the Presidency was hoping for a general approach and the any other business item Galileo and EGNOS programmes on which the commission was providing information, were not discussed at the council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my visit, I was also able to hold a bilateral discussion with the Vice President of the commission, Siim Kallas on the main items for Transport Council discussion. A constructive exchange took place on upcoming commission proposals for airport slots and rail policy. I used the opportunity to highlight the UK’s work with the commission on the better regulation agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also met my counterparts from Cyprus and Ireland to discuss plans for their forthcoming Presidencies of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;, in July-December 2012 and in January-June 2013, respectively. The Cypriots’ main priorities focus on re-energising the Integrated Maritime Policy, and promoting ‘Blue Growth’. The Irish are at an early stage in their preparations and sought UK’s views ahead of their Presidency. My discussion with the Cypriots and Irish ministers also included an overview of the important work that the UK is taking forward with the European Commission on the better regulation agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Hundreds of north east businesses to be created</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A £2Million business support programme for the North East has been unveiled which will help over 1,700 people gain vital business skills and create 431 new businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support will also be given to 164 existing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Support in the North East will allow Local Enterprise Agencies to offer a portfolio of support including hands on support from an Enterprise Coach, an intensive two-day ‘Boot camp’ comprising workshops and one-to-one mentoring as well as support to understand the access to finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This support for emerging pre-start businesses, including high growth businesses, will ensure they reach their full potential and contribute towards economic rebalancing in the North East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is funded by a variety of sources including £1.06m from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Working in a consortium led by North East Enterprise Agencies Ltd (NEEAL) local Enterprise and Development Agencies in the North East have matched this investment with £1.06m of their own funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A significant number of new businesses and new jobs will be created as a direct result of this project ensuring pre-start businesses can harness their full economic potential. Entrepreneurs from communities in all parts of the North East from North Northumberland to the Tees Valley will have access to this excellent business support programme that offers a real chance to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Private sector growth is vital to a strong economy, particularly in the small and medium enterprise sectors, and this project will play an important role in strengthening the North East’s business base contributing to the growth of the local and national economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Support in the North East will ensure that individuals from a variety of backgrounds - with or without experience in enterprise - receive all the required knowledge to successfully establish a business and in doing so, contribute to the North East fulfilling its economic potential. Through local coherent support the project will also help ensure that small businesses seeking support receive the correct guidance to prevent the business from failing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various offers of help available through the project including Enterprise Coaching, Starting a High Growth Business and Understanding Finance for Business, together ensuring businesses are fully equipped for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support through Enterprise Coaching will focus on intensive awareness raising activities followed by intensive hands on support from an experienced and qualified Enterprise Coach, targeting people in employment who possess the skills and resources to start a business and/or those who may be at threat of redundancy, as well as underrepresented groups and disadvantaged areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a High Growth Business package of support will provide an intensive two day ‘Boot Camp’ comprising workshops and one-to-one mentoring to develop the business plan and idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding Finance for Business incorporates support from pre-start stage through to full business establishment ensuring businesses are equipped with knowledge regarding accessing loan funds and when to engage with others for financial help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEEAL was established in 2007 as a consortium comprising the Enterprise and Development Agencies of the North East, all of whom are non-profit organisations providing enterprise support throughout the region. Based at over twenty different locations across the North East, NEEAL has delivered a wide range of publicly funded projects that have contributed to the economic growth of the North East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chairman of NEEAL, Paul McEldon said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted that we have secured the funding for this hugely important work. This funding will enable us to establish a regional and fully cohesive offering for potential business start ups across the region. This will ensure accessible and high quality business support is available to anyone considering starting a business which, given the uncertain environment and the importance of rebalancing the North East economy, is fantastic news for the North East as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ERDF Competitiveness Programme 2007-13 is bringing over £300m into North East England to support innovation, enterprise and business support. It will help create and safeguard 28,000 new jobs, start 3,000 new businesses and increase the region’s productivity by £1.1bn per annum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government is the managing authority for the European Regional Development Fund Programme which runs from 2007 to 2013. This is one of the funds established by the European Commission to help local areas stimulate their economic development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ERDF Competitiveness programme 2007-13 for North East England is focusing on: Innovation - promoting science technology and innovation in businesses and institutions across the region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise and business support - encouraging more people to start up in business, particularly those in disadvantaged areas, and helping established businesses develop, grow and innovate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than £300m ERDF investment is available for the region from 2007-13. ERDF investment is limited to 50 per cent of total eligible cost and must be matched by other public and private sources. For every pound of ERDF investment, regional partners lever in another pound for the key priorities of innovation, enterprise and business support.&lt;/li&gt;

    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new £4.3 million pound low carbon project has been launched in the West Midlands set to help over 120 local building businesses learn about and take forward business opportunities using innovative technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 345 pre-war and Victorian houses will be refurbished to demonstrate the benefits of installing environmental technologies, and put to the test by local residents who will live and benefit from the energy efficient housing driving up demand and creating further opportunities for local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aim High project is supported by over £2.1 million from the European Regional Development Fund which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government, and match funded by Birmingham City Council and the private sector through the British Gas Community Energy Saving Programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project builds upon Birmingham City Council’s investment and commitment to the £100 million Birmingham Energy Savers programme, and will also help businesses get involved in the Government’s ‘Green Deal’ scheme launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Green Deal, which is set to revolutionise the energy efficiency of British properties, will only work if we are able to get local businesses ready to take forward new technologies within the property market. Therefore projects such as this are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s important that we are delivering projects that benefit local businesses and also those that make a difference to the local community and its residents. The energy efficient nature of this project will deliver many benefits for local people such as cheaper fuel bills which is a real benefit in the current climate. I am pleased to be able to announce specific financial support from the European Regional Development Fund to take this forward within the West Midlands and help local businesses grow and diversify, assist local people and improve the local economy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birmingham City Council’s Cabinet Member for Housing, Cllr John Lines, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted that this funding will help to build on the excellent work already undertaken by Birmingham City Council through our Decent Homes and Birmingham Energy Savers programmes. The project will help residents through improved energy efficiency, and also be of great benefit to local businesses, supporting the local economy and the creation of jobs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses will also be able to access support and guidance explaining how to enter the market and form consortiums with like-minded businesses to successfully bid for contracts within this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birmingham is already leading the way in improving the energy efficiency of homes, according to recent government figures. The local authority installed the largest number of insulation measures over the last year (April 2010 to march 2011) through the carbon emissions reduction target and the AIM High project will further enhance the city’s efforts to improve energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
