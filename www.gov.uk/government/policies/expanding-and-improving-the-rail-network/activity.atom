    <title>Passengers to benefit from Olympic boost to services</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music lovers and sports fans travelling to gigs and games will benefit from more convenient train services under plans to make it easier for operators to offer more flexible timetables, Transport Minister Norman Baker announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes, which are being introduced after a successful trial during the London 2012 Games, will mean that on special occasions train operators will be able to adjust a small portion of the timetable to better serve passengers without seeking permission from the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Olympic Games were a massive success and proved our transport system was able to successfully carry record numbers of passengers. We helped train operators cope with the changing demand by giving them more flexibility to give passengers the services they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This has proved such an unqualified success that we have decided to permanently cut the red tape involved in adjusting small portions of the timetable. The changes give train companies the opportunity to ensure passengers are able to plan ahead to ensure they make it to their football matches and concerts and back home again on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Roberts, Chief Executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies (&lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;), said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is good news for passengers. Train companies have been seeking greater freedom to adapt their timetables to suit the needs of their customers and this move will be a big boost for people wanting to enjoy many special events across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes enable operators in England to adapt their timetables to cater for events in the calendar year when changes in passenger demand are expected to be significantly different – such as during sporting and cultural events or during school holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train operators will be allowed to adjust up to 30% of their timetabled services for special occasions, ensuring that more frequent passengers are still able to enjoy regular services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Transport Secretary will retain discretion over all timetable changes and the new measures and passenger benefits gained will be reviewed within the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The General Consent protocol, which enables train operators to adjust a small portion of their timetables for special events, was trialled with Southern Trains from the 17 April – 23 June 2012. This was then extended to all English train operators during the London 2012 Games.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The decision follows the success of the pilots and following consultation with Passenger Focus, London TravelWatch and &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Secretary of State is not responsible for the management of services within Scotland and Wales&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Minister views multi-billion pound plans for the north west</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major upgrade to rail links which will bring over £4 billion of economic benefits to the north west is progressing well, said Transport Minister Simon Burns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister visited Manchester and Liverpool today to see for himself work on the Northern Hub and plans for the electrification of rail lines – both projects could bring up to 30,000 jobs to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Hub will see a new rail link being built (the Ordsall Chord), stations extended and journey times improved while the electrification programme will enable faster, more reliable and greener trains to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Burns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Transport provides the crucial links that allow individuals and communities to prosper and that is why this investment is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Commuters and businesses in the region will be big winners thanks to quicker and greener trains and more services across Manchester. But these improvements will also benefit the UK as a whole due the crucial role the north west plays in the country’s transport system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This investment demonstrates that the government is delivering on its commitment not only to improve the transport system but also to use it as an engine to drive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his visit the minister toured Manchester Airport and Manchester Airport railway station where he viewed plans for a 4th railway platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new platform will increase capacity by enabling the station to accommodate longer and more trains. He also visited Piccadilly station which will have extra platforms as part of the Northern Hub project and toured Tuebrook Sidings, in Liverpool, which is 1 of 13 compounds which will be used to store materials during the second phase of the north west electrification scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Northern Hub is a series of proposed projects to boost economic growth through better train services across northern England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The individual projects were identified in a study published by Network Rail in February 2010&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In July 2012 the government announced it was backing the full scheme. The full package of enhancements is set to be in place by 2019&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s electrification programme will also see rail lines on the Great Western Main Line electrified all the way to the South Wales Valleys. The Midland Main Line between Bedford and Sheffield will also be electrified&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A study by Network Rail estimates the investment will bring over £4 billion of wider economic benefits to the north west resulting in 30,000 new jobs&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Boxing day boost for bargain-hungry passengers</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bargain hunters will find it easier to get to the sales this year under plans to boost Boxing Day rail services, Transport Minister Norman Baker announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra rail services – which will make it easier for shoppers to access retail hubs in central London, Stratford and Kent – are being provided thanks to an agreement between the Department for Transport, Southeastern, and &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt; Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have devised a unique agreement to enable Southeastern and &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt; to make it easier for their passengers to get to the sales following Christmas, which will provide more services at no cost to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Southeastern ran some very successful services on High Speed 1 during the Olympics and the train operator has shown there is sufficient demand for these services so we were happy to consider allowing them to adjust their timetables. This is an excellent example of the government, infrastructure owners and train operators working innovatively together to improve services for passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeastern’s managing director, Charles Horton said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re really pleased to offer this trial Boxing Day service for our passengers thanks to the collaboration with &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt; and the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;. Our high speed Javelin service will transport people from Ashford to St Pancras International in just 37 minutes, and 19 minutes from Ebbsfleet. We’re also pleased to offer free parking at these 2 stations for Boxing Day so everyone has a little bit extra to spend in the sales!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Ruse, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt; Ltd, the company that owns High Speed 1 said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Demand for high speed rail travel is rising all the time and this welcome example of teamwork on the railways means we can offer high speed rail customers a service that will prove hugely popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The half hourly service will run between Ashford International, Ebbsfleet International, Stratford International and St Pancras International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeastern and &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt; Ltd ran a special timetable through the Olympics and Paralympics with extra high speed services to carry spectators to and from Stratford International.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nuneaton North Chord event</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for asking me along today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m genuinely delighted to be here because what you’ve achieved with this new chord really matters. And let me tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, today we earn our living in a global marketplace - one where what we sell in Boston or Shanghai is just as important as what we make in Bristol or Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that rail freight is more important than it’s ever been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving products and raw materials quickly and reliably - that’s how you power up the recovery and grow the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="economic-sense-environmental-sense"&gt;Economic sense, environmental sense&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although this new chord isn’t massive in scale like Crossrail or &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;, it’s certainly a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investment worth more than £25 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investment that will allow freight traffic to travel through Nuneaton station, without affecting passenger services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investment that means better and faster links between the global gateway of Felixstowe and the Midlands, the north west and Scotland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this new chord makes sound economic sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you consider the chord’s potential to cut carbon emissions and ease traffic congestion by attracting freight from road to rail, then it soon becomes obvious that it makes environmental sense too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusions---right-investment-right-project-right-reasons"&gt;Conclusions - right investment, right project, right reasons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add all that up and what you have is the right investment, in the right project, for the right reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, before I finish I just want to say a big thank you to everyone who made this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have done a terrific job of work and, if I had a hat, I’d take it off to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on that note it is now my absolute pleasure to declare the Nuneaton North Chord officially open (minister unveils plaque).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Peterborough Station makeover – official opening</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along. It’s a genuine pleasure to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my officials first asked me if I was interested in a makeover, I thought they meant for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for my self-esteem the officials in my private office eventually put me straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The makeover is right here at Peterborough Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, looking around, I can see that every penny of that £3 million was well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-makeover-that-really-delivers"&gt;A makeover that really delivers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a new station front, a bigger main concourse and a much brighter interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a new information point, as well as a new customer waiting area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People using the station will feel safer and more secure thanks to improved &lt;abbr title="Closed Circuit Television"&gt;CCTV&lt;/abbr&gt; coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated ticket machines mean less hassle and more convenience for passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, talking of convenience, even the toilets have been refurbished.
Looked at from any angle, this is a makeover that really delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m pleased to say it doesn’t stop there. Because I understand there’s more to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be new lifts and footbridges, as well extra and longer platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all the work is due to be completed by the end of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bigger-picture"&gt;Bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, the passenger friendly changes we see here are part of a much bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we’re actually engaged in a massive rail modernisation effort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new services and extra carriages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more seats and faster journeys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;transforming conventional rail and backing rail high speed rail &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From massive, multi-billion pound projects like Crossrail, to smaller multi-million pound projects like Peterborough, we’re renewing and rebuilding Britain’s railways and making them truly fit for the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="team-effort"&gt;Team effort&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that it takes a real team effort to pull off something like this - from back office to building site, from accountants to architects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as far as I’m concerned, it doesn’t matter if you were sat in front of a computer or you wore a hard hat, or whether you’re from Network Rail or part of East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were involved in modernising this station then you should feel very proud of yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I’d like to take this opportunity to applaud you for an absolutely fantastic job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common interests and a common purpose….coming together and working together to achieve this station improving, passenger friendly end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a big thank-you for all of your hard graft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks--cutting-ribbonplaque-unveiling"&gt;Concluding remarks – cutting ribbon/plaque unveiling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience “I wish they’d gone on longer” is rarely a tribute paid to a public speaker, especially a politician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, without any further ado, it’s an honour and a privilege to declare this station open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>New headquarters for rail accident investigators</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin today officially opened the new premises of the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (&lt;abbr title="Rail Accident Investigation Branch"&gt;RAIB&lt;/abbr&gt;), the independent investigators working to make the railways safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The southern team of the &lt;abbr title="Rail Accident Investigation Branch"&gt;RAIB&lt;/abbr&gt; is now based at Cullen House, near Aldershot, Hampshire, on the same site as the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB). Previously the team were based in Woking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick McLoughlin said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rail is significantly safer now than in previous years because the industry has ensured safety issues have been identified and safeguards introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Rail Accident Investigation Branch"&gt;RAIB&lt;/abbr&gt; is helping to ensure that our safety record continues to improve by carrying out thorough investigations when something goes wrong and identifying what needs to change to prevent it happening again. The new premises at Cullen House give the &lt;abbr title="Rail Accident Investigation Branch"&gt;RAIB&lt;/abbr&gt; an excellent base from which to carry out their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Inspector Carolyn Griffiths said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cullen House provides a continuing presence for the &lt;abbr title="Rail Accident Investigation Branch"&gt;RAIB&lt;/abbr&gt; in the south east which together with its northern team in Derby provides a balanced coverage for the geographical territory we investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To date since becoming operational in 2005 we have completed 196 investigations The industry has implemented 95% of recommendations from those investigations, bringing about real changes that improve safety for passengers and those who work on the railways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a visit to Cullen House, Patrick McLoughlin met &lt;abbr title="Rail Accident Investigation Branch"&gt;RAIB&lt;/abbr&gt; staff and unveiled a plaque marking the official opening of the new premises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new premises are named after Lord Cullen who in 2000 led a public enquiry into the Ladbroke Grove rail crash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sole purpose of &lt;abbr title="Rail Accident Investigation Branch"&gt;RAIB&lt;/abbr&gt; investigations is to prevent future accidents and incidents and improve railway safety - the &lt;abbr title="Rail Accident Investigation Branch"&gt;RAIB&lt;/abbr&gt; does not establish blame, liability or carry out prosecutions&lt;/li&gt;
