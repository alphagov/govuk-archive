    <title>Communities Secretary Eric Pickles responds to the riots 1 year on</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Anyone who disrupts the communities and livelihoods of our citizens will face the full force of justice. Since last August the Government has sent the strongest possible signal that mindless criminality will not be tolerated ever. Over 1,900 people were swiftly brought to justice and the average sentence was over four times longer than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Government made millions of pounds available to councils to quickly help reopen shops and rebuild communities affected by the riots, and made sure the police continue to build positive relationships with those areas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“We are determined to see our young people given the best start in life. We are supporting those most in need via the Youth Contract which will provide support worth almost £1 billion, to young people, including wage incentives for ‘youth unemployment hotspots’ - and are going into the homes of 120,000 of the nation’s most troubled families to address root causes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“At this time we must also remember the acts of selfless kindness shown by the many people who stood up and joined the ‘broom brigade’, which were in stark contrast to the reckless criminal minority that perpetrated this disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Councils to get 100% help to clear up after floods</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government has set out the help that it is giving to councils following the record breaking rainfall over recent weeks that has had a devastating effect on many parts of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers in the Department for Communities and Local Government said that they would look sympathetically on councils where they have costs as a result of the floods, and announced that they would reimburse councils for 100 per cent of their clearing-up expenditure under the Bellwin scheme. Councils have a vital role, along with the emergency services, in responding to such events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I know that many households and businesses have been disrupted by the floods that have affected parts of the country. That is why we have announced that we will reimburse councils 100 per cent of their costs under the Bellwin scheme which will help councils clear-up streets removing debris from roads and footpaths, shore up buildings and remove dangerous trees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I am writing to all councils affected to see what practical support they need and the Government is continuing to monitor the situation carefully.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activation of the Bellwin scheme was announced in a Written Ministerial Statement to Parliament by the Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman, recording that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is activating the Bellwin Scheme of Emergency Financial Assistance to help local authorities with their immediate costs associated with protecting life and property in their areas. Exceptionally, the scheme will reimburse local authorities for 100 per cent of their eligible costs above threshold. This is in recognition of the particular circumstances around these floods and will give the affected local authorities assurance that such costs will be reimbursed. Government officials will also be discussing the recovery arrangements with local authorities in the areas affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils, police, fire and National park authorities are eligible for Bellwin reimbursement when they have spent more than 0.2 per cent of their calculated annual revenue budget on works that have been reported to the Department as eligible for grant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has decided that on this occasion it will reimburse 100 per cent of the costs above the threshold, instead of the standard 85 per cent as stated in the Bellwin scheme guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ministers see riot-recovery underway in Greenwich, Manchester and Salford</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers have visited more towns that were badly affected by the riots, to see progress six months on and meet the local people, traders and council workers getting their communities back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Secretary of State Eric Pickles visit to Tottenham last week, Local Government Minister Bob Neill visited Woolwich and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell headed to Manchester and Salford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the riots the Government acted quickly to make available a multi-million pound package of support to enable councils to act swiftly and confidently to restore communities and get support to local people and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="woolwich"&gt;Woolwich&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Neill returned to Woolwich to see first hand how the community is using the support available to restore, rebuild and improve the town centre. He was first there in the immediate aftermath of the riots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling into local businesses, Mr Neill talked to traders about the impact of the riots and how the community rallied round to help get them get back on their feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local council leader Chris Roberts and Chief Executive Mary Ney accompanied the Minister. The council set up the Greenwich Backing Local Business fund and opened a special advice surgery for more than 60 businesses to drop in to get expert advice and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Bob Neill said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The picture here in Woolwich is very different to the one I saw in the immediate aftermath of the riots. Despite the attempts of a few to wreak havoc, the community in Woolwich have pulled together to restore their town.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The progress well underway in Woolwich is symbolic of a community that is proud of their local area, their local businesses and determined to see their town thrive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="manchester-and-salford"&gt;Manchester and Salford&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting local people, traders and council workers in Manchester and Salford, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell praised the energetic way communities came together in the aftermath of the riots and pointed to the true examples of community spirit in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Whilst the actions of a small minority determined on causing destruction caught our attention for a moment, it is the examples of true community spirit that will endure; the ‘broom armies’, the campaigns to support local businesses, the messages of pride in the area posted on shop fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“It’s been great to meet the people that paint the real picture of community life in Manchester and Salford and see that recovery and progress is well underway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Stunell also met with council leaders in both areas to discuss the impact of the riots and the support improvement in the areas. An ‘I love Salford’ campaign was launched to build up the community spirit and invite people to show their support for their area by shopping locally and wearing campaign badges. In Manchester a campaign group called ‘Eye on Manchester’ rallied support from locals to help in the clean up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles responds on behalf of Her Majesty's Government to the interim report from the Independent Riots Victims and Communities Panel.</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We welcome the interim report from the Independent Riots Victims and Communities Panel into the serious events of last summer and will be studying its findings carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The riots which took place in our towns and cities in August were shocking acts of criminality which ruined businesses, brought destruction to our streets, and made people feel unsafe in their own homes. But we also saw the law abiding majority reclaiming the streets by protecting friends and neighbours, and helping with the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“As the Prime Minister stated in the aftermath of these disturbances, it is vital that we fully understand and tackle the root causes and do what we can to prevent the scenes from being repeated. The interim report states that “there was no single cause of the riots and there is no single solution”. Our response to the riots has been and continues to be wide-ranging. We are embarked on a programme of action to tackle entrenched problems like the most troubled families, educational attainment and many other fundamental issues which can give people a stake in society and prevent such disorder from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The Riots Panel has given a voice to those directly affected. We hope this work will add to the understanding of the causes of the disorder, and we now look forward to the final report.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government action already taken in response to the riots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In August 2011 the Deputy Prime Minister announced the establishment of an Independent Riots Communities and Victims Panel, led by Darra Singh, to report on wider lessons from the August disorder: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/riot-communities-and-victims-panel-announced-0"&gt;http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/riot-communities-and-victims-panel-announced-0&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Government’s first priority was to provide the police and other agencies with the support and powers they needed to protect individuals, communities and businesses and to get local communities back on their feet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have already announced we are extending gang injunctions to 14-17 year olds and rolling out by the end of the year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have launched a consultation on police powers of curfew and the right to remove face coverings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Home Secretary has asked Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Sir Denis O’Connor, to review the police response and the lessons learned.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Home Secretary, with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has been leading a cross-government programme of action to tackle gangs and serious youth violence, a problem that blights too many of our streets and communities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Home Secretary has been talking to police forces up and down the country as well as to local agencies, charities, youth organisations and others involved in front-line work to tackle youth violence, as well as hosting an international forum, and will present a report to Parliament shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Government is introducing radical changes to ensure both effective punishment for criminals and introduce reform to break the cycle of offending. We are making our jails places of hard work, getting criminals off drugs and alcohol, toughening community sentences and making offenders pay back to victims and communities for their crimes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Prime Minister announced on 15 August 2011 that the Government would be reviewing social policy in response to the disturbances.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This review of social policies covers a number of Government departments and is looking at a range of issues regarding the ‘broken society’ -  schools, family policy, parenting, communities, health and safety, cultural, legal, bureaucratic problems, services the Government provides and how they are delivered and the signals that Government sends about the kind of behaviours that are encouraged and rewarded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Central to this work is a commitment to turning around the lives of the 120,000 most troubled families by 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ministers have made it clear that tackling youth unemployment is a priority, with the growth in apprenticeships and work experience opportunities key to giving young people a head start in finding and keeping a job with a future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private and voluntary sector organisations are investing £581m upfront in the biggest welfare to work programme this country has ever seen to provide tailored support built around the needs of individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are addressing the educational underclass in areas let down for decades - by setting high standards for every child; making no excuses for failure; and fostering real pride in their schools. We are also driving up participation in education and training, so every young person has the skills to get into further study and employment - and to cut the chances of unemployment, poor health and a drift into crime. And intervening earlier to address poor parenting, support families with multiple problems and give opportunities to young people outside school - to overturn poor aspirations and attainment.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Fire Minister attends national memorial service to pay tribute to victims of 9/11 and firefighters</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire Minister Bob Neill has paid tribute to victims of the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001 and for firefighters who have lost their lives in the line of duty at a memorial service held at St Paul’s Cathedral. This was followed by a wreath laying ceremony at the National Firefighters Monument at Sermon Lane, near St Paul’s Cathedral in the City of London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire Minister Bob Neill said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It is an honour to lay a wreath on behalf of the Government in memory of those who lost their lives in such an appalling act of terrorism. It is important that we pay tribute not just to those who perished, but their families and friends and all those affected by the events of that terrible day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“This is also an occasion to remember those firefighters nearer to home who have paid the ultimate price for protecting their communities and ensure that their bravery and sacrifice is never forgotten.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Memorial service of remembrance takes place annually each year. The service is organised by the Firefighters Memorial Trust which is a Registered Charity. Sir Ken Knight is the founder Vice-Chairman of the Trust. HRH the Princess Royal is a patron of the Trust. Lee Howell, Chief Fire Officer Devon and Somerset FRS and Vice President of the Chief Fire Officers Association, is a Trustee of the Firefighters Memorial Charitable Trust.

    <title>The riots one month on: the good work must continue</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week marks one month since the worst of the rioting hit the streets of some of our biggest cities. Since then, councils have been pulling out all the stops to get affected areas back to normal, local businesses back up and running, and those forced to move out of their homes back into safe and stable accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within days of the riots taking place, the Government launched a multi million pound package of support to overcome the immediate recovery issues that communities and businesses were facing and to help them get back on their feet. The latest figures show that 30 local authorities are making use of the funds to support the small traders, businesses and families in their area that were directly affected by the riots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money has been used for a wide range of support measures - from helping small businesses with upfront costs like insurance excesses, building repairs, and carrying out safety checks, to reducing business rates and encouraging customers back into affected areas. It has also been used to meet the immediate costs of emergency accommodation for families who have been made homeless and offer council tax discounts or relief to those whose homes have been damaged but are still habitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities played a key role in the immediate recovery operation and continue to lead the way by administering the support schemes, which are delivering tangible results and making a real difference to communities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.croydon.gov.uk/advice/emergencies/civil-unrest/latest-information"&gt;Croydon Council&lt;/a&gt; (external link) has opened a temporary ‘one stop shop’ to provide people affected by the civil unrest with immediate advice and support on everything from insurance claims to housing and emergency benefits. A £100,000 ‘Family Support Fund’ has also been made available to families directly affected to cover short-term costs and bring about a sense of normality - for example using the money to buy school uniforms for the new school year, or to meet higher rental costs of temporary accommodation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.manchester.gov.uk/news/article/6047/council_announces_support_package_for_riot-hit_businesses"&gt;Manchester City Council&lt;/a&gt; (external link) has reduced business rates to businesses in the city and made grants of up to £2,500 and loans available to those who took a direct hit from the riots. The city also launched the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/100009/events_leisure_and_tourism/5228/i_love_mcr"&gt;I Love MCR campaign&lt;/a&gt; (external link) to demonstrate pride in the city and encourage people back to shop, eat, drink and socialise in the city.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ealing.gov.uk/homepage/64/riot_recovery"&gt;Ealing Council&lt;/a&gt; (external link) has a £250,000 fund to help independent traders that suffered damage from vandals and looters, helping them pay for things like new glazing and building repairs. The council has also offered interest free repayable grants to the worst affected small traders, which are likely to have to remain closed for up to six months.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/News/2011/220811LambethBusinessCommunitiesWorkingTogether.htm"&gt;Lambeth Council&lt;/a&gt; (external link) has been holding ‘drop in’ surgeries for businesses to learn more about the recovery support available, how to apply for funds to tide them over while they get back on their feet again, and get help filling out compensation forms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The support packages were part of concerted, cross-Government action to help rebuild communities, open up shops and buildings which were damaged, make sure people who lost their homes were re-housed, and to help councils get their areas back to normal as quickly as possible. The measures announced included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a £10million Recovery Scheme which was put in place to help councils with the immediate costs of making their areas safe, clear and clean again, and to enable them to provide council tax discounts to affected residents.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a £20million High Street Support Scheme to support Small and Medium sized business affected by the disturbances by providing business rate hardship relief, rebuilding confidence and helping affected businesses get back up and running.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a £1million Homelessness Support Scheme which met the immediate costs of re-housing those made homeless by the disturbances with a maximum payment threshold of up to £5,000 per household, with discretion applied for exceptional costs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a £20million London Enterprise Fund to kick-start economic growth and regeneration mainly in Tottenham and Croydon, to be administered by the Mayor of London alongside his £50million recovery fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures came on top of support for individual homeowners and businesses under the Riot (Damages) Act and local authorities under the Bellwin Scheme, and a £3million ‘High Street Fund’ set up with contributions from the Mayor, leading UK companies and local authorities to offer initial recovery grants to small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, the Secretary of State is meeting with the leaders of those local authorities affected by the riots to discuss how to restore commercial and community confidence in affected areas, and any difficulties they are facing in recovering from the disturbances or any barriers that need addressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whilst areas are given time to recover and return to normality, they have pledged to continue to work closely with councils and provide support at a national level to ensure that every business forced to close, and every family forced to move, are helped back into their community as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
