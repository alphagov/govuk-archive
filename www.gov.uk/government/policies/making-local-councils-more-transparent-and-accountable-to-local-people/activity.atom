    <title>Local authority revenue expenditure and financing England: 2010 to 2011 individual local authority data</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data in the above spreadsheets have been used to compile the final outturn estimates of local authority revenue expenditure and financing for the financial year April 2010 to March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the publication of the original final outturn statistical release (4 April 2012), the data in these spreadsheets have been revised on 27 November 2012. The changes over the previously published figures are generally small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>National non-domestic rates collected by local authorities in England 2011-12 (update)</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An updated statistical release giving details of the national non-domestic rates collected by local authorities in England in 2011-12 was published on 20 November 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provided updated information on figures that were announced on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-domestic-rates-collected-by-local-councils-in-england-2011-to-2012"&gt;15 August 2012&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics release includes data from 2007-08 to 2011-12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the net rate yield (after allowances for changes in respect of previous years and reliefs) increased by 9.1% to £21 billion in 2011-12&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the contribution to the pool (net rate yield after allowances for collection costs including losses) also increased by 9.2% to £20.7 billion in 2011-12&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;between 2007-08 and 2011-12 the contribution to the pool from the local lists increased by £3.5 billion or 21%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London accounts for 29% of the contribution to the national pool while having only 15% of the population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Eric Pickles acts to limit town hall chiefs' golden goodbyes</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow and costly bureaucracy that requires councils to appoint an independent person, usually a Queen’s Counsel, to review dismissal and disciplinary cases for chief executives is to be changed. The Isles of Scilly Council has recently suspended its chief executive pending one of these investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils seeking to dismiss a chief executive for misconduct or poor performance often pay out inflated lump sums to avoid the cost of taking this bureaucratic route. Eric Pickles intends to remove this expensive roadblock, which does not exist in other parts of government or the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local government estimates the review process can cost between £100,000 and £250,000 in legal fees not counting independent investigation costs and salary for the suspended officer. One case cost £420,000 and took 16 months to adjudicate. Ministers believe decisions by full council ensure proper democratic accountability, without the need for a centrally dictated process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post of chief executive is not set in statute, which means there are no central barriers to removing the role. It only takes a simple democratic decision by the council. Several councils have done this in the past year. The statutory head of paid service role can be done by another senior officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles has also today written to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.local.gov.uk/" title="Local Government Association"&gt;Local Government Association&lt;/a&gt; to urge them to take steps to improve their performance management of senior posts. Better management can make it easier and quicker to tackle performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A town hall chief executive costs a lot of money, but if they are simply not up to the job, councillors must be able to get rid of them quick smart without having to throw away thousands in parachute pay-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is ridiculous that councils feel forced to give bumper pay offs to dismiss inadequate chief executives simply to avoid these unnecessary golden goodbye reviews from expensive lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Scrapping this bizarre bureaucratic ritual will save taxpayers money and put the decision firmly back in democratically elected hands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act requires councils to publish their pay policies so that local remuneration arrangements - particularly for chief officers - are out in the open and provide value for money for local taxpayers. The associated guidance states councils should vote on pay deals over £100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles announced he intends to toughen up the guidance before councils publish their pay policies for next year. For example, if smaller councils do not pay staff above £100,000 they should consider setting a lower vote threshold. Ministers will reserve the right to regulate should councils not act on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also states that councils should also publicly justify any big bonuses; above inflation pay rises; hiring staff already in receipt of public sector retirement or severance money; and avoid any perceptions of minimising tax payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a public worried about the cost of living and all parts of the public sector looking to make deficit savings, ministers believe these steps will show taxpayers that value for money is being fully considered for top paid staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Changes to the Audit Commission Board</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of appointment for 7 commissioners comes to an end on 31 December 2012. The Secretary of State has taken the decision, with support from the chairman of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/Pages/default.aspx" title="Audit Commission"&gt;Audit Commission&lt;/a&gt;, to offer reappointment 4 of the existing board members, and a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://publicappointments.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/" title="Public Appointments website"&gt;recruitment exercise&lt;/a&gt; has commenced to find 3 new members of the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new commissioners will work alongside other board members to achieve an efficient and effective closedown and, in the lead up to closure, oversee the smaller Commission’s remaining duties and the transfer of continuing functions to other bodies. The full programme of reforms to local audit and inspection, and the closure of the Commission, will bring in a more localist approach and are expected to save £650 million in public money over the next 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Localism in action - making it easier to set up parish councils</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government’s revolution to hand power back to local communities moves one step further today under proposals to makes it easier to set up new town and parish councils announced by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/parishdiscussionpaper"&gt;consultation&lt;/a&gt; launched today is part of government plans to open up public services. It proposes amending existing guidance to speed up the process, clarifying how local authorities should consider local opinion, and making it easier for neighbourhood forums to start the process for creating a new parish council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cracking down on pointless bureaucracy and freeing local people who want to play an active part in society to create successful and thriving communities is a top priority for this government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government believes where the creation of a new parish council has the support of local people, the local authority should work with the community to achieve it. This will enable decision making to be devolved to the lowest appropriate level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Parishes are popular with people and for too long communities have battled with burdensome bureaucracy to get them created.
&amp;gt; “Our proposal to remove red tape, simplify and streamline the current process to create Parish councils is commonsense.
&amp;gt; “We want to give local people a real sense of community control in their areas, giving them freedom to make changes and improvements which best serve their community and area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parish councils have a highly significant role in the Government’s agenda for promoting localism and open public services. They have a close understanding of what their communities want and can tailor a wide range of local services including grants to local organisations and financing projects such as new community buildings and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the proposals Councillor Michael Chater, Chair of the National Association of Local Councils (NALC) said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We welcome the creation of more new local (parish and town) councils to deliver wider services to local communities and be the voice of local people. We agree with the proposal to consult on how local councils could be given more power to deliver grassroots services and looking forward to hearing of innovative and radical approaches on how this will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parish and town (local) councils in England and community and town (local) councils in Wales are the first tier of local government. There are around 10,000 local councils in England and Wales, made up of nearly 100,000 councillors.

    <title>Local authority capital expenditure and receipts in England: 2011 to 2012 final outturn</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on the final outturn figures of local authority capital expenditure and receipts in the financial year April 2011 to March 2012 was released on 30 October 2012 under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release includes data from 2007 to 2008 to 2011 to 2012 and updates those statistics previously released on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-capital-expenditure-and-receipts-in-england-2011-to-2012-provisional-outturn-and-2012-to-2013-forecast"&gt;28 June 2012&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-capital-expenditure-and-receipts-england-2011-to-2012"&gt;11 September 2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditure by local authorities in England has fallen to £20.0 billion in 2011 to 2012, a year-on-year decrease of 13%, due mainly to a fall in new construction and conversion, and lower grants, loans and other financial assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditure rose steadily from £19.8 billion in 2008 to 2009 to £23.1 billion in 2010 to 2011, but has fallen back in 2011 to 2012 to £20.0 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capital receipts, excluding housing revenue account self-financing determination and premium, rose to £2.0 billion in 2011 to 2012, a year-on-year increase of nearly 34%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
