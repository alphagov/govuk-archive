    <title>David Cameron "OECD - a force for good"</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PM congratulated the Secretary General on the OECD’s 50th Anniversary this year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting, Mr Cameron said &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Government’s top priority is reducing the nation’s deficit and returning Britain to strong and sustainable growth.  That means the right economic policies at home and creating the right economic environment abroad.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As part of our work to get the global economy back on its feet the UK will continue to champion the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. It’s one of the world’s major international economic organisations and a force for good in building the intellectual and political case for open markets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today I welcomed its Secretary-General, Angel Gurria, to No 10 Downing Street.  Over the last five years he has revitalised the OECD and reinforced its role as a world leader in analytical and policy advice. And on the occasion of his visit to London, I congratulated the Secretary-General on the OECD’s 50th Anniversary.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK was one of the founding members of the OECD in 1961. The last 50 years has seen enormous growth in living standards in all regions of the world and the OECD has played a major role in fostering, supporting and sustaining that growth.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the OECD has a vital to role to play in today’s world economy. Through its engagement with the world’s emerging as well as developed economies, the OECD has the experience and the commitment to deliver on its declared aim: to promote ‘better policies for better lives’ in its Member States and in the wider world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
