    <title>"Fair funding, sensible savings and bill freeze is the right road for councils" says Eric Pickles</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New style local settlement to reward striving councils with more income.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles spelled out 50 sensible savings, a Council Tax freeze and a fair funding deal as the “right road” for councils to protect residents and local services, as a major shake up of local finance was initiated today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister signalled the watershed moment for councils as he unveiled a new look local government finance settlement that will reward councils that strive to improve their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dramatic shift in spending power from Whitehall to the town hall means an estimated 70% of council income will now be raised locally compared to 56% under the centrally distributed ‘begging-bowl’ formula grant system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From April 2013 councils can channel this greater local control into encouraging local jobs and local firms via a new business rate retention incentive that rewards them for growth. It could potentially add £10 billion to the economy by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, councils account for a quarter of all public spending - with English councils still spending £114 billion - so it is vital they continue to play their part tackling the inherited budget deficit by making sensible savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help councils in that regard a document containing &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/50-ways-to-save-examples-of-sensible-savings-in-local-government"&gt;50 practical ways to make sensible savings&lt;/a&gt; was published today. It shows how a culture change by councils can unearth significantly more taxpayer savings and help make services more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Councils must keep doing their bit to tackle the inherited budget deficit because they account for a quarter of all public spending and still get through over £114 billion of taxpayers money each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s announcement is a fair funding deal that will reward councils ready to strive for their communities and gives them another year to get their house in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Councils must do 3 things to get on the right road for their residents: put our fair funding deal to work; do every single one of our 50 ways to save; and accept our Council Tax freeze offer. Councils that cry wolf without having done all of this are letting their residents down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Councils that put their thinking caps on now can save precious taxpayer pennies next year by cutting out waste and transforming frontline services that vulnerable people rely on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s fair funding deal arms councils with an average spending power of £2,240 per household. Local authorities have been protected from further spending reductions for 2013 to 2014. Overall the average spending power reduction for councils in 2013 to 2014 is expected to be limited to just 1.7% per household, less than last year’s comparable figure of 3.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers believe this important concession gives councils the time they need to transform service delivery, build up their local business rate income, improve procurement and comprehensively complete the suggested 50 savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total start-up funding assessment for councils 2013 to 2014 apportions £26 billion in a fair and sustainable way that ensures the smallest reductions for the councils most reliant on government support. More weighting has been given to areas with the highest levels of assessed need. For example, Newcastle has a spending power per household of £2,522 which is over £700 more than the £1,814 per household in Wokingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is setting aside an extra £450 million over the next 2 years to help local government in England to freeze their Council Tax, equivalent to a 1% rise. A third year’s combined Council Tax freeze is potentially worth over £200 to band D residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government confirmed today that where a council rejects the freeze, the majority will have to secure electoral agreement through a ‘local tax lock’ referendum to hike band D bills by more than 2%. Smaller authorities with a track record of low Council Tax will be given slightly more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘50 ways to save’ include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sharing back offices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;adopting Community Budgets to bring staff and money together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using transparency to cut waste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clamping down on corporate charge cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting special spending controls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tackling the £2 billion of local fraud&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;utilising £16 billion of non-school reserves creatively&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve collection rates to reduce the £2.4 billion of uncollected Council Tax across England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;encourage direct debit and e-billing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve property management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;close subsidised council canteens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reducing senior pay and posts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cut spending on consultants and agency staff which had risen to £4.5 billion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stop translating documents into foreign languages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cut expensive travel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduce printing costs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hire out the town hall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/50-ways-to-save-examples-of-sensible-savings-in-local-government"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; for the full list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2013 to 2014 spending power calculation includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£26.07 billion start up funding assessment (which includes £10.9 billion of locally retained business rates)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£23.9 billion in Council Tax&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£859 million for NHS funding to support social care&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£661 million via New Homes Bonus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£240 million for 2013 to 2014 Council Tax freeze grant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition local authorities will also benefit from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£112 million via the Weekly Collection Support Scheme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£33.5 million via New Burdens for Council Tax Support in 2013 to 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending power:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/spending-power-by-local-authority"&gt;Spending power data by local authority for 2013 to 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No authority will see a spending power reduction of more than 8.8% because of decisions taken by ministers to make an efficiency support grant available. The ‘per household’ figures are calculated using total spending power a combination of the new start up funding assessment and Council Tax, and the number of dwellings by Council Tax band for each administrative area in England. The counts are calculated from data for England extracted from the Valuation Office Agency’s database on 12 September 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-rates-retention-and-the-local-government-finance-settlement-a-plain-english-guide"&gt;plain English guide&lt;/a&gt; to cut through Whitehall jargon and explain the new settlement system is also available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will now be a period of statutory consultation on the settlement which runs to 15 January 2013. Ministers will then finalise their proposals and the settlement for 2013 to 2014 will be debated in Parliament in February in time for councils to set their budgets for next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coalition Agreement committed the government to relinquishing control over excessive Council Tax increases and giving that democratic power directly to local communities. This was legislated for through the Localism Act. The government has today published the Council Tax principles it is proposing for 2013 to 2014. Council Tax increases would trigger a referendum, if they exceed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2% for most principal authorities; or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£5 (which ever is higher) in the case of shire district councils, police and crime commissioners and fire and rescue authorities that set the lowest quartile of Council Tax in their class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final principles for 2013 to 2014 will be set out in a report for the approval of the House of Commons early next year, at the same time as the final report on the local government finance settlement. No equivalent principles are being proposed for town and parish councils for 2013 to 2014, although they may in future years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical data for the 2013-14 Local Government Finance Settlement can be found on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.local.odpm.gov.uk/finance/1314/settle.htm"&gt;Local Government Finance site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire and rescue authorities have been protected with savings back loaded to allow time for sensible savings; they have also benefited from the protection to local government in 2013 to 2014. In addition the outgoing Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser, Sir Ken Knight, has been asked to carry out a review to pinpoint ways to help fire and rescue authorities save money. The government intends to announce the breakdown of £140 million of capital grant money to fire and rescue authorities. The money for 2013 to 2015 will be distributed by a combination of formula and for projects to fire and rescue authorities that have been successful through bidding. All fire and rescue authorities will receive some capital funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Local government finance settlement oral statement</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>This oral statement is about finance for English local authorities for 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With permission Mr Speaker, I should like to make a statement on finance for English local authorities for 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Autumn Statement sets out how the coalition government is putting our public finances back on track [political content removed].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local government has shown great skill in reducing its budgets. Committed local authorities have protected front line services. Little wonder then that at a time of retrenchment satisfaction in council services has gone up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s settlement will see council expenditure fall in a controlled way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English local government accounts for £1 of every £4 spent on public services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It spends £114 billion - that’s twice the defence budget and more than the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this settlement recognises the responsibility of local government to find sensible savings and make better use of its resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It marks a new settlement for local government based on self determination and financial independence. A move from the begging bowl to pride in locality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begins the biggest shake up of local finance in a generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are shifting power from Whitehall direct to the town hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From April, authorities will directly retain nearly £11 billion of business rates instead of returning them to the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striving councils will benefit by doing the right thing by their communities. If they bring in jobs and business they will be rewarded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, New Homes Bonus remunerates councils for building more homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year the Bonus will be worth more than £650 million and even more in 2014 to 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under our reforms an estimated 70% of local authority income will be raised locally compared to a little over half under the current formula grant system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A giant step for localism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start-up funding assessment, which gives each council a share of the funding - confirmed in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement - will see £26 billion shared between councils across the country - with the smallest reductions for councils most reliant on government funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted local authorities on our proposals over the summer. And we’ve listened to what they told us. They told us that there should be less money held back from the settlement. So we’ve reduced the amounts that we are setting aside for New Homes Bonus, for the safety net and for academies funding. In total that means an additional £1.9 billion for local authorities upfront in 2013 to 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities also told us that they wanted a stronger growth incentive. We were happy to respond. So we’ve made the scheme more generous, ensuring that at least 25 pence in every pound of business rate growth will be retained locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The settlement leaves councils with considerable total spending power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall reduction in spending power next year is just 1.7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small number of authorities will require larger savings to be made but no councils face a loss of more than 8.8% in their spending power thanks to a new efficiency support grant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, to qualify councils will have to improve services to qualify. It is unfair on the rest of local government to expect them to subsidise other councils’ failure to embrace modernity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this settlement is not about what councils can take. It’s about what they can make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the settlement continues protecting fire and rescue as a blue light emergency service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we have announced £140 million of capital grant money to fire authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictably the doom mongers have been consulting their Mayan calendars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issuing dire warnings of the end of the world as we know it on Friday. A billion pound black hole in the local budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have shamefully predicted riots on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nostradamus needn’t worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because all those Malthusian predictions have come to naught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns that the poorest councils or those in the north would suffer disproportionately are well wide of the mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spending power for places is in the north compares well to those in the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Newcastle has a spending power per household of £2,522 which is over £700 more than the £1,814 per household in Wokingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also maintained the system of ‘damping’ - where government sets a ‘floor’ below which council funding will not fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s average grant reduction for the most dependent upper tier authorities will be less than 3%, compared to 8.7% for the wealthiest. That’s more support and protection than last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also confirm today that local authorities will be able to use the receipts from assets sales raised from 2012 to 2013 onwards to fund outstanding equal pay claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of what I’ve announced today, the Secretary of State for Health will in due course be confirming public health funding for local councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his Autumn Statement the Chancellor recognised the sector has risen to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why, unlike most of central government, local government was exempted from the 1% top slice next year - worth approximately £240 million to councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as it looks to 2014 and beyond, local government needs to continue finding better, more efficient, ways of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains scope for sensible savings. With the exception of a handful of authorities, nobody has got to grips with procurement. More can also be done to share offices, share services, cut fraud and provide more for less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also asked the outgoing Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser, Sir Ken Knight, to pinpoint practical ways to help fire and rescue authorities save money and protect the quality and breadth of frontline fire services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is disappointing that the Shadow Fire Minister has signalled his opposition. It has been noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker, and today, true to my Yorkshire roots, I’ve published 50 ways to save, setting out practical ways for councils to save money, big and small. But it all adds up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if councils merged their back offices like the Tri-Borough initiative in London, they could save £2 billion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;procurement fraud costs taxpayers almost a billion a year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;councils are sitting on £16 billion of reserves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;councils aren’t collecting over £2 billion of council tax&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;better property management could save £7 billion a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have also announced today that further savings will be made by the abolition of pensions for councillors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councillors should be champions of the people, not the salaried staff of the town hall state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s guide gives more power to the elbow and the public to challenge crude cuts and champion sensible savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year’s exemption will give local authorities time to put their house in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s remind ourselves what this is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;safeguarding vital public services &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;protecting families and pensioners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ending the something for nothing culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why, despite financial pressures, we will continue supporting for the third year running, those who insulate residents from further council tax hikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have set aside an extra £550 million for local authorities to support council tax: £450 million over the next 2 years for the freeze and an additional £100 million for council tax support will be available in new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All councils have a moral duty to freeze council tax.
It doubled under Labour. It became unsustainable. 
We’ve cut it in real terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear this years freeze grant goes into base for the spending review period and has the same status as every other item in base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who would prefer to carry on with increases and see residents miss out should be ready to answer to their local taxpayers and not dodge them by setting the increase just below the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For next year we have set the referendum threshold at 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also introduce a flexibility to support small district, police and fire authorities that have kept council tax low for years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Rt Hon friend the Local Government Minister has set out the details in a Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is democracy in action: if you want to hike taxes, put it to the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would contrast the action we have taken to freeze council tax with the new housing tax being introduced in the Republic of Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tackling the deficit helps keep taxes down.
If you deny the deficit, taxes on everyday families will rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker, to those who want to play the politics of division - let me say this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fair settlement - fair to north and south, rural and urban, shire and metropolitan England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this settlement is also a watershed moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in a generation, striving councils now have licence to go full steam ahead and grab a share of the wealth for their local areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stand tall, and seize the opportunities of enterprise, growth and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commend this statement to the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Local government pension scheme</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>This is a written ministerial statement about the abolition of taxpayer-funded pensions for councillors from April 2014.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 12 September 2001, the then Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions announced plans to give taxpayer-funded pensions to councillors, through access to the local government pension scheme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals came into force in 2003. The Councillors’ Commission report of the last administration noted that 912 councillors in England had joined that pension scheme by 2004. A Taxpayers’ Alliance survey in February 2009, across the whole United Kingdom, found that 3,527 councillors had pensions as of 2007 to 2008; a further survey in January 2012 found that figure had increased to 4,548 councillors by 2010 to 2011. The trend is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="abolition-of-taxpayer-funded-pensions"&gt;Abolition of taxpayer-funded pensions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers in this government take a fundamentally different view to the last administration. We do not believe that taxpayer-funded pensions are justified. Councillors are volunteers undertaking public service; they are not and should not be employees of the council dependent on the municipal payroll. They are not professional, full-time politicians, nor should they be encouraged to become so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councillors do not receive a salary; rather, they receive allowances to compensate for their out-of-pocket expenses. Yet following changes made by the last administration, allowances have slowly become a form of salary, a situation worsened by the state-funded pensions. This is a corrosive influence on local democracy and independent thought, blurring the distinction between council staff and councillors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every bit of the public sector needs to do its bit to help pay off the deficit inherited from the last administration. Local government grants are being reduced. Ministers have cut and then frozen their salaries. Public sector pensions, including parliamentary pensions, are being reformed to reduce the burden on taxpayers. It is only right that councillors do their bit as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not believe that an occupational pension scheme intended for employees, and paid for by taxpayers, is an appropriate vehicle for councillors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="existing-pension-rights"&gt;Existing pension rights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subject to consultation, we propose that there will be no access for councillors to the local government pension scheme in England from April 2014. In the interests of fairness, those councillors already in the scheme would have their accrued rights up to April 2014 fully protected, but would not be able to accrue any further benefits after that date in the existing scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not prevent councillors contributing to a personal pension: if they put aside part of their (taxable) allowances into such a pension, then that is a matter for them; they will continue to receive income tax relief like any ordinary member of the population, subject to the prevailing tax rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although central records on councillors’ participation in the scheme are not held by my department, initial rough estimates suggest that this could save £7 million a year in taxpayers’ money. There is absolutely no case for increasing councillor allowances to compensate. Instead, councils may want to consider earlier, voluntary closure of the scheme to their councillors as a sensible saving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="civic-duty"&gt;Civic duty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eligibility regulations for the local government pension scheme are overseen by my department. Although this is a centrally mandated change (as was its original introduction), we believe these reforms will assist localism and local democracy by encouraging a greater separation between councillors and officers. Robust local scrutiny of council spending requires councillors to be substantively independent of means and of thought from the body they are overseeing. Civic duty should not be bought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not believe it will have any detrimental effect on people choosing to become councillors. The best thing we can do to encourage more people to take part in municipal public life is to decentralise power to local communities so being a councillor is a meaningful and rewarding role. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="elected-mayors"&gt;Elected mayors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognise that there is a greater expectation that an elected mayor is a full-time position. We therefore propose to consult on allowing elected mayors to remain in the scheme as a voluntary option (but not as an expectation), subject to local scrutiny, challenge and determination. The salaries of the mayor of London, members of the Greater London Assembly and police and crime commissioners will remain pensionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="timing"&gt;Timing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statutory consultation is required and will commence in due course, as part of the planned consultation on the wider reform of the local government pension scheme. We will consult with the Welsh Assembly government in respect of access to the local government pension scheme for councillors in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a former councillor myself, I would like to pay tribute to their often unsung and ongoing work in standing up for their local residents. We hope these reforms will further strengthen the integrity and independence of councillors and increase the respect within their communities for the voluntary work they undertake as champions of the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>This draft statutory instrument affects the upratings of default schemes and pension credit age schemes. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 7 September 2012, the Department for Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;) confirmed its intention to update and align the premia/ applicable amounts in regulations for the default and pensioner schemes with current rates/ Department for Work and Pensions’ (&lt;abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions"&gt;DWP&lt;/abbr&gt;) autumn uprating. This would be done using Housing Benefit amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; said it would be working with &lt;abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions"&gt;DWP&lt;/abbr&gt; (again, in relation to the pension credit age and default schemes) to model the way in which non-dependent deductions would have been uprated had council tax benefit continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This draft statutory instrument effects these upratings and is being published ahead of the regulations being made, to give authorities early notice of the changes required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister praises local government efforts to tackle fraud </title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Local Government Minister Baroness Hanham welcomes the ‘Fighting Fraud Locally’ end of year review.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is essential for local government to take action to tackle fraud in every possible way and therefore help prevent the current loss of £2 billion of taxpayers’ money, Baroness Hanham said in a keynote address on 6 December 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remarks came as the review on the local government’s ‘Fighting Fraud locally’ report was launched at the annual Fighting Fraud Locally conference, which highlighted the progress made by councils in 2012 in reducing the risks they face. Fraud costs every adult in the country about £1,140 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event, attended by over 200 local authority members, the minister said councils needed to assess whether they had sufficient controls in place to prevent fraud happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister praised the action already taken by most councils to tackle fraud and encouraged them all to follow the lead set by the &lt;abbr title="Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith and Fulham"&gt;west London tri-borough authorities&lt;/abbr&gt;, in particular in the investigation of tenancy fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baroness Hanham said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fraud costs this country more than £73 billion a year, over £2 billion of which is lost to local government. This is a complete waste of taxpayers money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is essential councils do everything they can to not only prevent fraud, but recover lost money and pursue fraudsters in court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The approaches recommended in the local government’s ‘Fighting Fraud Locally’ report sets out how to tackle local fraud through better detection and fraud recovery. Councils cannot afford to have resources meant for vulnerable people and front line services being stolen by fraudsters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is helping create an environment where councils can tackle tenancy fraud, in particular through a series of measures including: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through the provisions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/preventionofsocialhousingfraud.html"&gt;Prevention of Social Housing Fraud Bill&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leading on the request in &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/nfa/fighting-fraud-locally-strategy/"&gt;Fighting Fraud Locally&lt;/a&gt; for central government to enable there to be greater information sharing to identify fraud and fraudsters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area--2/supporting-pages/localising-council-tax-support"&gt;localising council tax support&lt;/a&gt;, which will give councils a strong incentive to reduce fraud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest survey of fraud against local bodies can be found in the Audit Commission’s report, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/fraud/protecting-the-public-purse/Pages/protecting-the-public-purse-2012.aspx"&gt;Protecting the Public Purse 2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
