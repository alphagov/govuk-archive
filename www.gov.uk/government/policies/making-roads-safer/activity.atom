    <title>Tough new measures to tackle drink drivers</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A package of tough measures to crack down on drink drivers has been unveiled today by Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included in the proposals are plans to remove the statutory right to a replacement blood or urine test where a breath test reading is above and close to the legal limit, closing the loophole which allows those testing positive in breath to sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also intends to legislate to allow police the option not to perform a preliminary breath test where roadside evidential breath tests are carried out following the rollout of roadside evidential breath testing devices and give registered health care professionals greater roles in testing drink drivers - both of which options would speed up the enforcement process and deal with more drink drivers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have made great progress in tackling drink drivers and the 2011 fatality figure for drink and drive accidents is the second lowest ever recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, last year 280 people died ruining the lives of families up and down the country so more needs to be done to eradicate this menace. That is why we are taking forward a package of measures to streamline enforcement against drink driving.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am determined to make the jobs of those who deal with drink drivers easier and less bureaucratic so that bringing offenders to justice is not left to chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, drivers who record less than 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath have the right to demand a blood or urine test - despite being over the legal limit of 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres. This is known as the statutory option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option dates back to the original introduction of breathalyser technology when there were concerns over reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his review of drink and drug driving Sir Peter North recommended the removal of the right to demand a blood or urine test as evidence showed people were using it as a delaying tactic. The government also believes that improvements in the accuracy of technology means that this option is no longer necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/government/consultations/enforcement-procedures-against-drink-drivers-and-other-offenders"&gt;consultation also seeks views&lt;/a&gt; on removing the requirement for a preliminary breath test where roadside evidential breath testing is used. At the moment, when a suspected drink driver is pulled over by police, they undergo a preliminary breath test and are then taken to a police station for a further evidential test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from the evidential test taken at police stations are the only ones used as evidence. Under the new plans, following the introduction of mobile evidential testing devices the police could perform the eventual test at the roadside so the preliminary test would not be required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also want to see a wider range of registered healthcare professionals given the power to take evidential blood samples in hospitals and to assess whether a driver may have a condition due to a drug. This will enable tests to be carried out more swiftly, easing the pressure on doctors who are currently the only professionals with the authority to carry out the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other proposals within the plans include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commissioning further research into the current process used to decide whether a driver banned due to drink driving can regain their licence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;further exploration of how greater use can be made of vehicle forfeiture powers to get the most dangerous and irresponsible motorists off the road, including drink drivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation encompasses the legislative changes the Government proposed in its response of March 2011 to the reports by Sir Peter North and the Transport Select Committee on drink and drug driving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation period runs until 2 January 2013&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Enforcement procedures against drink drivers and other offenders</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation encompasses the legislative changes the government proposed in its response of March 2011 to the reports by Sir Peter North and the Transport Select Committee on drink and drug driving (“the Government’s response”). The changes covered in this consultation do not, however, include creating a new offence related to driving with a specified impairing drug in the body, which is also being progressed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed legislative changes relate to Great Britain (and not to Northern Ireland) and will be implemented subject to the outcome of this consultation and the securing of legislative time. The proposals are consistent with the devolution of the drink drive limit in Scotland, through the Scotland Act 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation seeks views about proceeding with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the withdrawal of the ‘statutory option’;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes as to when preliminary breath tests are needed;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes to the testing procedures in hospital;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes to who can assess whether someone is under the influence of drugs; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;amendments to the regimes for aviation, rail and shipping which mirror the road regime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Consultation on changes to enforcement procedures for drink driving offences</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has today &lt;a href="/government/consultations/enforcement-procedures-against-drink-drivers-and-other-offenders"&gt;launched a consultation on some enforcement issues relating to the current legislation on drink and drug driving&lt;/a&gt;.  This consultation encompasses the legislative changes the government proposed in its response of March 2011 to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100921035225/http://northreview.independent.gov.uk/docs/NorthReview-Report.pdf"&gt;reports by Sir Peter North&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmtran/460/46002.htm"&gt;Transport Select Committee&lt;/a&gt; on drink and drug driving (“&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm80/8050/8050.pdf"&gt;the Government’s response&lt;/a&gt;” ).  The changes covered in this consultation should not be confused with the legislation related to driving with a specified impairing drug in the body, which is currently passing through Parliament in the Crime and Courts Bill.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation on enforcement of drink driving will cover four potential legislative changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) withdrawal of the right people have to replace their breath alcohol specimens with either a specimen of blood or specimens of urine in cases where the lower of the two breath readings provided does not exceed 50 microgrammes (mcg) of alcohol per 100 millilitres (ml) of  breath (known commonly as the ‘statutory option’).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) removing the requirement for preliminary testing where evidential testing is undertaken away from a police station.  This would mean that a preliminary breath test would not to have to be taken in addition to two evidential breath tests, when mobile evidential breath testing devices are used away from a police station.  While such devices are not yet available, it is expected that they may be type approved within the next 2 years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) streamlining the procedure for testing drink drivers and drug impaired drivers in hospital so that a wider range of registered healthcare professionals are allowed to take evidential blood specimens.  This would make it consistent with other policing provisions.
4) the consultation asks for views on whether a health care professional other than a doctor should be able to assess whether a driver may be under the influence of a drug prior to evidential testing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislative changes proposed in this consultation would apply to the Road Traffic Act 1988.  Subject to the outcome of the consultation, we intend to legislate as soon as Parliamentary time allows on the matters covered in points 1-4 above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-proposals-in-the-consultation"&gt;Other proposals in the consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Road Traffic Act 1998 (and other parallel legislative provisions) apply similar measures to the drink drive offence to railways, shipping and aviation.  The consultation seeks views about whether any changes here should also apply to these other transport sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation explores how further use can be made of vehicle forfeiture powers to get the most dangerous and irresponsible motorists off the road including those who drive while under the influence of alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation document explores the scope for further research into the processes for reassessing whether a driver banned due to drink driving should regain their licence. The research would develop the evidence base for longer term solutions in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation seeks views about the way forward on three as yet un-commenced legislative provisions in the Road Safety Act 2006 relating to the training and punishment of certain road traffic offenders.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with the revised guidance on consultations, we propose to shorten the consultation time for this to just over 5 weeks.  We are particularly interested in the views of the healthcare sector on points 3 and 4 and are planning to meet representative bodies for medical professionals in early December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Correction to the written answer to Parliamentary Question 97198</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I regret to inform the House that there was an inaccuracy in the answer given by the then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State to Parliamentary Question 97198 on 1 March (Official Report, Column 450W) about Driving: Licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; identifies poor performing MOT testing stations through a transparent and proportionate disciplinary points system published in the MOT Testing Guide. &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; cessate individual testers called Authorised Examiners (AEs) from carrying out MOT tests, not the test stations. AEs cessated in the last three years are 111 in 2008-09, 90 in 2009-10, and 89 in 2010-11 all after appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; identifies poor performing MOT testing stations through a transparent and proportionate disciplinary points system published in the MOT Testing Guide. &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; can take action against Authorised Examiners (AEs) and Nominated Testers (NTs).  AEs are an individual, partnership or company approved to carry out MOT tests.  NTs carry out the actual tests.  In the last three years, the Agency struck off 111 AEs in 08/09, 90 in 09/10, and 89 in 10/11, all after appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Driving examiner strike on 30 November: candidates urged to attend tests</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving examiners who are members of the Public and Commercial Services (&lt;abbr title="Public and Commercial Services"&gt;PCS&lt;/abbr&gt;) union could take strike action on Friday 30 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) Chief Executive Rosemary Thew said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not all examiners are members of the &lt;abbr title="Public and Commercial Services"&gt;PCS&lt;/abbr&gt; union. Even if they are, we can’t be sure that they’ll support the strike. So we’re asking you to come for your test so it can go ahead if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re sorry for the inconvenience this will cause. We’ll do everything we can to minimise disruption for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t have to contact &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; to rebook if you can’t take your test because of the strike action. You should hear from the agency with a new date within 5 to 10 working days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="out-of-pocket-expenses"&gt;Out-of-pocket expenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can claim out-of-pocket expenses if your test is cancelled, but you must have turned up for your test to do this. You’ll have to rebook your own test and you won’t be able to claim expenses if you don’t turn up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/practical-driving-test-for-cars/cancelled-or-stopped-tests-and-bad-weather" title="Claiming out-of-pocket expenses"&gt;Find out how to claim out-of-pocket expenses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="customer-service-centre"&gt;Customer service centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s customer service centre for practical driving tests might also be affected by strike action on Friday 30 November. You’ll still be able to &lt;a href="/browse/driving/learning-to-drive" title="Book, change or cancel practical driving tests"&gt;book, change or cancel practical driving tests&lt;/a&gt; online on GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="theory-tests"&gt;Theory tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theory tests aren’t affected by the strike action and will be taking place as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
