    <title>Driving examiner strike on 30 November: candidates urged to attend tests</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving examiners who are members of the Public and Commercial Services (&lt;abbr title="Public and Commercial Services"&gt;PCS&lt;/abbr&gt;) union could take strike action on Friday 30 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) Chief Executive Rosemary Thew said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not all examiners are members of the &lt;abbr title="Public and Commercial Services"&gt;PCS&lt;/abbr&gt; union. Even if they are, we can’t be sure that they’ll support the strike. So we’re asking you to come for your test so it can go ahead if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re sorry for the inconvenience this will cause. We’ll do everything we can to minimise disruption for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t have to contact &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; to rebook if you can’t take your test because of the strike action. You should hear from the agency with a new date within 5 to 10 working days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="out-of-pocket-expenses"&gt;Out-of-pocket expenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can claim out-of-pocket expenses if your test is cancelled, but you must have turned up for your test to do this. You’ll have to rebook your own test and you won’t be able to claim expenses if you don’t turn up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/practical-driving-test-for-cars/cancelled-or-stopped-tests-and-bad-weather" title="Claiming out-of-pocket expenses"&gt;Find out how to claim out-of-pocket expenses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="customer-service-centre"&gt;Customer service centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s customer service centre for practical driving tests might also be affected by strike action on Friday 30 November. You’ll still be able to &lt;a href="/browse/driving/learning-to-drive" title="Book, change or cancel practical driving tests"&gt;book, change or cancel practical driving tests&lt;/a&gt; online on GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="theory-tests"&gt;Theory tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theory tests aren’t affected by the strike action and will be taking place as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) statistics</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="about-these-statistics"&gt;About these statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These operational statistics about Driver Certificate of Professional (&lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt;) modules and training have not been designated as an official statistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics come from data held by the Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;), and are compiled and published by staff in &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="information-you-cannot-find"&gt;Information you cannot find&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cannot find the information you need, it may have been:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;published in &lt;a href="/government/publications?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;topics%5B%5D=all&amp;amp;departments%5B%5D=driving-standards-agency&amp;amp;publication_type=foi-releases" title="Responses to FOI requests"&gt;response to an Freedom of Information (&lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt;) request&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;designated as an &lt;a href="/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/driving-tests-and-instructors-statistics" title="Official driving test statistics"&gt;official statistic&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.dft.gov.uk/foi/form/" title="Send an FOI request"&gt;send an &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; request&lt;/a&gt; if you still cannot find the information you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="information-that-cannot-be-released"&gt;Information that cannot be released&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; cannot send you information if it is part of an official statistic that has not yet been published. This is because the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/2998/contents/made" title="Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008"&gt;Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008&lt;/a&gt; limits access to official statistics until they are published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="downloads"&gt;Downloads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These older statistics are available from the The National Archives:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency 13 November 2012</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt;) has recently run a competition to procure a front office counter service provider for its face to face motoring services from next April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can today announce that &lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt; will award Post Office Ltd® a contract to build on the existing counter operation to provide a wider range of services and better accessibility for motorists. The contract will run for 7 years with an option to extend for up to another 3 years. This contract will allow the Post Office to fully develop better services with the requirements of customers at the heart. Under the contract Post Office Ltd® will offer &lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt; services at over 4,700 outlets for road tax and vehicle transactions, 750 of which will also cater for driver licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new contract provides value for money for the taxpayer resulting in savings of between £13 million and £15 million a year. The contract also gives scope for the Post Office to provide front office counter services for other government departments, to increase efficiencies across government and provide better value for the tax payer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Plans unveiled to increase lorry speeds to boost growth</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans to increase the speed limit for some heavy goods vehicles (&lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt;) in a bid to boost economic growth have been announced today by Roads Minister Stephen Hammond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current speed limit on single carriageways for &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; over 7.5 tonnes is 40 mph. Under the proposals, this could be increased to 45 mph or 50 mph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freight industry say this will help growth by improving journey times, cutting congestion and reducing costs to business and the cost of goods people buy. It could also reduce the number of collisions caused by other road users overtaking slower moving lorries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roads Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The government is committed to doing everything it can to improve conditions for economic growth. We are consulting on increasing the single carriage way speed limit for certain &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; after listening to industry experts who say that this will boost the UK economy and businesses of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While this is likely to lead to more than £30 million a year in benefits for businesses through quicker journeys and reduced congestion, I want to make sure we have carefully considered the evidence of all of the effects on the economy, environment and – of course – road safety before we make a decision. I welcome views from all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; statistics on monitored free-flow roads estimate that around 70% of &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; currently travel over 40 mph and it is argued that these &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; have an unfair competitive advantage over those who stick to the speed limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed limit for smaller &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; (those between 3.5 tonnes and 7.5 tonnes) is 50 mph. This will remain unchanged. This consultation does not cover any other speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of the consultation follows a commitment published in ‘The logistics growth review’ in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 1 February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation is now available on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-34"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Department for Transport estimates that around 280,000 &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; would be impacted by the changes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The maximum speed limit for the road on single carriageways is 60 mph, (unless a local speed limit is in force)&lt;/li&gt;
