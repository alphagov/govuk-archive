    <title>Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency 13 November 2012</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt;) has recently run a competition to procure a front office counter service provider for its face to face motoring services from next April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can today announce that &lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt; will award Post Office Ltd® a contract to build on the existing counter operation to provide a wider range of services and better accessibility for motorists. The contract will run for 7 years with an option to extend for up to another 3 years. This contract will allow the Post Office to fully develop better services with the requirements of customers at the heart. Under the contract Post Office Ltd® will offer &lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt; services at over 4,700 outlets for road tax and vehicle transactions, 750 of which will also cater for driver licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new contract provides value for money for the taxpayer resulting in savings of between £13 million and £15 million a year. The contract also gives scope for the Post Office to provide front office counter services for other government departments, to increase efficiencies across government and provide better value for the tax payer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Plans unveiled to increase lorry speeds to boost growth</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans to increase the speed limit for some heavy goods vehicles (&lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt;) in a bid to boost economic growth have been announced today by Roads Minister Stephen Hammond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current speed limit on single carriageways for &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; over 7.5 tonnes is 40 mph. Under the proposals, this could be increased to 45 mph or 50 mph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freight industry say this will help growth by improving journey times, cutting congestion and reducing costs to business and the cost of goods people buy. It could also reduce the number of collisions caused by other road users overtaking slower moving lorries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roads Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The government is committed to doing everything it can to improve conditions for economic growth. We are consulting on increasing the single carriage way speed limit for certain &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; after listening to industry experts who say that this will boost the UK economy and businesses of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While this is likely to lead to more than £30 million a year in benefits for businesses through quicker journeys and reduced congestion, I want to make sure we have carefully considered the evidence of all of the effects on the economy, environment and – of course – road safety before we make a decision. I welcome views from all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; statistics on monitored free-flow roads estimate that around 70% of &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; currently travel over 40 mph and it is argued that these &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; have an unfair competitive advantage over those who stick to the speed limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed limit for smaller &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; (those between 3.5 tonnes and 7.5 tonnes) is 50 mph. This will remain unchanged. This consultation does not cover any other speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of the consultation follows a commitment published in ‘The logistics growth review’ in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 1 February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation is now available on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-34"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Department for Transport estimates that around 280,000 &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; would be impacted by the changes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The maximum speed limit for the road on single carriageways is 60 mph, (unless a local speed limit is in force)&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Examining the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes on single carriageway roads</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum speed limit for heavy goods vehicles (&lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt;) over 7.5 tonnes on single carriageway roads is prescribed in Schedule 6 of the Road Traffic Act 1984. The current speed limit on single carriageways for &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; over 7.5 tonnes is 40 miles per hour. The speed limit for smaller &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; (those between 3.5 tonnes and 7.5 tonnes) is 50 mph. The government made a commitment in ‘The logistics growth review – connecting people with goods’ document published in November 2011, to consult on this issue during 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders have said that the 40 mph speed limit causes unnecessary cost to vehicle operators, congestion, avoidable overtaking accidents and creates an uneven playing field for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freight and logistics sector is an essential part of the economy, vital to businesses of all sizes and sectors. Raising &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; speed limits on single carriageway roads could lead to quicker journeys and lower costs for the sector, aiding economic growth as well as reducing frustration for the many drivers who find themselves stuck behind slower-moving lorries on busy roads unable to overtake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are other consequences of greater speed – both in terms of the environmental impacts and the potential effects on road safety. The department wants to make sure we have carefully considered the evidence of all of the effects on the economy, environment and road safety before any decision is made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Highway Code campaign wins top award</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign, run by the Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) in partnership with its official publisher The Stationery Office (&lt;abbr title="The Stationery Office"&gt;TSO&lt;/abbr&gt;), has helped transform The Highway Code from a simple book into a multi-platform road safety service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign started in December 2011 with the launch of The Highway Code on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.twitter.com/HighwayCodeGB" title="The Highway Code on Twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.facebook.com/HighwayCodeGB" title="The Highway Code on Facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, providing daily reminders of the rules of the road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was followed by the launch of digital editions of The Highway Code, including e-books and an official &lt;a rel="external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/official-highway-code/id522687241?mt=8" title="The Highway Code official iPhone app"&gt;iPhone app.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new formats help to make sure that all road users – not just learner drivers – know The Highway Code and stay up to date with the rules of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister, Stephen Hammond, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am very pleased that our work to promote The Highway Code has been recognised with a Prince Michael International Road Safety Award. The Highway Code is the official guide to using the roads safely and responsibly and has been helping to save lives for more than 80 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It holds crucial information for everyone from experienced motorists and motorcyclists to horse riders and pedestrians. By keeping up with the times and embracing modern technology, The Highway Code is now more accessible than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="The Stationery Office"&gt;TSO&lt;/abbr&gt; Chief Executive Officer, Marco Pierleoni, added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As experts in digital content management, &lt;abbr title="The Stationery Office"&gt;TSO&lt;/abbr&gt; is helping &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; to get the essential information in The Highway Code out to more people than ever before. We’ve expanded the number of high quality, multimedia formats that The Highway Code is available in, making it easy for all road users to access it in the way that they want, on the devices that they use every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Highway Code is for life - not just for learners - and these new, innovative formats are helping people to refresh their knowledge years after they’ve passed their tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.roadsafetyawards.com" title="Prince Michael International Road Safety Awards"&gt;Prince Michael International Road Safety Awards&lt;/a&gt; recognise achievements and innovations which will improve road safety. Each year the most outstanding examples of international road safety initiatives are given public recognition through the scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
