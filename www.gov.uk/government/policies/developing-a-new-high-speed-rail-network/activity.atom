    <title>Full speed ahead as government appoints new Director General to oversee HS2</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>David Prout to be Director General taking charge of the delivery of HS2.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government’s commitment to delivering a new national high speed rail network has been underlined by the appointment of a new Director General to oversee the crucial project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/government/people/david-prout"&gt;David Prout&lt;/a&gt;, currently a Director General at the Department of Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;), will join the Department for Transport (DfT) in the New Year in a newly-created post taking charge of the delivery of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a national high speed rail network linking London, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, the East Midlands, with each other and cities beyond it, to drive regional growth, improve connectivity and create extra space and capacity on our railways and roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his current role, David Prout has been at &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; since 2009, with responsibility for localism, and additional responsibility as deputy for &lt;a href="/government/people/bob-kerslake"&gt;Sir Bob Kerslake&lt;/a&gt; given the latter’s role as Head of the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/government/people/philip-rutnam"&gt;Philip Rutnam, DfT Permanent Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a hugely important programme for the future of the UK. I am very pleased that David Prout will be taking charge at such an exciting time. He will be leading a team which is already hard at work delivering this project, as well as liaising closely with &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; Ltd, as we work together to introduce the legislation into Parliament on time next year that will make &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Prout said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Making &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; a reality is absolutely crucial to our country’s future prosperity and I am very pleased to have been asked to take leadership of this much-needed programme at this time. I look forward to helping to take the project through Parliament and continuing to demonstrate the very real need for more capacity for people and freight on our railways, which will help make Britain a more prosperous and less congested country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to his current role at &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;, David was Executive Director for Planning and Borough Development at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Before that he was Director of Local Government Policy in the Department for Communities and Local Government.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;David has held a range of high profile civil service positions including Principal Private Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister in the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, Cabinet Office and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From 1995 to 1998 David was environment attaché at the UK Permanent Representation to the European Union in Brussels. Prior to that he held a variety of posts in the Department of the Environment. He also worked in the planning department of Westminster City Council from 1990 to 1993 and for the Victorian Society from 1991 to 1993.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Transport Scotland high speed rail summit</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Video speech by Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport Norman Baker.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2gEnT-LreI&amp;amp;feature=share&amp;amp;list=UU8mgf88hO4bbrfta9bcgZuA"&gt;Transport Scotland high speed rail summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transcript"&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello and thank you for the opportunity to put on record coalition government’s commitment to high speed rail, and its determination that all parts of our country, including of course Scotland, should benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing demand for inter-city rail travel is putting increasing pressure on existing infrastructure. Without planning for additional capacity, passengers face the prospect of increasingly crowded and more unreliable services. To be clear, the primary, though not the only, justification for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a clear need for extra capacity north to south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans for a high speed rail network from London to the West Midlands and on to Leeds and Manchester will be the backbone of a new transport system for the 21st century.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2026, Phase 1 of High Speed 2 will link London and Birmingham. Comfortable trains travelling at 225 miles per hour will cut the journey time to just 45 minutes, compared to the 84 minutes it currently takes. Importantly for Scotland, the first phase of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will provide connections to the existing network at Birmingham, and also link &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; to &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt;, opening up the opportunities for through trains to run from Scotland to Paris and Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completion of the Y network to Leeds and Manchester will further spread the benefits of high speed rail across the country, increasing capacity and enhancing connectivity all the way to Scotland by relieving pressure on the most congested southern end of the line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition agreement makes it clear that our ultimate goal is a genuinely national network, with high speed services from London to the Midlands and the north, including Scotland. We see phases one and two of the High Speed 2 project as the best way to make progress towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport ministerial team is very much engaged in the question of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; as it affects and, indeed, benefits Scotland. I visited Glasgow last year, the former Secretary of State went in March this year, and the current Secretary of State intends to visit later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last month we announced the launch of a study on ways to get fast journeys further north and to Scotland, making sure that the north-east benefits too. The aim is to fully understand and articulate transport needs in Scotland and the north of England, setting out the remit for any future work, using completion of the ‘Y’ network as a starting point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study won’t start with any preconceptions but will be open to all options that offer good value for money to the taxpayer. This may include a full high speed solution, upgrades to existing infrastructure, or a combination of the two.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands today the network is expected to deliver up to £50 billion of business benefits alone and that will be felt very much in Scotland and the north of England as well as the South. The claim by some opponents of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; that better and faster transport links between north and south will see economic activity pulled into London and away from the UK’s other great cities is defeatist and misguided, and out of line with public opinion. The further north you go, the louder are the voices in support of high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing Edinburgh and Glasgow closer to London as well as the cities of the midlands and the north of England will undoubtedly boost growth across all of our major conurbations. That confidence is based on the evidence from our European neighbours, who began their high speed rail journey a generation before we had even started arguing about our first 67 mile stretch of high speed track from the channel tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With passengers enjoying faster journeys, there has been more extensive modal shift between rail and air as the train becomes the mode of choice for more travellers. High speed rail is already greener than flying and the gap between the two modes will widen as we make progress in decarbonising the sources of our electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will benefit every type of traveller, not just on the new network, but on existing lines too, freeing up more space and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, not only will high speed rail help boost the Scottish economy and support thousands of jobs in Scotland and throughout the UK, it gives us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the economic geography of the whole country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever way you look at it, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a national scheme in the national interest driven by a national government. Realising the full benefits of high speed rail for Scotland is crucial to the economic wellbeing of the whole country, and I can assure you we will continue to work very closely with our partners in Scotland to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Westbourne HS2 Alliance dinner</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by the Rt Hon Simon Burns MP, Minister of State for Transport.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction James (James Bethall, Westbourne Comms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough the importance of the work the Alliance does to build up a coalition of support for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We value your support for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; and we need other organisations to continue make the case for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; in a positive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your efforts are highly regarded and greatly appreciated, so it’s a genuine pleasure to be with you all this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-only-game-in-town"&gt;The only game in town&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac Singer, the Polish-American author and Noble Prize winner, once told a journalist: “We have to believe in free will. We’ve got no choice”.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s pretty much how I feel about high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I’m convinced that a high speed rail network won’t simply transform the way we travel in Britain, it will also transform the way we live, work and do business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And transform it for generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also one hundred per cent certain that opting out of a high speed future would be a disaster for Britain, a missed opportunity we’d regret for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for me, there’s only one choice that makes sense for our country’s success and our children’s future, and that’s &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is the only game in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bigger-picture"&gt;Bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; debate, we can talk about the line of route, design and technology or even mitigation measures and compensation packages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of these things matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also vital that we never ever lose sight of the bigger picture - the long-term potential of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the brief time I have tonight, that’s what Id like to focus on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="economic-potential"&gt;Economic potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;’s economic potential:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will mean faster journey times, more capacity and better connected cities and regions - which, in turn, means that British businesses will be able to use it to exploit new markets and win new customers both at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also create and support tens of thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; can help to power up the recovery and put people back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="social-potential"&gt;Social potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will help to close the decades’ long north-south divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will help to open up access to employment opportunities and essential services like education and health for millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in a very real sense, a high speed rail network is as much about delivering better life chances as it is about getting from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="environmental-potential"&gt;Environmental potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me then, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; makes economic and social sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can also see a persuasive environmental case for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because I really do believe that &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will offer people and businesses a high speed, low carbon alternative to short-haul flying and long-distance motoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="willing-to-accept-unwilling-to-postpone-determined-to-meet"&gt;Willing to accept, unwilling to postpone, determined to meet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I look at the bigger &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; picture I don’t just see an investment in a high &lt;abbr title="technology"&gt;tech&lt;/abbr&gt;, high capacity, high speed rail network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see an investment in a stronger economy, a fairer society and a cleaner and greener environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why it has my full on and flat commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that building high speed rail will be a test of Britain’s energy and skills. And yes, I know this challenge is as big as they come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also know this country - .its people and its companies, its spirit and resolve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I am absolutely convinced it’s a challenge that we in Britain are willing to accept, unwilling to postpone and determined to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="closing-remarks"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, when I first started out in politics I was told that the Golden Rule of public speaking was exhaust neither the subject nor the audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, down the years I’ve discovered another rule - never keep an audience from their dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, ahead of our dinner and discussion, it only remains for me to say thank you for listening and here’s to a night of good food and great conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Campaign to Protect Rural England - Annual Lecture - Transport and the Countryside</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by the Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin MP, Secretary of State for Transport.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great pleasure to be here with you in this extraordinary museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A place that shows us how transport built London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the world’s first underground trains in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the Routemaster bus in the 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the cablecars and Boris bikes of today.
Transport is what makes London tick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s easy to see why people sometimes think transport only matters to big cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I know – and you know – they’re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="derbyshire-dales"&gt;Derbyshire Dales&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, because I represent the Derbyshire Dales in Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe I’m the first Secretary of State for Transport with a really rural constituency since John MacGregor in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m afraid you are going to hear quite a lot about it today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derbyshire Dales is not just the most beautiful part of the Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the back garden for half the cities in England. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Derby and Nottingham - all just a short trip away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They put huge pressure on our rural transport system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But transport doesn’t just matter for visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a necessary part of country life, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The further you are from towns, services, jobs and friends, the more important transport becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why rural Britain needs good transport just as much as urban Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact it always has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at a map of stagecoach routes for Derbyshire in the eighteenth century and you’ll also be looking at a map of bus and car routes today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s another thing that’s just as evident in rural life today as it was in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take my local branch line from Derby which ends at Matlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 1968, this was a busy mainline from Derby to Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that year, Barbara Castle made the mistake of closing the route between Matlock and Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we regret that closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a century ago, when it was first built, people protested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Headstone Viaduct was built through Monsal Dale, John Ruskin said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The valley is gone! Now every fool in Buxton can be in Bakewell in half an hour. And every fool at Bakewell in Buxton.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, as now, you’ll always find people ready to question whether we need more capacity, or better links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, we did then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we do today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has happened in the intervening years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the fundamental requirements of our economy are exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need better transport to connect people with the workplace and goods with the marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s not enough to close our eyes to the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, Ruskin was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful Monsal Dale not only survived the construction of the line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was enhanced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The viaduct is now a listed structure and the old railway has become the Monsal Trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so popular even I have cycled on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s just the sort of thing I’d like to see more of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you accept that we need good transport to live our lives and expand our economy then two questions come to mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you provide it so that rural people can benefit too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how can you make sure the beauty of Britain doesn’t suffer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t easy questions to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that there are a couple of ways to look at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either you try to freeze progress, put up with what you have got already…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and condemn rural Britain to a nasty mix of stagnation and congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you can be confident, see transport as a good thing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and do what it takes to make sure that transport helps the countryside, not harms it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cars-and-community-transport"&gt;Cars and community transport&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that takes me directly to cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people, cars are rural transport – and dare I say it, that includes many &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt; members too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m not apologetic about supporting drivers, rural garages, rural roads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And rural Post Offices, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With today’s good news that the &lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s new £450 million, seven-year contract will stay with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know that running a vehicle has become more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly in rural regions where people have fewer options and tend to do higher mileages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just the cost of rural driving that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cars have a growing impact on the countryside too. Rural traffic is rising fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s affecting the tranquillity of the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I want people to be free to drive…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…I also want to protect what they come to the countryside to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means ideas like the “quiet lanes” we have in Derbyshire…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and it means making sure there are good alternatives to driving too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of rural people and visitors don’t have access to a car, or don’t want to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have got to help rural bus services, and support alternatives like community transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re keeping the Concessionary Travel Scheme which allows older and disabled people to travel for free on local bus services after the morning peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re developing a new approach to subsidising buses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re putting £600 million into the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve also increased funding to boost community transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community rail, in particular, has been a great success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rural branch lines – the lucky ones that survived Dr Beeching – have shown outstanding growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the St Ives Bay line, just over four miles long…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…to the 88-mile route along the Cumbrian Coast…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…. and my local line through Duffield to Matlock, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="road-signs"&gt;Road signs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So transport plays a fundamental role in the rural economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s something else I want to talk about today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landscape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the countryside looks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many country roads carry a reminder of how insensitive planners can be to aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugly and unnecessary signs clutter up the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New signs seem to sprout like weeds, without any apparent consideration of what’s already there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often what we’re left with is not just a blot on the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s confusing and potentially dangerous too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those ‘temporary’ signs saying “New Road Layout Ahead” that are left to rot for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or near me in Derbyshire there’s an ugly big sign by a beautiful medieval church that just says: “No Footpath”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s on a small country lane. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there isn’t a path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t need a huge sign to tell us that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m determined to do more to sort this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a traffic signs review in 2011, and we’ve relaxed rules that used to insist on two signs by the road side when one would do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re working on revised Traffic Signs Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combined effect of these changes will be to give authorities and designers much greater freedom to simplify and use fewer signs at country junctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to make sure that they use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my message today to highways engineers is: if in doubt, don’t do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save your money for something that really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="road-safety"&gt;Road safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something, for instance, like road safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, around two-thirds of fatal traffic accidents happened on rural roads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re looking at ways to give councils a greater say over speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, creating 40 &lt;abbr title="miles per hour"&gt;mph&lt;/abbr&gt; zones in national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful to the &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt; for responding to the consultation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ll issue guidance by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="hs2-and-the-countryside"&gt;HS2 and the countryside&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve spoken about some of the immediate challenges facing rural transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also my job to prepare our country for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next 30 years, for instance, passenger demand for rail is set to double…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…while vehicle traffic will rise rapidly too, especially outside cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a country, we are travelling more and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet many of our roads and railways are already overcrowded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a railway system conceived in the 19th century straining to support a 21st century economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I want to get cracking on High Speed Two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just to get faster journeys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to free up space on the rest of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get freight onto rail, and trucks off our roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know it’s controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people here today will oppose the line strongly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I respect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also want you to hear the case for going ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My argument today is that we need good transport and more of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question is how we provide it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think HS2 is the right way to do it for our countryside as well as our cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High speed, high capacity stations in city centres will encourage new housing and business on brownfield sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means fewer big new roads through the countryside and less urban and suburban sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt;’s vision for 2026 makes clear, the sustainable cities will preserve and energise rural England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put it another way: a better Manchester and a better Sheffield can also mean a better Peak District.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our objective with HS2 is not just to make sure it isn’t just the south-east that benefits from growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also to deliver it in the most responsible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, what’s good for the economy and what’s good for the environment have been seen as polar opposites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s assumed you have to make a straight choice between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also an attitude that favours division over dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I reject that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I welcome the &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt;’s constructive – but challenging – input to High Speed Two. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start, we have sought to consider the views of rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their evidence was carefully weighed up after one of the largest public consultations ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a result, we announced alterations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than half the route between London and Birmingham will now be in tunnels or cuttings…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Including a longer, continuous tunnel under the Chilterns from Little Missenden to the M25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 13 miles through the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty, less than 2 miles will be at or above the surface. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means less impact on ancient woodlands and heritage sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is still a lot to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So HS2 Ltd will keep working hard with you and others as the scheme develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we consult on the best route for HS2 north of Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="design-and-compensation"&gt;Design and compensation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m particularly keen to ensure high quality design for structures along the route &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ones that are sensitive to the character of their setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can confirm today that I have asked HS2 Ltd to look at establishing an independent HS2 Design Panel – just as we did for the Olympic Park and Crossrail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made up of experts in architecture, engineering, town planning and transport, it will work with local people, councils, environmental and countryside groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than that, those whose homes are affected will be recompensed over and above what the law requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those living closest to HS2 will be able to sell their home to the government – whether they are required for construction or not – at any time after the route is safeguarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will receive its full value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they will also receive a 10% additional home loss compensation up to a value of £47,000.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’ll be reimbursed for reasonable moving costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rural areas we will establish a voluntary purchase zone which will go out as far as 120 million from the railway line, within which homeowners will have the option to sell their properties to the government for the full value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there will be a long term hardship scheme to help those further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also believe that the impacts of HS2 will be considerably less than many fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we expect property values to recover over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example of HS1 in Kent suggests this is more than a hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fear-of-change"&gt;Fear of change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings me back to something I mentioned at the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear of change in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows what would have happened to our green belt over the decades had the countryside lobby not protested and made its voice heard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we have moved on from the days when Swampy was headline news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve learnt from massive advances in green technologies and construction techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve learnt that it’s neither environmentally or morally acceptable to build new infrastructure without careful consideration of the surrounding landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve learnt that offering either an effective transport system or a clean and green environment is a false choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those road protests were against schemes designed more than a quarter of century ago, by a generation of road builders whose careers began when the very first motorways were being created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re investing around £2 billion in a programme of fourteen managed motorways schemes across the country &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than hugely expensive widening programmes, we’re making the most of our existing infrastructure through use of the hard shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with HS2, projects have to fit into the existing landscape, matching the topography, where necessary using false cuttings and planting new trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use quieter tarmac, and noise barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We build boxes for bats and tunnels for badgers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we sometimes build entire substitute habitats for protected species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of how much progress has been made is the A3 Hindhead Improvement scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opened last year, this project not only protects the surrounding countryside – but makes it much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tunnel was built to bypass the village of Hindhead and remove a notorious traffic bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the scheme also reunited two commons previously split by the road, creating the largest area of lowland heath in Southern Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers also planted 200,000 trees and shrubs to provide a magnificent haven for wildlife and lovers of our countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that isn’t a one-off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when we improved the A30 in Cornwall we bought land with Natural England to create new moorland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a 670 hectare wetland nature reserve – the largest of its kind in Europe – is being created on Wallasea Island…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…from almost 5 million tonnes of earth excavated from beneath London as part of the Crossrail project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schemes like these are not isolated examples of good practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re a pointer to the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt; – and the broader environmental lobby – can certainly take credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know you’ve got an even bigger role to play in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not proposing to emulate China, which over the next three years will build 70 new airports…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and ten massive new transport routes crisscrossing one of the largest countries in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we do have to modernise key parts of our transport system if the UK is going to be able to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what HS2 will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new transport network for the 21st century that will meet rigorous environmental standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. A final thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t just oppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider what’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And work with us to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>Video giving information about the High Speed Two property and compensation for London - West Midlands residents.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZEuSlc-xzw&amp;amp;list=PL229C4FFECA41C8FD&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;feature=plpp_video"&gt;High Speed Two: Property and compensation for London - West Midlands video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transcript"&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will be a national high-speed rail network linking Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds with London and Heathrow. This video sets out the property and compensation proposals for the first stage of the network between London and the West Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will bring transformational benefits to the UK: major investment; new jobs; regeneration in cities; improved connectivity, faster journeys and freeing up capacity on existing rail lines, which are becoming increasingly congested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But such a major project will also have environmental impacts and affect local property markets. The government has already worked hard to minimise the impact of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; on the landscape, protecting the countryside and local communities as far as possible by adding more tunnels and making changes to the proposed route between London and Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current law provides appropriate compensation for the vast majority of infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will be an exceptional construction project - the biggest seen in the UK since Victorian times. Because of the exceptional nature of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; we believe it is right to go above and beyond what is set out in law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is being proposed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The six key elements of the government’s proposals to help those affected by &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-1-a-streamlined-advanced-purchase"&gt;Proposal 1: a streamlined advanced purchase&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simplifies the compensation process for property owners in &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;’s safeguarded area; this is land that needs to be protected from any other conflicting developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-2-a-voluntary-purchase-scheme"&gt;Proposal 2: a voluntary purchase scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for rural areas where the line is not in deep bored tunnels. Property owners within 120 metres of either side of the line, but outside the safeguarded area, could ask the government to buy their property for its unblighted market value, that is what it would have been worth if there had been no plans for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-3-a-sale-and-rent-back-scheme"&gt;Proposal 3: a sale and rent-back scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would give greater flexibility for the home owners whose properties need to be demolished. They could sell their properties to the government, but remain living in them as tenants until the properties are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-4-a-long-term-hardship-scheme"&gt;Proposal 4: a long term hardship scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would provide cover for properties beyond the voluntary purchase zone. It would help those who have a strong personal need to move but, because of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;, cannot sell their home other than at a significant loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-5-properties-above-tunnels"&gt;Proposal 5: properties above tunnels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide confidence in properties above tunnels the Government will offer before and after surveys and settlement deeds and guarantee forever the rectification costs of any settlement or subsidence issues caused to properties by tunnelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-6-social-rented-housing"&gt;Proposal 6: Social rented housing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government will work with local authorities, housing associations and affected tenants to develop a strategy to replace any social rented housing lost as a result of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s proposals are designed to ensure that property owners and occupiers receive as much certainty as possible, as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government would like your views on these proposals. For more information please visit &lt;a rel="external" href="http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/"&gt;http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>High Speed Two - assistance and compensation for home owners and occupiers on the London - West Midlands route</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Written statement by the Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin MP, Secretary of State for Transport.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January the government announced that we would proceed with plans to build a high speed rail network linking London with Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. High Speed Two (HS2) will have a transformative effect on Britain, bringing cities closer together and providing the new transport capacity we need to meet the challenges of the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to drive forward with this vital national project. In doing so we need to provide support for those facing the disruption that the plans for the railway are causing, while also protecting the interests of tax-payers who will ultimately pay for compensation. We have been clear throughout that we are committed to providing appropriate compensation and assistance for those affected by the building of HS2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statutory system of compensation already provides fair compensation for the vast majority of infrastructure schemes. However, given the particular circumstances of HS2, in this case I believe it is right to go above and beyond what is required by law. Today I am launching a generous proposed compensation and support package for public consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the proposals set out today all those living closest to the route of HS2, in the so-called ‘safeguarded area’, will be able to choose to sell their home to the government - whether it is required for construction or not - at any time after the HS2 route is safeguarded, which is currently expected to happen in Spring 2013. Those choosing to sell their homes will receive its full un-blighted value (that is, what the property would have been worth had there been no plans for HS2), a home loss payment of 10% of the value of the property (up to a maximum of £47,000) and be reimbursed for reasonable moving costs, including stamp duty on the purchase of a new property of equivalent value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rural areas we will establish a ‘voluntary purchase zone’, extending out from the boundary of the safeguarded area up to 120m either side of the line, within which homeowners will have the option to sell their homes to the government at their full unblighted value at any time after the HS2 route is safeguarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those living beyond both the safeguarded area and voluntary purchase zone but who need to move house during the development of HS2 and find they are unable to sell their property, there will also be a ‘long term hardship scheme’ under which the government will buy the homes of successful applicants at their full unblighted value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, under the new ‘sale and rent’ back scheme, homeowners whose property will need to be acquired will have the option to sell their homes to the government early and stay in them as tenants until the properties are required for the railway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the owners of properties above tunnels may also be concerned about the potential impact of HS2 and therefore we are bringing in a series of measures designed to provide confidence in these properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will work with local authorities, housing associations and affected tenants to agree a joint strategy to replace any social housing which is lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must stress that we have already written directly to all those whose homes we currently expect to need to buy in order to build and operate HS2 on the London - West Midlands route. The wide-ranging proposals set out today reflect the significant nature of the concern that currently exists in the property markets near the HS2 line of route, they are not a reflection of what the government believes the long term impacts of HS2 will be. We fully expect that the impacts of HS2 will be considerably less than feared and that property prices will recover over time. However, we recognise that the current property markets near the HS2 line of route may not reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HS2 will be the backbone of a new transport system for the 21st century, offering the new railway capacity that our country will need to compete and grow. However, we fully recognise that the line will have unwelcome impacts on people living close to the route and I believe that this package of compensation demonstrates the strength of the government’s commitment to provide the right compensation and assistance to those affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the property consultation published today, we are also publishing a consultation on safeguarding directions for HS2. This will set out the proposed area of land considered necessary to protect the line of route from conflicting developments, that is to say planning permission being granted for developments on land that will be required for the construction or operation of HS2. This will also set the ‘safeguarded area’ within which compensation measures will apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both consultations will close on 31 January 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government unveils generous HS2 compensation package</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Residents affected by phase one of HS2 from London to the West Midlands will be offered compensation measures beyond statutory requirements.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents affected by the first phase of HS2 from London to the West Midlands will be offered a comprehensive package of compensation measures which go significantly beyond statutory requirements, the government confirmed today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HS2, a national high-speed rail network linking Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds with London and Heathrow, will transform the UK - bringing cities together, delivering jobs and growth, and providing a long-term solution to the capacity crunch facing the existing rail network. Stations will also be situated in the East Midlands and South Yorkshire, while high speed trains will continue on the existing rail network to serve destinations further north and into Scotland. The government has already consulted on the route of the first phase of the project to the West Midlands and the Transport Secretary will publish his preferred routes for the second phase of the scheme later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the government recognises the impact the project is having on property markets along the first phase of the route and, after careful consideration, has decided to go above and beyond what is required by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures proposed today go beyond the statutory requirements by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;providing a government commitment to buy any owner-occupied home in the ‘safeguarded area’ closest to the route - as set out in law, the government will then pay the full un-blighted value of the property, along with additional compensation of 10% up to a value of £47,000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;establishing a ‘voluntary purchase zone’ immediately outside of the safeguarded area in rural areas, within which homeowners can sell their homes at their full un-blighted value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a long term hardship scheme to help those with a need to move during the development of HS2 but who are unable to sell their home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a sale and rent back scheme to give more flexibility to homeowners who wish to stay in properties which will ultimately be required to allow for construction work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a package of measures to provide clarity and reinforce confidence in properties above tunnels, including before and after surveys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a commitment to work with local authorities, housing associations and affected tenants to develop a strategy for replacing any lost social rented housing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail minister Simon Burns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;HS2 will completely transform the UK. It will define our country, not just for the 21st century but beyond - linking our major cities in a way previous generations could only dream of.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;No major infrastructure project on this scale can be built without some impact on local communities, but I am determined to do everything I can to minimise the effect of HS2 on those closest to the line.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have developed the right compensation package, providing absolutely the right support for those affected, while at the same time protecting the interests of taxpayers. We have thought long and hard about this and the measures I have announced are fair and strike the right balance for local communities and the British taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compensation package announced today is comparable with the arrangements put in place for homeowners affected by the construction of HS1. It will now be subject to a period of consultation until 31 January 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the proposed compensation package, HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport has also launched a three-month consultation aimed at local authorities on safeguarding the land needed in order to build and run the line between London and the West Midlands. Safeguarding is the technical term for the planning mechanism that protects large-scale public infrastructure projects from conflicting developments nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to Editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation document &lt;a rel="external" href="http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/consultations/property-compensation-london-to-west-midlands"&gt;High Speed Two: Property and Compensation for London - West Midlands&lt;/a&gt; closes on 31 January 2013: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consultation events for the property compensation consultation will take place along the line of route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further information is available on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/"&gt;high speed rail consultation website&lt;/a&gt; or by contacting the HS2 enquiries line on: 0207 944 4908.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="safeguarding-consultation"&gt;Safeguarding Consultation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation document &lt;a rel="external" href="http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/consultations/safeguarding"&gt;High Speed Two: Safeguarding for London - West Midlands&lt;/a&gt; is available and closes on 31st January 2013: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation is aimed at planning authorities. An email is being sent to local authorities, community forums and MPs inviting them to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further details on the compensation measures published today: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streamlined system of advanced purchase within the safeguarded zone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under these measures, owner-occupiers of residential properties and owners of commercial properties (with a rateable value not exceeding £34,800) where some or all of the property is within the safeguarded area (usually 60 metres either side of the track) will be able to ask the government to purchase their property under compulsory terms at a time of their choosing after safeguarding directions are made (expected Spring 2013). This means they will receive the unblighted open market value of the property, a home loss payment (10% of the value of the property, up to £47,000) and disturbance costs (such as fees, removal costs and stamp duty on a new property of equivalent value).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government proposes that where the entirety of an eligible property is within the safeguarded area and the owner asks the government to purchase their property we will agree, whether it is actually required for the railway or not. We will also consider purchase requests where only part of a property is within the safeguarded zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streamlined system for voluntary purchase within a new voluntary purchase zone in rural areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government will also establish a new voluntary purchase zone outside of the immediate safeguarded zone within which owner-occupiers of residential property or owners of commercial property (with a rateable value not exceeding £34,800) will be also able to ask the government to purchase their property for its unblighted open market value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the impact of HS2 on the property market has been and is expected to continue to be greater in rural areas than in urban areas the Voluntary Purchase Zone will run from the M25 northwards to the south of the delta junction to Birmingham and to the north of the delta junction with the junction with the West Coast Main Line. The voluntary purchase zone will cover an area 120m either side of the line of route, except over bored tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hardship scheme for those beyond the safeguarded and voluntary purchase zones&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those with a need to move during the development of HS2 but who are unable to sell their home despite being outside both the safeguarded area and the voluntary purchase zone will be able to apply to have the government purchase their homes under a hardship scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sale and rent back scheme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will allow homeowners whose property will need to be demolished to sell their property to the government when they wish but remain in their homes as tenants until their land is actually needed for construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of measures designed to provide peace of mind for property owners above tunnels&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing before and after surveys at government expense and a ‘settlement deed’ which will guarantee that HS2 would be liable for any damage caused by tunnelling, in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the safeguarding consultation is aimed primarily at local authorities, individuals are welcome to contribute if they wish. However, if they are particularly interested in the proposed compensation arrangements for the impact safeguarding has on their home or property, they are encouraged to respond to the property and compensation consultation.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>High speed rail: Investing in Britain’s future consultation summary report addendum 2</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>A summary of seven hundred and twenty two (722) responses submitted online that were not fully analysed.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 10 January 2012, the government announced its decision to develop a new national high speed rail network following the completion of a major public consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 29 May, the consultation responses were published online. We have discovered, since then, that a small number of responses submitted online (722 of around 55,000 submitted in total) were not analysed fully by Dialogue by Design (DbyD) due to technical errors. For these responses, the answers to one or more of the seven consultation questions were omitted from DbyD’s analysis. In total, approximately 0.4% of answers provided to individual consultation questions were affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This addendum report is a supplementary analysis by DbyD of the seven hundred and twenty two (722) affected consultation responses submitted online. The report concludes that the affected responses ‘do not provide any information that was not already included in the previous Consultation Summary Report or would have made a difference to the substantive content or balance of that report’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport issued a statement about this to Parliament on 18 September 2012 explaining that the cause has been identified as technical errors in transferring data captured from online consultation responses to the consultation analysis database held by DbyD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those who submitted the responses affected have been contacted with details of their particular cases to notify them and apologise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>High speed rail phase 1 consultation update</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Written statement by Norman Baker, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government’s decision on 10th January 2012 to take forward proposals for a national high speed rail network followed a major public consultation exercise that attracted around 55,000 responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to proceed took account of a range of evidence including analysis by my Department and High Speed Two Ltd of issues raised in consultation as well as comments from a wide variety of interested parties through a range of engagement approaches. The Government’s independent response analysis consultants, Dialogue by Design (DbyD), carried out a detailed analysis of the consultation responses and a summary of their analysis was published alongside the Government’s January decision, with an addendum report published in July:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Speed Rail: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-consultation-summary/"&gt;Investing in Britain’s Future - Consultation Summary Report&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High Speed Rail: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/high-speed-rail-addendum/"&gt;Investing in Britain’s Future - Addendum&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since publishing the addendum report in July, it has become apparent that a further very small proportion of responses were not fully analysed by DbyD. For these responses, the answers to one or more of the seven consultation questions were omitted from DbyD’s analysis. In total, approximately 0.4% of answers provided to individual consultation questions were affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below shows how many of the seven consultation answers were omitted from the analysis in each case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number of question responses not analysed&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Number of respondents&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;520&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;130&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;44&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause has been identified as technical errors in transferring data captured from online consultation responses to the consultation analysis database held by DbyD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Department asked for supplementary analysis from DbyD and this work concludes that the responses ‘do not provide any information that was not already included in the previous Consultation Summary Report or would have made a difference to the substantive content or balance of that report’. Inclusion in the original analysis would not have changed the substance of DbyD’s findings, nor affected the considerations which informed the decisions following the consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those who submitted the responses affected will be contacted with details of their particular cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Because not all respondents answered all seven questions, there are 20 respondents in total for whom all the questions they answered were omitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
