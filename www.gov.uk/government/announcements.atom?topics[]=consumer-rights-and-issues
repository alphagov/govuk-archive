    <summary>Better shopping deals for the consumer gets a boost as the winner of the UK Buy Better Together Challenge is announced.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;28 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Smarterbuys’ scheme, which helps provide affordable loans to disadvantaged people so that they can buy essential goods, has scooped the £15,000 Buy Better Together Challenge prize, presented by Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Challenge was launched by BIS and Co-operatives UK in December 2011 to encourage groups of consumers to get together and negotiate discounted rates for buying goods and services in bulk. The Challenge received 110 entries, which were whittled down by a panel of independent judges to seven finalists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Fair Food Carlisle’ was awarded the runner-up prize for their scheme which uses buying groups to provide workplaces with a weekly supply of food from local businesses, winning £5,000 which will be invested in improving business processes and hiring staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event Jo Swinson said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;” The Buy Better Together Challenge has highlighted hundreds of fantastic ideas and examples from local communities, who banded together to make their money work harder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Collective purchasing is of immense value to groups, not just to make cost savings, but to increase social links in the community and reach out to vulnerable consumers who may not have access to online research or internet shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The schemes we have heard about today aren’t just benefitting consumers though; businesses have seen first-hand how they can gain more customers by working with these groups and communities, often beating competitors in the process. Many congratulations are due to the organisers of ‘Smarterbuys’, which is a positive example of how collective purchasing can challenge existing markets and provide better results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And I also congratulate ‘Fair Food Carlisle’ in supporting local produce growers and taking an innovative approach to boosting their local food economy. These schemes are a clear example of what can be done when consumers are empowered and work together to get better deals.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New power to boost consumers access to data</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Jo Swinson announces new powers for consumers to request their personal customer data from business, under the midata programme.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;19 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers will be given new powers to request their personal customer data from business, helping them manage their money better and make better lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Aug/next-steps-making-midata-a-reality"&gt;consultation this summer&lt;/a&gt;, the Government will announce that it will look to legislate if companies fail to comply with the voluntary release of consumers’ electronic data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/midata-review-and-consultation?cat=closedwithresponse"&gt;Read the government’s response to the consultation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under new plans, companies would have to release data they hold relating to a consumer’s consumption or transactions in an electronic machine readable format, upon request. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with the power to legislate will be focussed on three ‘core’ sectors: current accounts and credit cards, mobile phones and energy, with further powers to extend the legislation to other sectors if appropriate.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment and Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“‘midata’ is all about putting power into the hands of consumers. Many businesses reap huge commercial benefits from the information they gather from consumers’ daily spending patterns. Why shouldn’t consumers also benefit from this by having access to their own data to enable them to make better choices?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s great when your energy provider tells you how much gas or electricity you’re using at any point in the year or when phone companies tell you which one of their tariffs suits you best. But it’s even better when consumers can use that information to get better value for money deals or adjust their lifestyles.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is just one of many ways ‘midata’ can help, as businesses increasingly recognise sharing data as a means to deliver a better service for their customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next steps making midata a reality</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Government highlights latest proposals for the groundbreaking midata programme, which aims to give consumers access to their data.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;22 Aug 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;midata is a partnership between the UK government, consumer groups and major businesses. It’s aimed at giving consumers access to the data created through their household utility use, banking, internet transactions and high street loyalty cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing people to access and use this personal data has the potential to open up a wealth of opportunities for consumers and businesses, promoting growth across the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is committed to putting the UK at the forefront of this rapidly developing market. It is currently consulting on introducing a power that, when exercised, would give new rights to consumers to access their personal transaction data in an electronic, portable and machine-readable format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues/consumer-empowerment/personal-data/midata-future-10-ways-it-could-shape-your-choices"&gt;A midata future: 10 ways it could help shape our future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Minister, Norman Lamb said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“midata will allow consumers greater insight into their everyday consumption and lifestyle habits by using applications and intermediaries to analyse their actual behaviours and thereby empower them to make better spending choices and secure the best deals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will boost competition between companies in terms of value and service, and stimulate innovation in new data management tools and systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We want the UK to be at the forefront of the data analytics and information services market that is rapidly growing with huge international potential. However, it’s crucial that we engage with business and consumers to ensure that we do this in the right way.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2011 the government launched its &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2011/Nov/midata"&gt;vision for midata&lt;/a&gt;. 26 organisations signed up to help achieve that vision and today’s review shows that important progress has been made, with participants agreeing core principles about data release, publishing research into customer attitudes and beginning work on important questions of privacy and security.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy sector has blazed the trail, with many suppliers already giving customers electronic access to their transaction data and others to follow soon.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are encouraging developments but the government believes that the significant advantages on offer for consumers and the economy mean that faster progress to achieve midata’s vision is crucial.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/midata-review-and-consultation?cat=open"&gt;The midata consultation&lt;/a&gt; explores the option of taking an order-making power to ensure government has the flexibility to act if the voluntary approach proves too slow. We are looking for information to help us get the details right so we can have an effective implementation of midata that will remain relevant in the future. Further consultation would be needed before the power could be exercised through secondary legislation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government welcomes responses from business, consumer groups, regulators and members of the public by 10 September 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New proposals on consumer rights across Europe</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The government has published a consultation on the Consumer Rights Directive. It covers new measures to deliver greater clarity and transparency on consumer rights, and aims to help boost the confidence of both consumers and businesses.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 Aug 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give your views to government by responding to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/consultation-implementation-consumer-rights-directive"&gt;consultation on implementing the Consumer Rights Directive&lt;/a&gt; by 1 November 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/consumer-marketing/rights-contracts/directive/index_en.htm"&gt;Consumer Rights Directive&lt;/a&gt;, agreed by the European Commission in 2011, focuses on simplifying and harmonising rules in a few key areas of consumer rights. It aims to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that consumers have the information and time they need to make good decisions &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help make consumers fully aware of all the costs they are committing to and the implications of any contract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure that traders who treat consumers fairly are not disadvantaged by those who use less transparent practices to lure consumers to less competitive offers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer Affairs Minister Norman Lamb said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is an area where Europe can make a big impact on our day to day lives. Many people will have been ripped off at some point by hidden online charges while booking a holiday, premium rate helplines when returning a purchase or disproportionate and often unexpected charges for paying with credit or debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Consumer Rights Directive will put an end to certain bad business practices and help consumers make well-informed decisions when buying products or services. It will also boost business confidence, setting out clearer rules and responsibilities and cutting red tape by reducing compliance costs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Rights Directive contains provisions on: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Information&lt;/strong&gt; to be given before a consumer buys goods or services on the trader’s premises &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Information&lt;/strong&gt; to be given before a consumer buys goods or services away from the trader’s premises (eg at home or at a fair), or at a distance (internet, telesales) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cancellation rights and responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt; where the consumer buys goods or services away from the trader’s premises or at a distance &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Delivery times&lt;/strong&gt; for goods, clarifying what deadlines for delivery should be and where responsibilities lie if there is a problem &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Post-contract customer helplines&lt;/strong&gt;, where existing customers must be charged no more than the basic rate for phone calls &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Additional payments&lt;/strong&gt; (on top of the main price of a purchase) which would need to have active or express consent of the consumer eg pre-ticked boxes which the consumer must ‘untick’ will no longer be allowed &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fees&lt;/strong&gt; charged for a particular method of payment (eg credit card surcharges). This will be the subject of a separate consultation, to be published shortly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New proposals for consumer rights</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Government launches new consultation on a consumer bill of rights, seeking your views on strengthening and modernising consumer law.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 Jul 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed Consumer Bill of Rights will set out in one place a clear code of shopping rights and simple standardised remedies for when things go wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/consumer-bill-of-rights/"&gt;The consultation seeks views&lt;/a&gt; on rights and remedies for goods and services and digital content supplied under a contract.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announcing the consultation today, Norman Lamb, Minister for Consumer Affairs said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK’s consumer law is complex and difficult for consumers and businesses to understand. We want consumers to feel confident about their rights so they can challenge businesses when they buy poor quality goods, services or digital content such as music or games. These new measures aim to do just that.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses will benefit from the simplified set of rules, which are intended to clear up customer issues more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-proposals"&gt;New proposals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consumer law was written about thirty years ago and does not clearly cover digital content like music, software or games so consumers are poorly protected by the law. The consultation proposes clear rights for consumers of digital content to bring the law up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes will: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarify the nature of consumers’ rights and remedies in relation to the supply of goods, which is currently an area where the law is unnecessarily complex. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring the services regime more in line with the regime for goods, by strengthening consumer rights and remedies in relation to faulty services. The changes proposed include establishing a statutory guarantee and statutory remedies when the rights are breached, and the consultation also asks whether there should be a new legal right to certain services being judged on their outcome, rather than the way they are performed. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modernise the law on digital content to protect consumers, by establishing a clear digital content regime with its own tailored set of rights and associated remedies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norman Lamb continued by saying; “this Government is committed to delivering growth, and increasing consumer confidence will help markets work at their best. These measures will also help businesses save money by reducing the need for legal or dispute resolution costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is important that as many businesses and individuals as possible contribute their views, to help us continue to make the UK’s consumer framework the best for both businesses and consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sunday trading laws relaxed for Olympics</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Bill to suspend Sunday Trading Laws during the Olympic and Paralympic Games received Royal Assent today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 May 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bill means that shops with a relevant floor area of more than 280 square metres will not be subject to current Sunday trading restrictions during the Games.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspension will only be for eight Sundays, from 22 July to the end of the Paralympic Games on 9 September. After this period the current Sunday trading restrictions will apply again.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Mark Prisk said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This will be a fantastic opportunity to showcase, not just London, but the whole of the country to the rest of the world and provide a boost for the economy, sales and employment.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Retail workers will keep all their legal protections, such as the right to opt-out of Sunday working, but many will want to take the opportunity to work extra or different hours. I want employers to work with their staff so that we can all make the most of the Olympics.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to make it clear that this is a temporary measure and not a test case for a permanent relaxation of the rules in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspension will only be for eight Sundays, from 22 July to the end of the Paralympic Games on 9 September. After this period the current Sunday trading restrictions will apply again.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Mark Prisk said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This will be a fantastic opportunity to showcase, not just London, but the whole of the country to the rest of the world and provide a boost for the economy, sales and employment.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Retail workers will keep all their legal protections, such as the right to opt-out of Sunday working, but many will want to take the opportunity to work extra or different hours. I want employers to work with their staff so that we can all make the most of the Olympics.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to make it clear that this is a temporary measure and not a test case for a permanent relaxation of the rules in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New national board will uncover scams and rogue traders</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New proposals to create a National Trading Standards Board and make Citizens Advice a champion for consumer information.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/e/12-510-empowering-protecting-consumers-government-response.pdf"&gt;BIS has announced the latest measures (PDF, 310 Kb) &lt;/a&gt; to improve the systems of help, advice and protection available for consumers, with Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland taking on responsibilities from the Office for Fair Trading (OFT) and Consumer Focus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will mean: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new advice line succeeding Consumer Direct (launched by the Citizens Advice service on 2 April). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citizens Advice responsible for representing consumers’ interests in unregulated sectors (replacing Consumer Focus). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new National Trading Standards Board (NTSB).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the reforms, the new NTSB will bring together representatives of Trading Standards from England and Wales to prioritise, fund and coordinate national and regional enforcement cases.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NTSB will be responsible for gathering important intelligence from around the country to combat rogue traders, and tackle priorities such as internet scams, illegal money lending and other enforcement issues that go beyond local authority boundaries.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) has also set up a task group to look at how best to deliver the landscape changes in Scotland in both the short and long-term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Affairs Minister, Norman Lamb said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For too long people have been faced with an array of different bodies for advice and support, but its not always clear who to turn to first.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Citizens Advice service will become the publicly-funded voice of consumers, championing their needs and empowering them to make the right choices for themselves.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There will also be clearer responsibilities and better coordination between enforcers and consumer bodies. A new National Trading Standards Board is exactly what we need to combat priority areas such as loan sharks and internet scams.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All of the reforms will ensure that we have the right system of help, advice and protection for consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-competition-and-markets-authority"&gt;The Competition and Markets Authority&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition authorities will also continue to play a key role in empowering and protecting UK consumers, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=423713&amp;amp;NewsAreaID=2"&gt;following changes announced to the competition regime in March.&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will be responsible for promoting effective competition in markets across the UK economy for the benefit of consumers and allow more effective co-ordination with Trading Standards.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all the proposals will help streamline the consumer landscape and ensure a powerful consumer voice to business, government and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Improving Trading Standards to protect consumers</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Have your say on proposals to make it easier for Trading Standards officers to tackle rogue traders, and reduce the burdens on business.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation seeks to modernise consumer law by consolidating and simplifying officers’ investigatory powers set out in around 60 scattered pieces of consumer law into a single set. This will ensure that powers are transparent for both business and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals also aims to reduce burdens on business, by ensuring that officers’ routine visits are pre-arranged unless there are compelling reasons for them to be unannounced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They follow the Government’s agenda to simplify consumer law in response to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement/"&gt;Focus on Enforcement,&lt;/a&gt; which aims to improve transparency and practice within national and local regulatory functions, including Trading Standards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Minister Norman Lamb said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK has one of the best consumer protection regimes in the world but because the current law has developed piecemeal over many decades, it is fragmented and overly complex, making it hard for consumers and business to understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trading Standards officers’ enforcement powers are a prime example of this and we need a major simplification of the law to make it easier for them to tackle rogue traders and protect consumers nationally as well as at a local level.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron Gainsford, Chief Executive of the Trading Standards Institute said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At this time of great economic pressure on local authorities, it is vital that Trading Standards are able to tackle rogue traders as simply, quickly and cost effectively as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We welcome a consultation that seeks to consolidate and simplify the investigatory powers used by Trading Standards and believe it is vital that all stakeholders contribute examples of best practice and evidence any concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS also welcomed the publication today of a joint report by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/publications/Consumer-redress.htm"&gt;Strengthening consumer redress against misleading and aggressive practices&lt;/a&gt;. It would give consumers subjected to aggressive practices a right of redress, including a right to cancel the contract for a fixed period of 90 days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS will consult further on proposals to simplify other consumer rights later in 2012 for a new Consumer Bill of Rights to comprehensively update consumer law and scrap or reform some 12 pieces of existing legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>New £60,000 Community Challenge Prize launches.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-operatives UK and BIS have joined forces to launch the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/buying/the-buy-better-together-challenge-feb-2012/"&gt;Buy Better Together Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, an exciting initiative to help inspire new models of community buying, stimulate enterprise and promote shared learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £60k pot will go towards training and mentoring for stand out projects and includes £15k for the overall winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community buying allows individuals to combine their buying power to purchase goods or services together and get better deals from shops and other suppliers. It can also help businesses spread their overheads and in turn lowers costs for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Lamb, recently appointed Consumer Affairs Minister, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Challenge is a fantastic partnership between BIS and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uk.coop/"&gt;Co-operatives UK&lt;/a&gt; and gives groups a great opportunity to deliver real deals and social benefits for their communities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would encourage communities and businesses to get involved, read the guide on how to get started and submit an entry to the challenge on the website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Community buying has a range of uses to give consumers a bigger voice - from food co-operatives to heating oil groups - and I look forward to seeing the innovative ideas later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="buy-better-together"&gt;Buy Better Together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is now open to applications from groups and organisations within the public, voluntary or business sectors, which focus on creating new or developing existing community buying schemes. Applications are open from 21 February 2012 to 15 May 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give guidance to applicants there are three challenges. They are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Challenge One:&lt;/strong&gt; A project aimed at creating a platform, tool or vehicle to help individuals to come together and form a community buying group. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;**Challenge Two: **A project aimed at enabling existing or new community groups to develop their purchasing power by working collectively. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Challenge Three:&lt;/strong&gt; A project aimed at businesses to empower their employees or consumers to group for community buying. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criteria for judging the prize will include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greatest potential in terms of saving money and getting better quality. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Achieving long lasting impact or sustainability. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being able to engage a community successfully. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having social benefits, including helping disadvantaged consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed Mayo, Secretary General of Co-operatives UK, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Co-operative buying, whether informal with friends, student food co-ops or of crowd-sourcing online, is a growing trend among consumers and a good way to make your money go further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that almost 20% of people are buying co-operatively and with household budgets under such a squeeze, we are finding more interest than ever in co-operative models of business”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The midata vision of consumer empowerment</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Government has announced a ground-breaking partnership with 26 organisations to deliver a new era of consumer empowerment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The businesses, consumer bodies and regulators involved are all committed to working with Government to achieve its vision for midata, launched today. And all are endorsing the key principle that data should be released back to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;midata is a voluntary programme the Government is undertaking with industry, which over time will give consumers increasing access to their personal data in a portable, electronic format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals will then be able to use this data to gain insights into their own behaviour, make more informed choices about products and services, and manage their lives more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement marks the first time globally there has been such a Government-backed initiative to empower individuals with so much control over the use of their own data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching the midata vision, Consumer Affairs Minister, Edward Davey said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is the way the world is going and the UK is currently leading the charge. We see a real opportunity here, but others, including the US and EU, are also showing real interest in the programme and the economic benefits it can deliver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So if we want to continue leading the way, we need to develop a platform upon which the innovation and services that drive growth can be built. midata aims to do just that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/blog/2011/11/03/giving-consumers-the-midata-touch/"&gt;Read Edward Davey’s blog on the launch of midata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="midata"&gt;midata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall aim of midata is to benefit the economy, by stimulating innovation and growth, as well as companies and consumers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For the economy&lt;/strong&gt; - midata will encourage sustainable economic growth by boosting competition between companies in terms of value and service, and driving innovation. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For business&lt;/strong&gt; - midata will create opportunities for businesses through improved dialogue with consumers and increased trust, and the opportunity to provide innovative new personal information services and tools. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For consumers&lt;/strong&gt; - midata will allow consumers to access their data in a safe and secure way and make better decisions reflecting their personal wants and needs. New services made possible by midata will further assist consumers, whether it be in getting the best deal on their mobile phone contract or energy tariff, or managing their lives more efficiently. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-is-involved"&gt;Who is involved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses and organisations that have so far committed to working in partnership with Government to achieve the midata vision are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMEE &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoco Secure &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;billmonitor &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;British Gas &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Callcredit &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EDF Energy &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;E.ON &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Garlik &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lloyds Banking Group &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MasterCard &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moneysupermarket.com &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mydex &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;npower &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RBS &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scottish Power &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scottish Southern Energy &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The UK Cards Association &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following consumer groups and regulators are working with midata to represent consumers’ interests and concerns. As well as working towards potential benefits, their input plays an important role in identifying potential risks and helping determine how these can be addressed: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citizens Advice &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communications Consumer Panel &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consumer Focus &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OFCOM &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Office of Fair Trading (OFT) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>Government axes retail red tape</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Vince Cable announces plans to scrap or simplify more than 160 regulations that currently apply to retailers and their customers.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposals are the first results from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and will see significant changes to legislation that will make life easier for businesses and promote personal freedoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments from the public and business, along with a vigorous process of challenge within Whitehall, on the 257 regulations under consideration have led to proposals to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consolidate more than 12 pieces of overlapping consumer rights law with a single new piece of legislation. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simplify regulations that retailers said were particularly burdensome, such as age verification on some restricted goods, and licensing for low-risk products such as fly spray and toilet cleaner. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abolish symbolic cases of heavy-handed intervention, such as shops needing a alcohol licence to sell chocolate liqeurs. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove redundant legislation, such as the war-time Trading With The Enemy Act and its 98 linked regulations, and rules around the safety of pencils and prams will also be abolished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announcing the results of the Retail red tape challenge, Business Secretary Vince Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have to roll back the number of rules and regulations that our businesses have to deal with if we are to create the right conditions for sustainable economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have heard these promises by successive Governments before but these first proposals from the Red Tape Challenge show that we’re serious about doing that and we are making real progress.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But this is just the start. We still need the help of business and the public to make the rest of the Red Tape Challenge a success and free businesses to compete, create jobs and unleash a private sector-led recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has decided not to change legislation covering Sunday trading and to keep in place other rules covering areas such as hallmarking of goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2011/07/rtc-retail-announcement/"&gt;a summary of the proposals, alongside an edited selection of your comments,&lt;/a&gt; on the Red Tape Challenge website&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ridiculous-rules"&gt;Ridiculous Rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Business and Enterprise Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are now proposing to simplify, improve or abolish two-thirds of the retail regulations that we asked the public to comment on, cutting back the bureaucracy that our retailers face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These moves will help reduce costs especially for small retailers by cutting down the number of forms they have to fill in and overlapping and confusing laws they have to get to grips with.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the rules which are being scrapped or simplified:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2010.&lt;/strong&gt; These ban sales to the public of certain types of firework and age restrict sales. They include a ban on the sale of Christmas Crackers to children under 16. The Government is reducing the age that Christmas Crackers can be bought to 12 - the lowest age that EU regulations allow. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Imitation Dummies (Safety) Regulations 1993.&lt;/strong&gt; These prohibit the supply of goods which could be mistaken as dummies for babies. These are being scrapped as it is duplication and consumers are already protected by the General Product Safety Regulations. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Indication of Prices (Beds) Order 1978.&lt;/strong&gt; Prohibits anyone selling a bed from indicating at what price it could be resold at. this is being scrapped. &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Licensing Act 2003.&lt;/strong&gt; A provision of this Act requires a shop selling liqueur chocolates to have an alcohol licence. This is also scrapped. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bunk Beds (Entrapment Hazards) (Safety) Regulations 1987.&lt;/strong&gt; Aims to ensure that bunk beds do not pose a safety risk, we are scrapping this regulation as it is duplication and consumers are already protected by the General Product Safety Regulations. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Children’s Clothing (Hood Cords) Regulations 1976.&lt;/strong&gt; Aim to ensure that hood cords in clothing do not pose a safety risk. We are scrapping this regulation as it is duplication and consumers are already protected by the General Product Safety Regulations. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Trading Standards Institute Conference</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I made my first speech at your conference as the new Consumer Minister. I am glad to be invited back to speak to you all again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am here to make an announcement that I believe will put Trading Standards on a stronger footing for the future, and will help all of you meet the increasingly complex challenges you face in protecting consumers from being ripped off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am very pleased to launch our consultation on reform of consumer institutions.  It sets out our plans to establish Citizens Advice as a one-stop-shop that consumers can turn to for advice, information and education about their rights.  And it outlines our proposals to bolster the Trading Standards Service, so it is better equipped to protect consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because your service plays a critical role. Helping honest business grow and protecting consumers from rogue traders is essential to creating the safe and prosperous communities we all want to live in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why Trading Standards sits right at the heart of our plans to reform the landscape of consumer protection and improve the provision of enforcement and advice, education and advocacy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I have done a lot of listening. We have crafted our proposals to take account of what you have been telling us. I know about the financial pressures you are all facing and the tension between your local funding and yet the fact that you must address threats which go beyond local authority borders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want you to continue to meet local threats under the control of local authorities. But this should be better allied with regional and national organisation and, yes, more funding for you to work collectively to enforce the law against threats that don’t fit neatly within convenient local boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the consultation sets out a new model for national leadership of the service. But rather than describing this in detail today, I would rather sketch out for you a vision of the Trading Standards service I would like to see in a few years’ time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a service with effective national and regional leadership, with a much greater capacity to understand where threats to consumers are coming from, and to prioritise enforcement action to meet those which cause the greatest harm to the greatest number of consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Consumer Direct will reach far more consumers by being available online and by incorporating existing information from Citizens Advice. This will provide a much richer evidence base for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want this to be combined with regional intelligence officers in every region, and collaboration with Citizens Advice, Which?, and the new Competition and Markets Authority, so Trading Standards can point exactly where consumers are suffering and can focus on the biggest targets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to see a service with high standards of professional competence, using leverage and influence as well as investigation and prosecution to deliver real results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I envisage greater collaboration, with regional investigative teams supporting the smaller authorities and greater flexibility over who brings individual cases. These will be backed up by specialist national squads, located around the country, looking after the most complex cases in particular fields such as unfair contract terms or internet enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want a service that helps good people to move between local, regional and national teams, rather than having to leave to get promotion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want a more confident Trading Standards service, able to quantify and demonstrate the huge benefits that we all know you deliver for consumers in the UK. One that uses this information to celebrate your achievements, raises your public and media profile, and showcase the enormous contribution you make to public welfare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to see a strong national Competition and Markets Authority, specialised in understanding why markets have structural failings and with the determination to make markets work well. I see this CMA interacting with TS in a true spirit of partnership, seamlessly complementing TS efforts to pursue individual businesses with wider action against structural problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to see a better balance, over time, between local and national funding.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation is exactly that - nothing has been set in stone at this point. There is a lot of support for our proposals, but I realise that not everyone agrees with the direction of travel. There are some issues which have not been resolved and questions which still need answers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we need to think clearly about accountability and where to host specialist expertise. We need to work out corporate structures and governance and sort out finance and the costs of change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is your chance to shape the future structure of your profession and develop a consumer landscape which is fit for modern consumers and a modern economy. So I am urging you and your colleagues to respond to the Consultation and tell me what you like, what you don’t, what will work, what won’t - and the reasons why. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that times are tough at the moment, and the Trading Standards service is being asked to meet some big challenges - but that is often when inspiring ideas lead to the greatest advances. I want to hear all of your ideas in the months ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Empowering and protecting the consumer</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New Government proposals aim to simplify the current landscape, providing better protection and advice for the consumer.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer Minister Edward Davey announced today new proposals to simplify the confusing and overlapping provision of consumer protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new consultation &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//Consultations/empowering-and-protecting-consumers"&gt;‘Empowering and Protecting Consumers’&lt;/a&gt;, ministers want to see a new simplified ‘consumer landscape’ with public funding concentrated on two bodies that consumers trust and already turn to for advice - &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/"&gt;Trading Standards &lt;/a&gt;and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/"&gt;Citizens Advice service&lt;/a&gt;. It is proposed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Citizens Advice service to become the single service that consumers can turn to for information and advice. It will also act as their champion across a range of sectors. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To strengthen the leadership and coordination of Local Authority Trading Standards Services in tackling difficult cases that cross local authority boundaries. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run for 14 weeks until the end of September and government is keen that consumers, the voluntary and private sectors share their views on the proposed reforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Minister Edward Davey said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This government believes in giving more power to people. Our consumer policy is all about empowering consumers to make the right decisions for themselves when they buy goods and services.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we also need to ensure we have the right system of help, advice and protection when consumers need support. For too long people have been faced with a confusing landscape of different, public, private and voluntary consumer bodies, with overlapping roles and responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is not always clear where to turn for trusted advice and information which consumers need to make good choices or a champion to support them when they have been ripped off.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The proposals which I have published today seek to put an end to such confusion and make sure consumers are empowered and have champions. The Citizens Advice service has for a long time offered trusted advice, information and advocacy. So it’s right that it sits at the heart of our plans.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Likewise, Trading Standards are trusted by the public to do a good job in enforcing consumer law and standing up for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But there are barriers which get in the way of effective responses to rogues who operate across authority boundaries. Our proposed reforms will strengthen their hand in tackling these threats to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening consumer power helps drive competition, making businesses more efficient and innovative. Reforming the consumer landscape was a key part of the Government’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//policies/growth/the-plan-for-growth"&gt;Plan for Growth&lt;/a&gt;, published at the time of the Budget, and its focus on creating the right conditions to deliver strong, sustainable balanced economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Better choices, better deals</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A radical new approach to give more power to consumers in their relationships with business.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer Minister Edward Davey has announced today new plans on how businesses will provide key information to their customers on how they use and buy goods and services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help people get the best deal possible, and make business more dynamic in response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new approach is published in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-choices-better-deals-strategy-helping-consumers-make-better-choices"&gt;Better Choices, Better Deals: Consumers Powering Growth&lt;/a&gt; and marks a shift away from legislating to make change happen. Instead it announces new ways to help consumers help themselves and challenges business to innovate, which in turn will drive growth in the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="midata"&gt;Midata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the initiative published today will be a project called &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers"&gt;midata&lt;/a&gt;, which will assess how to give people their personal data in a format that is safe to pass onto third parties, such as price comparison sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an application or website can pick out the one perfect deal based on your user information, this will help to make consumer choices simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward Davey said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is an important new initiative that will radically change how consumers relate to business. By giving you more power in your relationship with businesses you will be better placed to get the deal you want, and that deal may put a bit of money back in your pocket.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This will in turn reward the most competitive and innovative businesses.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-people-are-saying-about-better-choices-better-deals"&gt;What people are saying about ‘Better Choices: Better Deals’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Professor Nigel Shadbolt, Chair of Midata: &lt;br&gt;
** &lt;br&gt;
“Information about how we shop, travel, communicate and live our lives is a powerful source of insight, so it’s important that each of us should be able to access our own data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am very much looking forward to chairing the mydata group, which aims to make accessing this data much simpler, and should be a watershed on how we use data to get a better deal every day.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice Chief Executive: **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Citizens Advice is an active champion for consumers. We help people get a better deal and make it simpler and easier to get information and advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are thrilled to be part of this new consumer empowerment strategy alongside Citizens Advice Scotland and Consumer Focus.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In particular we are really pleased to see recognition that in new technology is not good news for everyone. Some vulnerable groups can be excluded from best value deals and methods of redress.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our experience helping over 2 million clients a year shows that consumers have many varied needs. We look forward to helping ensure that provision for consumers really is inclusive and services and products are equally available to all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christine Farnish, Chair of Consumer Focus, said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It’s good news that government is looking at how more powerful consumers can create more effective markets and public services. While there are companies who want to provide better value and service, the truth is that if you don’t have demanding consumers, then you won’t have responsive markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A challenge for the government strategy is how it removes the barriers and opens the field for consumers to take action. This also needs to go hand in hand with making the most effective use of regulation and tackling the wider problems exhibited by consumer markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Since its creation Consumer Focus has campaigned for better customer information and complaints handling. Increasingly we have been pushing new ways to unlock the ability of consumers to band together and either discipline poor companies or reward good ones. The opportunity for coordinated consumer action through online and social media is growing all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The success of this approach will depend on whether it really helps consumers to mobilise their market power by coming together and showing companies the benefits of providing the value and customer service that people want.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Richard Thaler, co-author of Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness: &lt;br&gt;
** &lt;br&gt;
“This is a very exciting initiative that shows how modern technology can create entirely new ways of thinking about the government’s role in business regulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is of course true that we cannot replace all laws and regulations with nudges. However, this approach will give honest, high quality firms an edge in their battle with competitors who use obfuscation as their chief marketing strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Simple electronic disclosure is not costly for large firms to provide, and can provide enormous benefits to consumers. Eventually, this approach has the potential for replacing much more intrusive and burdensome regulations that firms inevitably find ways to evade.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Mayo, Secretary General of Co-operatives UK:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We welcome the growing interest in collective purchasing, from both government and from consumers. We are pleased to be working with BIS to launch the Innovation Prize. The best way to empower consumers is to enable them to come together co-operatively.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Wermann, Director of Corporate Affairs - Home Retail Group, Argos:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Argos always puts the customer first. Being at the forefront of multi-channel retailing in the UK we believe any successful retailer will need to evolve their product range, services and accessibility to ensure the customers get the best choice and value most suited to their needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Government’s consumer empowerment programme is a great way to enable this to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chan, CEO, Barclaycard Consumer Europe:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Barclaycard believes that digital technology - through simple online tools such as mybarclaycard, its award winning online servicing site which enables customers to analyse their spending, has the potential to really empower consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just imagine if people could easily access and review all their financial transaction data from all their banks, in one place, using simple web-based tools. We believe that could make a real difference to people, and that’s why we support mydata.”   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A competition regime for growth</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Government announces new proposals to create a single competition body, to boost growth and streamline processes for business.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/competition-regime-for-growth?cat=open"&gt;‘A Competition Regime for Growth: a consultation on options for reform’&lt;/a&gt; sets out proposals to create a single Competition and Markets Authority by merging the competition functions of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) with the Competition Commission (CC). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals to strengthen and streamline the competition regime will boost the existing arrangement in a number of ways. This includes reducing the duplication of costs for business, and increasing industry confidence in the system.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government wants to stimulate growth by allowing the market to be dynamic and competitive. Ministers also want to empower small and medium businesses by giving them greater support in the system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a single, powerful advocate&lt;/strong&gt; for competition with The Competition and Markets Authority.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing business confidence&lt;/strong&gt; through faster decision making, ending duplication, and more predictability of competition processes and decisions.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing barriers to entry&lt;/strong&gt; by making it easier for the competition authority to tackle anti-competitive mergers; and reform anti-trust provisions to increase deterrence of anti-competitive and abusive behaviour.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;**Delivering faster results for consumers, **with shorter end-to-end studies and investigations into markets where lack of competition is giving consumers a bad deal.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing the SME burden,&lt;/strong&gt; introducing an exemption for small mergers from the merger control regime.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving small business a voice:&lt;/strong&gt; an extended supercomplaints process to spotlight market features that harm small companies. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Davey said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK Competition Regime is regarded as one of the best in the world. But it can and should be even better. Competition is the cornerstone of growth, innovation and consumer choice. That means we also need to have a strong regime to promote effective competition in markets.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is an excellent opportunity to strengthen and streamline the competition regime to deliver better outcomes for consumers and increase business confidence and certainty. At the same time we are taking advantage of this chance of reforming it to assist small and medium enterprises. I hope that everyone interested in this consultation will take the time to respond to our proposals.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Better Choices: Better Deals</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for joining us today for the launch of _Better Choices: Better Deals _- the Government’s strategy to create empowered consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you’re here, you probably know the answer to the question “What do we mean by empowered consumers?” but let me give my answer anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, empowered consumers know how to make better choices, how to get better deals and how to get the right support when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we believe empowered consumers are vital to help the UK economy grow. Last month’s budget set out a plan for growth, to rebalance and strengthen our economy. Strong, competitive markets are at the heart of this plan, but their success depends very much on active, empowered consumers to drive them forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers spend roughly £900 billion every year. That’s more than seven times the £120 billion which business invests annually, so they’ve got a lot of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these are difficult times for consumers. Rising prices are putting considerable strain on household budgets and consumers need to make their money work harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this context, _Better Choices: Better Deals _is about two things. First, it’s about putting consumers in charge, helping them get the best deals individually and collectively, as well as helping the most vulnerable members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it’s about supporting the UK’s economic growth, enabling consumers to power honest, high-quality businesses in the global market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy will achieve this by championing new partnerships between business, regulators and consumer groups all aimed at empowering consumers to help themselves and each other. The Government’s role will be to facilitate this work and encourage groups to tackle problems faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Better Choices: Better Deals _is a unique, non-regulatory approach to helping consumers. Indeed we want to avoid regulation, except as a very last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would like to take this opportunity to briefly outline some of the important themes which will help us deliver these objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-power-of-information"&gt;The power of information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the power of information.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s choosing new car insurance or the right energy supplier, working out the best deal can be time consuming, especially when you are confronted with a jungle of complex options and tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence shows that even when consumers do switch suppliers now, they can sometimes fail to get a better deal. If consumers are to take more control, they must be able to access and use the data held about them by business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike all the marketing data or the information overload consumers get now from so many other sources. This data is their personal data. So it’s the most precious data for them to choose what really is right for them. So they can personalise choice, so they can know themselves just as well as the businesses who currently hold their information know them. So this ‘mydata’ project is a radical new approach to empowerment, right for the age of the internet and smartphone. It’s about giving people digital access to their personal data, such as details about what they spend on their credit card, or how they use their mobile phone minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe this access to more personalised data will help spur the development of new applications to help consumers interpret the data themselves. As well as a market for third party intermediaries ready to analyse and support the consumer in making better informed decisions with this highly tailored data. New choice tools to interpret new data, to nudge consumers into better choices and better deals. New ways to use extra information to overcome the current information overload. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give an example. Consumers should be able to use a smartphone app or send their details to a third party in order to find, the right mobile phone deal for them - based on their phone calls and internet usage. We know now that there are millions of mobile phone tariffs and deals and we know that that the average mobile phone user spends £200 a year too much buying minutes and texts and so on that they never use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘mydata’ depends crucially on developing a partnership with the businesses who collect and hold this data. So I’m pleased to report, we’ve already made progress in working with these businesses. More than 20 leading businesses have signed up to ‘mydata’, covering financial services, retail, utilities, telecoms and online shopping. They have agreed to work with Government to ensure customers can access their own consumption data in a safe, reliable format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realising ‘mydata’ will take a little while. But we’re starting to explore the many issues involved: from privacy to format, from security to the role of third party data crunchers. The applications of ‘mydata’ are potentially endless. So ultimately, consumers won’t need to work out what data to use or how to compare or make complicated calculations - they will just get the best deal for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-power-of-the-crowd"&gt;The power of the crowd&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second theme is the power of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Better Choice, Better Deals _sets out how we will support collective purchasing and other ways consumers can help each other - the power of the crowd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to say that people have been coming together to help each other on consumer issues for many years. Of course the co-operative movement began over a century ago on collective purchasing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we think that collective purchasing can become even more powerful in the years ahead. That’s why we want to work with the new group of Community Organisers, 5000 up and down the country, to encourage local communities to develop their own collective purchasing deals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will help by providing an advice toolkit for local people starting up these projects. We will also be launching the Innovation Prize for collective purchasing - a competition to encourage new ideas and spread the word on how people coming together can get better deals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second element of crowd power is information sharing, where technology is already empowering consumers with more access to the feedback of other consumers and of course through private sector online comparison sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there can be problems with such sites as unscrupulous people try to game their information. So we want to protect the integrity of consumer feedback and private sector comparison sites and the Office for Fair Trading has been leading vital work here. We think as a first step, there is a need to establish a self-regulatory quality mark for web and comparison sites that have clear and transparent consumer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also overhaul the way Government helps consumers make choices in public services, improving the choice tools available across the public sector. And we want to see the release of more regulatory data held by the Government on complaints and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="supporting-the-vulnerable"&gt;Supporting the vulnerable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our third theme is supporting the vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring vulnerable people do not lose out, in the face of rapid technological change and challenging economic times, is a crucial part of our strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our proposals include reforming the system of consumer redress to make it easier and cheaper for people to use, particularly, in the first instance, online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will be piloting access to in store consumer feedback for those who don’t or can’t use the internet. This will start in selected Argos stores. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help us develop other work in this area, I have asked Citizens Advice and Consumer Focus to work together to review and make recommendations on ways to empower the most vulnerable members in our communities. Both organisations are represented here today and I would like to thank them for their help with this project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-role-for-government-and-business"&gt;New role for government and business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our final theme is about looking for a new role for Government and business in consumer empowerment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that Government, business, regulators and consumer groups can work together to benefit consumers more than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes the Responsibility Deal taking it into new areas of public health, so people can make better choices about the food and drink they buy. And of course there are other applications of the Responsibility Deal in future times for the environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will build on the Prime Minister’s Corporate Social Responsibility initiative “Every Business Commits” and support professional standards to improve customer service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, there will be a greater emphasis on consumer enforcement bodies empowering consumers, as well as using existing regulation to tackle rogue traders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we recognise that Government doesn’t have all the answers. That’s why - in the spirit of this empowerment strategy - we are setting up our own feedback loop so consumers, business and others can comment, tell us what they are doing and suggest next steps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Better Choices: Better Deals _is an ambitious strategy, but one which has the power to change the way consumers access goods and services. I hope that all our stakeholders and interested parties, many of whom are gathered here today, will work with us to realise this shared ambition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Citizens Advice Consumer Empowerment Debate</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for inviting me to speak at your debate today.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your topic - empowerment - is a very timely and important one right now.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers are a vital part of the UK economy. They play an essential role in incentivising business efficiency and innovation, and therefore fuelling economic growth.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent figures show consumers spend almost £900 billion a year. This is well above Government spending of £640 billion, and more than seven times the £120 billion which business invests annually.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these are also difficult times, and making money go further when prices are rising is a challenge for families on limited budgets.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand that and that’s why we are working on two fronts - to make a real difference to the way we help consumers; and to empower them to help themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-consumer-landscape"&gt;The consumer landscape&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that getting consumer policy right is vitally important to citizens and business. This is why we believe that public consumer bodies need to meet head-on the challenges we face in this new era of globalised business.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As things stand consumers are represented by a bewildering array of public, private and voluntary bodies - many with overlapping responsibilities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of these organisations do good work and are respected, consumers can be left feeling confused by the choices.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our proposals to streamline these bodies and divert precious resources to the frontline - to the Citizens Advice services and Trading Standards - will preserve and in some cases even enhance the delivery of consumer protection.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time this will ease the burden on the taxpayer and make public money work harder.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Citizens Advice service - comprising Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland - is a respected brand served by a network of volunteers whom people really trust. In many ways, they are one of the best examples of the Big Society in action.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Citizens Advice service is also unique in its combination of long-standing expertise in national policy and front-line help for people. So we have a real opportunity to strengthen this connection between the needs of consumers with a strong national policy and advocacy function.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under our proposals, the Citizens Advice service will be responsible for all non-financial consumer education, information and advice - with an even higher public profile once it takes responsibility for the Consumer Direct helpline.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we propose to transfer to the service most of the consumer-related research and advocacy work currently done by the OFT and Consumer Focus.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, we’re creating a one-stop shop helping all consumers - on line, on the phone and face-to-face. While at the same time, the Citizens Advice service will have more strategic know-how to advise and campaign on the big issues which affect us all as consumers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be consulting shortly on all these proposals and I am keen to hear the views of all of you in this room today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="empowering-consumers"&gt;Empowering Consumers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, changing the landscape is only one part of the solution.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to see confident, empowered consumers able to get the best deals, demand better products and services and resolve problems when things sometimes go wrong.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if consumers are to boost economic growth, they need to understand the choices they face and be able to choose wisely. To do this, they require: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;information which is easily understood &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the tools to process and compare offers, and &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the confidence that goods are correctly described and that their rights can be enforced &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of you will be aware that we are working on an empowerment strategy, which will set out some of our plans to help consumers assert their rights more confidently.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already looking at four distinct themes emerging in this area.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we want to harness the power of information; giving consumers more scope to get access to the data which business holds on them. We believe that with greater transparency, consumers will be able to better assess the way they spend their money and make more informed decisions on the goods they buy in future.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we want to encourage collective purchasing - harnessing the power of the crowd, if you like. We want to encourage consumer-led demand, where people come together and negotiate collectively with a business to buy goods and services at the best price.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there is already some great work being done in this area, which we want to build on. As part of our research, we have seen how residents in some of the most deprived parts of the UK are coming together and getting the best deals from retailers for their communities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we want to help the most vulnerable speak with a stronger voice. We need to ensure that everyone has the skills to get the best deals.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And fourth, we want to bolster corporate responsibility. Consumer empowerment should not all be demand led. We believe business also has an important part to play in encouraging and responding to it.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me make it clear, this work will complement - not replace - our traditional consumer protections. The Government should stand up for the vulnerable and tackle rogue traders. But we should not look to regulation as the default position when it comes to helping consumers   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be publishing our strategy in the spring, setting out proposals and including some pilot projects which will harness advances in technology to test out our ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So clearly there is a lot of work to do here - reshaping the organisations that exist to protect consumers, and finding new ways to help them speak with a strong, confident voice.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are committed to working closely with our partners, including all of you here today, in the months ahead so we succeed in this ambitious task.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Trading standards - the year ahead</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, I’m sorry I can’t be with you in person today - I’m afraid I have had to stay in London on Government business.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to take this opportunity to speak to the conference, because Trading Standards teams do invaluable work right across the country.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say straight out that I am well aware of the cuts in budget that many of you are being asked to contemplate. But I am also well aware of the vital work you do, protecting consumers against rogue traders and scam merchants that can blight communities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unavoidable truth is that Trading Standards has to shoulder its share of the pain of deficit reduction - along with everyone else. But, as we have reviewed the current arrangements, our guiding principle has been to protect the front line.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future, you will be working in a more challenging environment - but it’s a challenge I am confident you can and will rise to.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Government believes effective consumer protection is an essential ingredient of a dynamic, successful economy. So empowering and supporting front line staff to deliver it is a responsibility we take seriously.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, despite the tough spending climate, we have announced an extension of funding for Scambusters and loan sharks teams for another year. These teams are a great example of how Trading Standards services can combine their resources and boost their capacity through collaboration between local authorities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach - working smarter, and finding new ways of doing more with less - underpins our plans to reform the consumer protection regime.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As things stand, consumers are represented by a bewildering array of public, private and voluntary bodies, with overlapping responsibilities. Each individual organisation does a very good job and is highly regarded. But, taken together, they form a complex landscape that is difficult for consumers to navigate.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best support we can provide is to concentrate as much funding as we can on helping local Trading Standards and Citizens Advice teams - across the UK - to work together to set priorities and deliver even better services to the public.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By streamlining the current complex model, we can boost consumer protection while making the public’s money work harder.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Trading Standards, taking direct control of national funding will improve networks and bring councils together to tackle the bigger, cross-border cases.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally the new money will need to be targeted on broader projects that respond to a national threat. And it must complement work already happening, rather than being seen as new funding for current projects.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, Trading Standards and local authorities will have much more discretion to work together to decide how funds are allocated and spent. Central Government should not micro-manage how the money is spent.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are some requirements that must be delivered, for example our commitments to other European countries.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in general, I believe Trading Standards officers know best how resources should be targeted to protect the public from scams, con artists and rogue traders. After all, you are in the front line of the battle against them every day. This is localism in action.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to touch briefly on our proposals to transfer funding for Consumer Direct to Citizens Advice - which, like Trading Standards, is a critical frontline service.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People turn to their network of bureaux for help on a wide range of issues - not just consumer policy - so it makes sense to bolster their ability to act as a one-stop shop.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing Consumer Direct under the aegis of one recognised and respected brand - Citizens Advice - will help the public know where they can go for information and advice on almost any issue. Accessible in a way that suits them.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizens Advice also combines long-standing expertise in national policy issues, with a clear grasp of the challenges that consumers face in their daily lives. As a result, there is a real opportunity here to make a strong connection between national policy and the needs of consumers in their local communities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I recognise that Consumer Direct has become a valuable source of information for Trading Standards officers about problems that need to be tackled.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me reassure you that its successor will continue that role - and even enhance this work, as the information received can be combined with that picked up by Citizens Advice Bureaux.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware the network is under substantial funding pressure, but the funding we are providing, from Consumer Direct and elsewhere, to the national Citizens Advice organisations will help them to ease these pressures somewhat.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know we are asking a lot of you. But we are transferring funding and responsibility to the front line because we believe that is where local services are managed best.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know you are up for the challenges ahead. Not just preserving Trading Standards’ first class service in what is undoubtedly a difficult financial climate - but being even more ambitious, and achieving even more, in future.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to working with you on this joint task in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Empowering the consumer</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Consumer Minister Ed Davey wants to explore ideas with the public, communities and businesses on empowering the consumer.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ed-davey---empowering-the-consumer"&gt;Ed Davey - Empowering the consumer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mum would walk to the other side of town if she knew she would save a few pennies on even one item - and I’d have gone with her. And on a big shop, she’d always check off the goods against the receipt when we got home.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty years later, I’m still up for a good deal, but as Consumer Minister I know the need to help be more easily informed of choices and options.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoppers now face a greater set of choices than ever and anyone can struggle sometimes to make informed decisions. The key is to be able to understand the choices confronting them, especially in a retail environment that has changed considerably with the rapid rise of the internet.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working on developing a strategy for empowering consumers, which we will publish in the spring. This will set out our proposals and include some pilot projects that harness advances in technology and digital media to test out our ideas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="collective-purchasing"&gt;Collective Purchasing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bis.gov.uk//assets/biscore/corporate/images/homepage/210x210/g-h/high_street_with_shoppers%20212x212.jpg?w=212&amp;amp;h=213&amp;amp;as=1" alt="High street with shoppers"&gt;To help with the process, we are working with consumers, communities and businesses to explore ideas. My Department has met with businesses, charities, and other public bodies, including Consumer Focus, to look at the concept of collective purchasing. This is where people come together and negotiate collectively with a business to supply them goods and services at the best price.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is not new; there is already some great work being done in this area. For example, a group of residents in a deprived part of Maidstone have banded together to bulk buy groceries for the local community at discount prices. The R- Shop was set up in response to one mother who had extreme difficulty managing the weekly shop with a small child and no car. The group, supported by the Social Innovation Lab for Kent, now collects shopping lists from residents, purchases the goods from a local cash and carry store at cheap rates, and then distributes from its own base - a converted, disused primary school kitchen.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an economist, the principle behind collective purchasing is very clear: it’s an ‘economy of scale’ - the more you sell, the cheaper you can sell it. Companies competing for the custom of better informed shoppers will in turn be more innovative, create better products and provide more value for money.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about saving consumers money. It can also lead to a greater sense of community cohesion, through groups of people coming together to purchase goods of common interest.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly the key to collective purchasing is finding enough people who share a similar desire or need, which is why a number of current models are focused on particular industries or localities. But I am keen to see how the Government can work with other groups to enable collective purchasing to flourish and help all members of our communities, particularly the vulnerable.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as working with our stakeholders, I would really like to hear your opinions about this idea, which you can leave below. I’m sure there is a wealth of experience and knowledge out there. So tell me what you think. It’s time for a change and we want to help consumers make that change. &lt;/p&gt;
