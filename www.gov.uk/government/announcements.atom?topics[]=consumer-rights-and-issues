    <title>Minister for Europe renews UK commitment to EU enlargement </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister gave a press briefing for European journalists today following his participation in the General Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 11 December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK remains a strong supporter of EU enlargement to all countries of the Western Balkans, Iceland and Turkey. I’ve just returned from the General Affairs Council in Brussels where I was pleased to have a long discussion on EU enlargement. Its conclusions make clear the EU’s continued support for enlargement. This is important, and a message that I hope will be heard clearly in the accession and pre-accession countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Enlargement is good for the EU and one of the EU’s greatest achievements. The European Union, alongside NATO, has been an instrument of peace and reconciliation that has helped spread democracy and the rule of law across our continent, and helped make armed conflict between EU members unthinkable. At the same time an enlarged Single Market, another of the key success stories of the EU, has opened up prosperity and opportunity to hundreds of millions of people. An outward-looking approach and a continuing commitment to enlargement should be seen by all EU Member States as signs of strength and vigour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Enlargement is also good for wider security and prosperity across the continent. The accession of new Member States helps promote security, stability and prosperity across Europe, based on a firm foundation of democracy, human and civil rights, and respect for the law. The focus on good neighbourly relations is particularly important for a region such as the Western Balkans which saw conflict only two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a respect for this firm foundation and its benefits which drives the UK’s scrutiny of progress and focus on conditionality. So the UK is clear that there will be no pause after Croatia’s accession. But equally there will be no movement without progress on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Foreign Secretary visited Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo in October. He set out clearly the UK’s support for each country’s EU future. But he stressed to the political leaders that they needed to take the necessary steps to deliver. I hope political leaders in all of the aspiring countries will do so and that we will see further progress being made towards the EU early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And the UK remains committed to Turkey’s EU membership. We strongly believe that this would contribute to Europe’s prosperity and security, and the EU remains the strongest lever for reform in Turkey. We are focused on making real progress on the accession process in 2013 and we fully support the Irish Presidency in their desire to open a new acquis Chapter during their Presidency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I will attend the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 10 December, and I will attend the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 11 December in Brussels. The Foreign Affairs Council will be chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton of Upholland, and the General Affairs Council will be chaired by the Cypriot Presidency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="foreign-affairs-council"&gt;Foreign Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-russia-summit"&gt;EU-Russia Summit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will discuss the EU-Russia Summit which will be held in Brussels on 21 December. Whilst I do not expect conclusions to be issued, we will aim to ensure that this meeting, the 30th such summit, delivers concrete results for the EU in its relationship with Russia. The discussion provides an opportunity for the UK to steer the EU’s objectives for the Summit and to ensure discussion focuses on concrete achievable outcomes, such as: resolution of the Siberian overflight charges; movement on market reform; positive developments in the energy relationship; underlining Member States’ concerns on human rights and democratic standards; and a more effective Partnership for Modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="western-balkans"&gt;Western Balkans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will review the situation in the countries of the Western Balkans, in advance of the discussion of EU enlargement at the GAC the following day. This will be an opportunity to consider the latest developments in the EU-facilitated dialogue between the Prime Ministers of Serbia and Kosovo: the UK welcomes the leadership of Baroness Ashton on this and is keen to see further improvement in the relations between the two sides. There may also be some discussion of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the pace of reform has recently slowed and renewed progress is badly needed, as well as consideration of the situations in Macedonia and Albania. I do not expect conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="southern-neighbourhood"&gt;Southern Neighbourhood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a discussion on Syria. Further to a UK drive to increase EU support to Syrian civil society, I anticipate that the EEAS will present its vision on how the EU can support civil society in coping with the consequences of the ongoing conflict and better prepare it for political transition. We also expect discussion on the relationship between EU Member States and the newly formed Syrian National Coalition. Having successfully amended the EU arms embargo (and sanctions package) by setting a three-month renewal period, we will make fresh arguments in support of amending the arms embargo ahead of the March 2013 deadline in a way that offers sufficient flexibility to increase practical support to the Syrian opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers may also take stock of recent events in Libya, including how to support the priorities of the new Prime Minister, Ali Zidan, and his government which has now taken office. There will be an opportunity to discuss the provision and coordination of international assistance to the new Libyan authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council may discuss events in Egypt following President Mursi’s 22 November Constitutional Declaration. The situation on the ground is changing rapidly, but we will argue for the EU to respond appropriately to the latest developments and clearly underline support for continued progress towards democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="middle-east-peace-process"&gt;Middle East Peace Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions on the Middle East Peace Process will focus on follow-up to the 29 November UN General Assembly Resolution, including the EU’s response to the Israeli decisions to build 3,000 new housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, to unfreeze planning in the area known as E1 and to withhold tax revenue from the Palestinian Authority. EU Ministers will also discuss facilitating a rapid return to credible negotiations in order to secure a two-state solution. We will reiterate our condemnation of the Israeli decision, underlining the threat this poses to the two-state solution, and stress the need to continue work to build on the May FAC conclusions. We will also emphasise the need for the US, with the strong and active support of the EU, to do all it can in the coming weeks and months to take a decisive lead and push the peace process forward urgently. Additionally the UK will stress the need to build on the Gaza ceasefire and to address the underlying causes of the conflict including more open access to and from Gaza for trade as well as humanitarian assistance, and an end to the smuggling of weapons. The UK will support conclusions covering these points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-us"&gt;EU-US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This item has been re-scheduled from November’s FAC. Ministers will have the opportunity to discuss the EU’s priorities with the US following the US presidential elections on 6 November and the re-election of President Obama.  I expect the discussion to cover a spectrum of leading international issues, including the global economy and a possible EU-US free trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
We also expect Ministers to agree conclusions on Ukraine and the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="general-affairs-council"&gt;General Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a substantial agenda for the GAC in December. There is a legislative deliberation on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union; a presentation by the Commission on the Annual Growth Survey; Preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December; endorsement of the 18 month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece; and a discussion on Enlargement, covering all potential candidates and including the adoption of EU Common positions for the Accession Conference with Iceland. Due to the large agenda, I expect many of these items to be brief and I expect most of the discussion to focus on the preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December and on Enlargement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="statute-of-the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union"&gt;Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot Presidency hopes to secure agreement on a selection method for additional judges at the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union: we have not yet received the final proposal for this.  I remain concerned at the current backlog at the General Court, which is damaging to the interests of British business.  My priorities in the discussion will be: to ensure that there is proportionate common law representation among any additional judges; that the costs of additional judges are covered within existing budgets; and that the selection method provides the Court with the stability it requires to function effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="european-semester-and-the-annual-growth-survey"&gt;European Semester and the Annual Growth Survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission will present key elements of the 2013 annual growth survey which can be found on the Commission’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual growth survey sets out the Commission’s views on the economic priorities for Europe for 2013, focusing on fiscal consolidation, promoting economic growth and employment. The survey, which represents the first stage of the 2013 European Semester, focuses on growth-friendly fiscal consolidation measures across the EU.  The European Semester is the EU-wide framework for coordinating structural reforms and growth-enhancing policies. We do not expect this item to be opened for substantive discussion but, in the event that it is, I will be supporting the focus on growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="preparation-for-the-december-european-council"&gt;Preparation for the December European Council&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agenda for the December European Council will cover: economic policy, including Economic and Monetary Union and Banking Union; defence; enlargement; and foreign policy. The last two items are covered by the separate sections of this Written Ministerial Statement on enlargement and on the Foreign Affairs Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the European Council meeting will focus on agreeing a legislative framework for Banking Union and an agenda for further Economic and Monetary integration in the Eurozone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the December European Council the Prime Minister will seek to ensure the integrity of the Single Market at 27, including in the context of the Banking Union and the European Banking Authority. We will also press for further progress on growth and ensure that the timetable for further integration in the Eurozone progresses at the right pace and in the right way.  I will argue that these concerns should be addressed prior to the December European Council so that solutions to these issues can be put to leaders on 13 and 14 December.
The December European Council agenda item on defence will pave the way for further discussion in 2013.  I will argue for a focus on developing capabilities, enhancing operational effectiveness and strengthening the European defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-18-month-programme-for-the-presidencies-of-ireland-lithuania-and-greece"&gt;The 18-month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAC has been asked to endorse the 18-month programme of the Council. This sets out the combined programme for the Irish, Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies of the European Council covering the period January 2013 to June 2014. I expect the programme to be published shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="enlargement"&gt;Enlargement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will seek to agree conclusions taking stock of progress on EU enlargement, and on the stabilisation and association process in the Western Balkans. The Commission released their Annual Enlargement Package on 10 October.  In this communication, the Commission recommended: (i) opening accession negotiations with Macedonia; and (ii) granting Albania candidate status subject to the completion of three specific measures and evidence of continued commitment in the fight against organised crime and corruption. We believe the communication to be a broadly fair and balanced assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will seek conclusions reconfirming the European Council’s support for EU enlargement and recognising that the accession process gives strong encouragement to political and economic reform and reinforces peace, democracy and stability. We agree with the Commission’s view that closer relations with the EU should be based on the principles of delivery on commitments, fair and rigorous conditionality, and good communication with the public. We agree that key challenges remain for most enlargement countries, including in the area of the rule of law. We also support a focus on freedom of expression and regional co-operation, particularly for the Western Balkans countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out the Government’s views on the Commission’s reports in my explanatory memorandum of 18 October. We will seek Council conclusions welcoming Croatia’s continued progress towards meeting all of its commitments in full before its expected accession on 1 July 2013, while reiterating the Commission’s call for Croatia to sharpen its focus to ensure this is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will seek conclusions that provide a fair and balanced assessment of Turkey’s progress, which will inject much needed momentum into the process to allow accession negotiations to move forward in 2013. I will argue that Iceland should be commended on the progress made in accession negotiations this year, while recalling the need for Iceland to address existing obligations, such as those identified by the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority under the European Economic Area Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also expect the Council to welcome the opening of accession negotiations with Montenegro in June 2012, while calling for early progress in the area of the rule of law, in line with the new approach to accession negotiations endorsed by the Council in December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the FAC discussion of 10 December, the GAC will discuss the Commission’s enlargement package for the Western Balkans countries. We remain fully supportive of a future for all of the Western Balkans countries in the EU, once conditions are met. We want the European Council to commend good progress on reform in Macedonia through the High Level Accession Dialogue, and hope the European Council will be able to build on this by agreeing to the Commission’s fourth successive recommendation to open accession negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a further report from the Commission, the December European Council will not be in a position to grant candidate status to Albania; we will want it to call on Albania to make early progress on reform implementation and establish a track record on tackling organised crime and corruption to enable a decision in 2013. I will argue for Council conclusions that underline that Serbia still needs to make real progress to deliver a “visible and sustainable improvement” in its relations with Pristina before accession negotiations can be opened, while noting that this remains in reach if recent progress continues.  We want the Council to welcome the Commission’s assessment that a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo is feasible and to signal that negotiations should begin as soon as possible.  We agree with the Commission’s assessment that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress on its EU agenda has stalled. We will want the Council to press the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to make progress and deliver quickly on those issues they themselves have agreed to, for example, on the EU road map agreed in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK Single Market Centre</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Single Market Centre brings together all the Single Market operational tools within a single team, including the Internal Market Scoreboard, SOLVIT (the problem solving mechanism that seeks to resolve the misapplication of rules by public authorities) and the Point of Single Contact (the online licensing service hosted on www.gov.uk for Services Directive Implementation). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key benefits of the Single Market Centre are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased awareness and confidence amongst UK businesses and consumers of the support available to trade and shop in the internal Market. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stronger links between Single Market policy and operations &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greater visibility and focus within Government on improving the UK’s performance in implementing Internal Market measures &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-is-solvit"&gt;What is SOLVIT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOLVIT is an informal problem-solving network that aims to provide a practical solution to a problem that arises with public authorities, where citizens and businesses exercise their free movement rights. The problem must concern the misapplication or misinterpretation of EC legislation, causing a denial of Internal Market rights for the applicant. There is a SOLVIT Centre in all EU Member States plus Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland that aim to solve problems within a short deadline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As SOLVIT uses an informal approach to resolving disputes, it cannot be used in situations where: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal proceedings, such as an appeal, are already underway &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The problem relates to a barrier established by legislation, as this cannot be resolved informally or within 
the deadline &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where deadlines under national law need to be respected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-point-of-single-contact-psc-"&gt;What is the Point of Single Contact (PSC) ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PSC is an online E-Government portal that enables service businesses to research information on how to do business in a particular region or service sector within a specific European country and identify what authorisations they need in order to do business. The PSC also allows them to apply remotely for any authorisations or permissions needed, including making any payment electronically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-internal-market-scoreboard"&gt;What is the Internal Market Scoreboard?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internal Market Scoreboard is published twice a year. It was created to ensure effective implementation of Internal Market law within Member States. It does this by benchmarking Member States’ efforts and providing an overview of each Member State’ s enforcement performance. BIS is responsible for monitoring the Scoreboard in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Scoreboard each year, covers Directives that are not fully transposed in a Member State, and have a transposition deadline up to and including 30 April. The second Scoreboard covers those Directives that are outstanding in a Member State, with a transposition deadline up to and including 31 October. The Commission publishes the results of each Scoreboard in a report around 3 months afterwards and it is here that the Commission analyses the performance of each Member State and highlights those where performance has improved, or declined.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buying Smarter Together</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;28 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Smarterbuys’ scheme, which helps provide affordable loans to disadvantaged people so that they can buy essential goods, has scooped the £15,000 Buy Better Together Challenge prize, presented by Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Challenge was launched by BIS and Co-operatives UK in December 2011 to encourage groups of consumers to get together and negotiate discounted rates for buying goods and services in bulk. The Challenge received 110 entries, which were whittled down by a panel of independent judges to seven finalists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Fair Food Carlisle’ was awarded the runner-up prize for their scheme which uses buying groups to provide workplaces with a weekly supply of food from local businesses, winning £5,000 which will be invested in improving business processes and hiring staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event Jo Swinson said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;” The Buy Better Together Challenge has highlighted hundreds of fantastic ideas and examples from local communities, who banded together to make their money work harder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Collective purchasing is of immense value to groups, not just to make cost savings, but to increase social links in the community and reach out to vulnerable consumers who may not have access to online research or internet shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The schemes we have heard about today aren’t just benefitting consumers though; businesses have seen first-hand how they can gain more customers by working with these groups and communities, often beating competitors in the process. Many congratulations are due to the organisers of ‘Smarterbuys’, which is a positive example of how collective purchasing can challenge existing markets and provide better results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And I also congratulate ‘Fair Food Carlisle’ in supporting local produce growers and taking an innovative approach to boosting their local food economy. These schemes are a clear example of what can be done when consumers are empowered and work together to get better deals.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New power to boost consumers access to data</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;19 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers will be given new powers to request their personal customer data from business, helping them manage their money better and make better lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Aug/next-steps-making-midata-a-reality"&gt;consultation this summer&lt;/a&gt;, the Government will announce that it will look to legislate if companies fail to comply with the voluntary release of consumers’ electronic data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/midata-review-and-consultation?cat=closedwithresponse"&gt;Read the government’s response to the consultation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under new plans, companies would have to release data they hold relating to a consumer’s consumption or transactions in an electronic machine readable format, upon request. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with the power to legislate will be focussed on three ‘core’ sectors: current accounts and credit cards, mobile phones and energy, with further powers to extend the legislation to other sectors if appropriate.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment and Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“‘midata’ is all about putting power into the hands of consumers. Many businesses reap huge commercial benefits from the information they gather from consumers’ daily spending patterns. Why shouldn’t consumers also benefit from this by having access to their own data to enable them to make better choices?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s great when your energy provider tells you how much gas or electricity you’re using at any point in the year or when phone companies tell you which one of their tariffs suits you best. But it’s even better when consumers can use that information to get better value for money deals or adjust their lifestyles.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is just one of many ways ‘midata’ can help, as businesses increasingly recognise sharing data as a means to deliver a better service for their customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues/consumer-empowerment/personal-data/midata-future-10-ways-it-could-shape-your-choices"&gt;A midata future: 10 ways it could shape your choices &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foreign Secretary Written Ministerial Statement on the Balance of Competences of the European Union</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish to inform the House that, further to my oral statement at the launch of the Balance of Competences Review (Official Report 12 July 2012, Column 468), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is today publishing the timetable for the review including departmental responsibility for the reports into each individual area of competence.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review will complete its work during 2014 and will look at the scope of the EU’s competences (the power to act in particular areas conferred on it by the EU Treaties) as they affect the UK, how they are used, and what that means for Britain and our national interests.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review will be divided into four semesters, each containing six to ten reports.  This will allow reports on related topics to be grouped together.   The reports from each semester will be published at the end of that semester.  If necessary, changes to this timetable will be made in order to take account of any events which could impact upon the timing of a report.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Semesters are:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semester One:  Autumn 2012 - Summer 2013&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Semester Two:  Spring 2013 - Winter 2013&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Semester Three:  Autumn 2013 - Summer 2014&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Semester Four:  Spring 2014 - Autumn 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first semester reviews will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an overview on the Single Market;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;taxation;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;animal health and welfare and food safety;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;health;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;development; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;foreign policy.     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Single Market encompasses such a broad area of competence that it is being split, with further reports on the four freedoms - goods, persons, services and capital - in semesters two and three.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Departments will take a rigorous approach to the collection and analysis of evidence.  The government department leading each review will, at the appropriate time, publish a Call for Evidence which will set out the scope of their report and include a series of broad questions on which they would like contributors to focus.The Calls for Evidence for first semester reports will be published shortly and will be available through the FCO website and through the website of the department leading each review.The reports into the first six competences will be published in the summer of 2013, along with the evidence received (subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government departments will consult widely, including Parliament and its committees, business, the Devolved Administrations, and civil society in order to obtain evidence to contribute to their analysis of the issues.  Our EU partners and the EU institutions will also be invited to contribute evidence to the review.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result will be a comprehensive, thorough and detailed analysis of where competence lies and what it means for the United Kingdom.  It will aid our understanding of the nature of our EU membership; and it will provide a constructive and serious contribution to the wider European debate about modernizing, reforming and improving the EU.The review will not produce specific policy recommendations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am placing the timetable in the Library of the House.It will also be published on the  &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/european-union/balance-of-competences-review/"&gt;Balance of competences review&lt;/a&gt; pages on Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office website.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next steps making midata a reality</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;22 Aug 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;midata is a partnership between the UK government, consumer groups and major businesses. It’s aimed at giving consumers access to the data created through their household utility use, banking, internet transactions and high street loyalty cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing people to access and use this personal data has the potential to open up a wealth of opportunities for consumers and businesses, promoting growth across the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is committed to putting the UK at the forefront of this rapidly developing market. It is currently consulting on introducing a power that, when exercised, would give new rights to consumers to access their personal transaction data in an electronic, portable and machine-readable format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues/consumer-empowerment/personal-data/midata-future-10-ways-it-could-shape-your-choices"&gt;A midata future: 10 ways it could help shape our future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Minister, Norman Lamb said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“midata will allow consumers greater insight into their everyday consumption and lifestyle habits by using applications and intermediaries to analyse their actual behaviours and thereby empower them to make better spending choices and secure the best deals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will boost competition between companies in terms of value and service, and stimulate innovation in new data management tools and systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We want the UK to be at the forefront of the data analytics and information services market that is rapidly growing with huge international potential. However, it’s crucial that we engage with business and consumers to ensure that we do this in the right way.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2011 the government launched its &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2011/Nov/midata"&gt;vision for midata&lt;/a&gt;. 26 organisations signed up to help achieve that vision and today’s review shows that important progress has been made, with participants agreeing core principles about data release, publishing research into customer attitudes and beginning work on important questions of privacy and security.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy sector has blazed the trail, with many suppliers already giving customers electronic access to their transaction data and others to follow soon.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are encouraging developments but the government believes that the significant advantages on offer for consumers and the economy mean that faster progress to achieve midata’s vision is crucial.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/midata-review-and-consultation?cat=open"&gt;The midata consultation&lt;/a&gt; explores the option of taking an order-making power to ensure government has the flexibility to act if the voluntary approach proves too slow. We are looking for information to help us get the details right so we can have an effective implementation of midata that will remain relevant in the future. Further consultation would be needed before the power could be exercised through secondary legislation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government welcomes responses from business, consumer groups, regulators and members of the public by 10 September 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New proposals on consumer rights across Europe</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 Aug 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give your views to government by responding to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/consultation-implementation-consumer-rights-directive"&gt;consultation on implementing the Consumer Rights Directive&lt;/a&gt; by 1 November 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/consumer-marketing/rights-contracts/directive/index_en.htm"&gt;Consumer Rights Directive&lt;/a&gt;, agreed by the European Commission in 2011, focuses on simplifying and harmonising rules in a few key areas of consumer rights. It aims to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that consumers have the information and time they need to make good decisions &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help make consumers fully aware of all the costs they are committing to and the implications of any contract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure that traders who treat consumers fairly are not disadvantaged by those who use less transparent practices to lure consumers to less competitive offers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer Affairs Minister Norman Lamb said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is an area where Europe can make a big impact on our day to day lives. Many people will have been ripped off at some point by hidden online charges while booking a holiday, premium rate helplines when returning a purchase or disproportionate and often unexpected charges for paying with credit or debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Consumer Rights Directive will put an end to certain bad business practices and help consumers make well-informed decisions when buying products or services. It will also boost business confidence, setting out clearer rules and responsibilities and cutting red tape by reducing compliance costs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Rights Directive contains provisions on: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Information&lt;/strong&gt; to be given before a consumer buys goods or services on the trader’s premises &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Information&lt;/strong&gt; to be given before a consumer buys goods or services away from the trader’s premises (eg at home or at a fair), or at a distance (internet, telesales) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cancellation rights and responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt; where the consumer buys goods or services away from the trader’s premises or at a distance &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Delivery times&lt;/strong&gt; for goods, clarifying what deadlines for delivery should be and where responsibilities lie if there is a problem &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Post-contract customer helplines&lt;/strong&gt;, where existing customers must be charged no more than the basic rate for phone calls &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Additional payments&lt;/strong&gt; (on top of the main price of a purchase) which would need to have active or express consent of the consumer eg pre-ticked boxes which the consumer must ‘untick’ will no longer be allowed &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fees&lt;/strong&gt; charged for a particular method of payment (eg credit card surcharges). This will be the subject of a separate consultation, to be published shortly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New proposals for consumer rights</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 Jul 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed Consumer Bill of Rights will set out in one place a clear code of shopping rights and simple standardised remedies for when things go wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/consumer-bill-of-rights/"&gt;The consultation seeks views&lt;/a&gt; on rights and remedies for goods and services and digital content supplied under a contract.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announcing the consultation today, Norman Lamb, Minister for Consumer Affairs said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK’s consumer law is complex and difficult for consumers and businesses to understand. We want consumers to feel confident about their rights so they can challenge businesses when they buy poor quality goods, services or digital content such as music or games. These new measures aim to do just that.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses will benefit from the simplified set of rules, which are intended to clear up customer issues more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-proposals"&gt;New proposals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consumer law was written about thirty years ago and does not clearly cover digital content like music, software or games so consumers are poorly protected by the law. The consultation proposes clear rights for consumers of digital content to bring the law up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes will: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarify the nature of consumers’ rights and remedies in relation to the supply of goods, which is currently an area where the law is unnecessarily complex. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring the services regime more in line with the regime for goods, by strengthening consumer rights and remedies in relation to faulty services. The changes proposed include establishing a statutory guarantee and statutory remedies when the rights are breached, and the consultation also asks whether there should be a new legal right to certain services being judged on their outcome, rather than the way they are performed. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modernise the law on digital content to protect consumers, by establishing a clear digital content regime with its own tailored set of rights and associated remedies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norman Lamb continued by saying; “this Government is committed to delivering growth, and increasing consumer confidence will help markets work at their best. These measures will also help businesses save money by reducing the need for legal or dispute resolution costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is important that as many businesses and individuals as possible contribute their views, to help us continue to make the UK’s consumer framework the best for both businesses and consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sunday trading laws relaxed for Olympics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 May 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bill means that shops with a relevant floor area of more than 280 square metres will not be subject to current Sunday trading restrictions during the Games.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspension will only be for eight Sundays, from 22 July to the end of the Paralympic Games on 9 September. After this period the current Sunday trading restrictions will apply again.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This will be a fantastic opportunity to showcase, not just London, but the whole of the country to the rest of the world and provide a boost for the economy, sales and employment.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Retail workers will keep all their legal protections, such as the right to opt-out of Sunday working, but many will want to take the opportunity to work extra or different hours. I want employers to work with their staff so that we can all make the most of the Olympics.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to make it clear that this is a temporary measure and not a test case for a permanent relaxation of the rules in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sunday trading laws relaxed for Olympics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bill means that shops with a relevant floor area of more than 280 square metres will not be subject to current Sunday trading restrictions during the Games.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspension will only be for eight Sundays, from 22 July to the end of the Paralympic Games on 9 September. After this period the current Sunday trading restrictions will apply again.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New national board will uncover scams and rogue traders</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/e/12-510-empowering-protecting-consumers-government-response.pdf"&gt;BIS has announced the latest measures (PDF, 310 Kb) &lt;/a&gt; to improve the systems of help, advice and protection available for consumers, with Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland taking on responsibilities from the Office for Fair Trading (OFT) and Consumer Focus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will mean: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new advice line succeeding Consumer Direct (launched by the Citizens Advice service on 2 April). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citizens Advice responsible for representing consumers’ interests in unregulated sectors (replacing Consumer Focus). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new National Trading Standards Board (NTSB).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the reforms, the new NTSB will bring together representatives of Trading Standards from England and Wales to prioritise, fund and coordinate national and regional enforcement cases.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NTSB will be responsible for gathering important intelligence from around the country to combat rogue traders, and tackle priorities such as internet scams, illegal money lending and other enforcement issues that go beyond local authority boundaries.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) has also set up a task group to look at how best to deliver the landscape changes in Scotland in both the short and long-term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Affairs Minister, Norman Lamb said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For too long people have been faced with an array of different bodies for advice and support, but its not always clear who to turn to first.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Citizens Advice service will become the publicly-funded voice of consumers, championing their needs and empowering them to make the right choices for themselves.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There will also be clearer responsibilities and better coordination between enforcers and consumer bodies. A new National Trading Standards Board is exactly what we need to combat priority areas such as loan sharks and internet scams.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All of the reforms will ensure that we have the right system of help, advice and protection for consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-competition-and-markets-authority"&gt;The Competition and Markets Authority&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition authorities will also continue to play a key role in empowering and protecting UK consumers, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=423713&amp;amp;NewsAreaID=2"&gt;following changes announced to the competition regime in March.&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will be responsible for promoting effective competition in markets across the UK economy for the benefit of consumers and allow more effective co-ordination with Trading Standards.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all the proposals will help streamline the consumer landscape and ensure a powerful consumer voice to business, government and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Spokesperson siad;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee (FAC) has published its report on UK-Turkey relations and Turkey’s regional role today. The report reflects the views of the Committee in line with its remit to examine the Government’s foreign policy. The Government will present its official response in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Foreign and Commonwealth Office welcomes the recognition given in the report of Turkey’s growing political and economic role on the world stage, and its analysis of ways to strengthen the UK-Turkey relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We also welcome the Committee’s endorsement of the Government’s steadfast support for Turkey’s EU accession, as an important element of the bilateral relationship. We believe that Turkish accession would be to the wider benefit of the UK and EU, contributing to our prosperity, security and stability. Turkey has made clear its firm strategic commitment to accession to the EU, and successive European Councils have made clear that Turkey is a candidate for full membership of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK is working closely with the Turkish Government, both bilaterally and with the EU to prepare Turkey for accession to the EU. In 2011/12, we have offered technical assistance on a range of issues, including freedom of expression, women’s rights, and judicial and public administration reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We welcome the Committee’s recognition of the strength of UK-Turkey ties. We work closely with Turkey on foreign policy issues critical to UK interests including Syria, the Iran nuclear issue, Somalia, Afghanistan and the Western Balkans. The Prime Minister has committed to doubling bilateral trade with Turkey over the next five years. Total trade reached £9.1 billion in 2011 - an increase of 40% since 2009. The government is committed to building on this success by raising awareness of market opportunities in Turkey amongst UK exporters, and tackling outstanding market access issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Committee has highlighted a number of concerns on human rights, particularly freedom of expression. We share the concerns expressed by the European Commission about Turkey’s human rights record, and we encourage the Turkish Government to take further steps to encourage greater freedom of expression particularly in the media. We welcome recent steps taken by the Turkish Government to reform its judicial system and look forward to further progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Committee also raised the Cyprus settlement negotiations, where we are committed to supporting the UN’s efforts to achieve a settlement based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality. “  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Improving Trading Standards to protect consumers</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation seeks to modernise consumer law by consolidating and simplifying officers’ investigatory powers set out in around 60 scattered pieces of consumer law into a single set. This will ensure that powers are transparent for both business and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals also aims to reduce burdens on business, by ensuring that officers’ routine visits are pre-arranged unless there are compelling reasons for them to be unannounced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They follow the Government’s agenda to simplify consumer law in response to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement/"&gt;Focus on Enforcement,&lt;/a&gt; which aims to improve transparency and practice within national and local regulatory functions, including Trading Standards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Minister Norman Lamb said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK has one of the best consumer protection regimes in the world but because the current law has developed piecemeal over many decades, it is fragmented and overly complex, making it hard for consumers and business to understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trading Standards officers’ enforcement powers are a prime example of this and we need a major simplification of the law to make it easier for them to tackle rogue traders and protect consumers nationally as well as at a local level.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron Gainsford, Chief Executive of the Trading Standards Institute said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At this time of great economic pressure on local authorities, it is vital that Trading Standards are able to tackle rogue traders as simply, quickly and cost effectively as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We welcome a consultation that seeks to consolidate and simplify the investigatory powers used by Trading Standards and believe it is vital that all stakeholders contribute examples of best practice and evidence any concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS also welcomed the publication today of a joint report by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/publications/Consumer-redress.htm"&gt;Strengthening consumer redress against misleading and aggressive practices&lt;/a&gt;. It would give consumers subjected to aggressive practices a right of redress, including a right to cancel the contract for a fixed period of 90 days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS will consult further on proposals to simplify other consumer rights later in 2012 for a new Consumer Bill of Rights to comprehensively update consumer law and scrap or reform some 12 pieces of existing legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Purchasing power to the people</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-operatives UK and BIS have joined forces to launch the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/buying/the-buy-better-together-challenge-feb-2012/"&gt;Buy Better Together Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, an exciting initiative to help inspire new models of community buying, stimulate enterprise and promote shared learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £60k pot will go towards training and mentoring for stand out projects and includes £15k for the overall winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community buying allows individuals to combine their buying power to purchase goods or services together and get better deals from shops and other suppliers. It can also help businesses spread their overheads and in turn lowers costs for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Lamb, recently appointed Consumer Affairs Minister, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Challenge is a fantastic partnership between BIS and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uk.coop/"&gt;Co-operatives UK&lt;/a&gt; and gives groups a great opportunity to deliver real deals and social benefits for their communities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would encourage communities and businesses to get involved, read the guide on how to get started and submit an entry to the challenge on the website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Community buying has a range of uses to give consumers a bigger voice - from food co-operatives to heating oil groups - and I look forward to seeing the innovative ideas later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="buy-better-together"&gt;Buy Better Together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is now open to applications from groups and organisations within the public, voluntary or business sectors, which focus on creating new or developing existing community buying schemes. Applications are open from 21 February 2012 to 15 May 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give guidance to applicants there are three challenges. They are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Challenge One:&lt;/strong&gt; A project aimed at creating a platform, tool or vehicle to help individuals to come together and form a community buying group. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;**Challenge Two: **A project aimed at enabling existing or new community groups to develop their purchasing power by working collectively. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Challenge Three:&lt;/strong&gt; A project aimed at businesses to empower their employees or consumers to group for community buying. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criteria for judging the prize will include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greatest potential in terms of saving money and getting better quality. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Achieving long lasting impact or sustainability. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being able to engage a community successfully. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having social benefits, including helping disadvantaged consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed Mayo, Secretary General of Co-operatives UK, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Co-operative buying, whether informal with friends, student food co-ops or of crowd-sourcing online, is a growing trend among consumers and a good way to make your money go further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that almost 20% of people are buying co-operatively and with household budgets under such a squeeze, we are finding more interest than ever in co-operative models of business”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU Ministers agree further sanctions on Iran</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking today the Foreign Secretary said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s action demonstrates the EU’s growing concern about Iran’s nuclear programme, and our determination to increase peaceful, legitimate pressure on Iran to return to negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is action made necessary by Iran’s defiance of six UN Security Council Resolutions and its refusal to enter negotiations over its nuclear programme. Iran’s recent decision to commence 20% enrichment at its underground site at Qom shows that it continues to choose a path of provocation. This is an enrichment programme that has no plausible civilian use, in a site that the Iranian authorities hoped to keep secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call again on Iran to answer the serious questions raised by the International Atomic Energy Agency, to adhere to UN Security Council Resolutions and to suspend its enrichment programme in accordance with them. Iran has it in its power to end sanctions by changing course and addressing the concerns of the international community. We are ready to talk at any point if Iran puts aside its preconditions. Today’s sanctions show how serious EU member states are about preventing nuclear proliferation and pressing Iran to return to the negotiating table. We will urge other nations across the world to implement similar measures and to increase the impact of the measures the EU has adopted”.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-on-european-court-judgement-on-taxation-in-gibraltar"/>
    <title>Statement on European Court Judgement on taxation in Gibraltar</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On 15 November 2011 the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) published its judgment in appeal cases brought by the European Commission and Spain against the United Kingdom and the Government of Gibraltar on the issue of whether corporation tax changes proposed by the Government of Gibraltar in 2002 breached EU rules on State aid. In this judgment the ECJ has set aside the earlier judgment of the General Court of the European Union (General Court) dated 18 December 2008 and has found that the proposed tax regime, which was abandoned some time ago and was never implemented in Gibraltar, constituted State aid on grounds of material selectivity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background to this case is that in August 2002 the UK notified the Commission, pursuant to Article 88(3) of the then EC Treaty (now Article 108(3) TfEU), that Gibraltar proposed to make changes to its tax system that would involve the introduction of a Payroll Tax and a Business Property Occupation Tax (BPOT). The Commission’s Decision of March 2004 found that the Payroll Tax and BPOT were materially selective because they would inherently favour offshore companies that had no physical presence in Gibraltar and which, as a consequence, would not incur corporation tax. The Commission also found that the proposed changes to Gibraltar’s tax system were regionally selective on the grounds that they provided for a system under which companies in Gibraltar would be taxed, in general, at a lower rate than those in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and the Government of Gibraltar both contested the Commission’s Decision in respect of both material and regional selectivity. On 18 December 2008 the Court of First Instance (now the General Court) annulled the Commission’s Decision. The General Court found that Gibraltar’s tax proposals did not breach EU rules on State aid on grounds of material selectivity. Moreover the General Court ruled that the frame of reference for assessing whether Gibraltar’s proposals were regionally selective corresponded exclusively to Gibraltar’s territorial limits. The General Court therefore upheld, under EU law, Gibraltar’s freedom to set tax rates that are different from those in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission and Spain both brought appeal actions asking the ECJ to set aside the General Court’s judgment. The Commission’s single ground of appeal was on the question of material selectivity. Spain appealed on both regional and material selectivity. The ECJ’s judgment of 15 November 2011 is the final ruling in these proceedings. The ECJ found that Gibraltar’s tax proposals were materially selective in that they granted selective advantages to offshore companies. It held that in view of its finding on material selectivity it was not relevant to examine whether Gibraltar’s proposals were regionally selective.          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECJ’s decision not to examine the issue of regional selectivity means that there has been no change in the principles established by the Court in the Azores case (ECJ case C-88/03 Portugal v Commission). According to those principles autonomous regional bodies within an EU Member State may set lower levels of tax than in the rest of the Member State without giving rise to State aid provided that certain criteria for determining the autonomous status of the regional body are met. In accordance with its constitutional arrangements, Gibraltar is a fiscally autonomous entity with responsibility for the management of its economy, including taxation, vested in the Government of Gibraltar. The UK is committed to upholding the Gibraltar Constitution. The ECJ’s judgment of 15 November 2011 does not change Gibraltar’s constitutional relationship with the UK or Gibraltar’s freedom to set a tax regime that differs from the UK’s.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is for the Government of Gibraltar, as the authority responsible for the tax system in Gibraltar, to consider the implications for Gibraltar of the ECJ’s ruling on material selectivity.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 15 November 2011 the then Government of Gibraltar issued a statement which stated that the judgment would have no adverse impact on Gibraltar since the proposed tax scheme that was examined by the ECJ had never been implemented and the proposal had since been abandoned in favour of an income tax of 10% for all companies. The new Government of Gibraltar takes the same view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government will keep the House informed of any further significant developments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The midata vision of consumer empowerment</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The businesses, consumer bodies and regulators involved are all committed to working with Government to achieve its vision for midata, launched today. And all are endorsing the key principle that data should be released back to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;midata is a voluntary programme the Government is undertaking with industry, which over time will give consumers increasing access to their personal data in a portable, electronic format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals will then be able to use this data to gain insights into their own behaviour, make more informed choices about products and services, and manage their lives more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement marks the first time globally there has been such a Government-backed initiative to empower individuals with so much control over the use of their own data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching the midata vision, Consumer Affairs Minister, Edward Davey said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is the way the world is going and the UK is currently leading the charge. We see a real opportunity here, but others, including the US and EU, are also showing real interest in the programme and the economic benefits it can deliver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So if we want to continue leading the way, we need to develop a platform upon which the innovation and services that drive growth can be built. midata aims to do just that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/blog/2011/11/03/giving-consumers-the-midata-touch/"&gt;Read Edward Davey’s blog on the launch of midata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="midata"&gt;midata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall aim of midata is to benefit the economy, by stimulating innovation and growth, as well as companies and consumers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For the economy&lt;/strong&gt; - midata will encourage sustainable economic growth by boosting competition between companies in terms of value and service, and driving innovation. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For business&lt;/strong&gt; - midata will create opportunities for businesses through improved dialogue with consumers and increased trust, and the opportunity to provide innovative new personal information services and tools. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For consumers&lt;/strong&gt; - midata will allow consumers to access their data in a safe and secure way and make better decisions reflecting their personal wants and needs. New services made possible by midata will further assist consumers, whether it be in getting the best deal on their mobile phone contract or energy tariff, or managing their lives more efficiently. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-is-involved"&gt;Who is involved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses and organisations that have so far committed to working in partnership with Government to achieve the midata vision are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMEE &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoco Secure &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;billmonitor &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;British Gas &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Callcredit &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EDF Energy &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;E.ON &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Garlik &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lloyds Banking Group &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MasterCard &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moneysupermarket.com &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mydex &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;npower &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RBS &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scottish Power &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scottish Southern Energy &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The UK Cards Association &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following consumer groups and regulators are working with midata to represent consumers’ interests and concerns. As well as working towards potential benefits, their input plays an important role in identifying potential risks and helping determine how these can be addressed: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citizens Advice &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communications Consumer Panel &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consumer Focus &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OFCOM &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Office of Fair Trading (OFT) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>Written Ministerial Statement on the General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a written statement the Minister for Europe David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council were held on 10-11 October in Luxembourg.  My Rt. Hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I represented the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="foreign-affairs-council-fac"&gt;Foreign Affairs Council (FAC)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAC was chaired by Baroness Ashton.  A provisional report of the meeting, and all Conclusions adopted, can be found at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/125028.pdf"&gt;http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/125028.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bosnia-and-herzegovina-bih"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although BiH was not a formal agenda item, Ministers agreed Conclusions which reaffirmed the EU’s support for the continuation of the EU’s military force’s (EUFOR Althea) executive mandate.  The Conclusions also included a reference to ‘looking forward to discussions’ on the future of the Office of the High Representative (OHR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="belarus"&gt;belarus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers agreed to renew the EU’s restrictive measures against belarus, and added sixteen new names to the travel ban and assets freeze list.  There was broad agreement that the EU should not consider renewing a dialogue with the belarusian authorities until all political prisoners have been released and rehabilitated.  Ministers also endorsed ongoing work by Commissioner Stefan Fule on engaging civil society in belarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers expressed concern about the trial and upcoming verdict on Yulia Tymoshenko.  There was a discussion about the impact the verdict might have on finalising the EU’s Association Agreement with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day after the FAC, Yuliya Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison.  Speaking after the verdict the Foreign Secretary said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The conviction of the Ukrainian opposition politician, Yuliya Tymoshenko, by a court in Kyiv is deeply concerning. Independent legal experts including the Danish Helsinki Committee have concluded that Ms Tymoshenko’s trial was subject to numerous and serious violations of fundamental legal principles, in direct contradiction of common European values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ukraine says it wants to join the EU one day. The UK supports that objective. But that cannot happen until Ukraine can show that it adheres to the highest democratic standards, including respect for human rights, the rule of law and an independent, transparent and fair judicial process.  The conviction of Ms Tymoshenko and the ongoing cases against other former members of the government call into question Ukraine’s commitment to these values. This could pose a major obstacle to the signature and ratification of the Association Agreement and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the EU.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-china-summit"&gt;EU-China Summit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers reviewed preparations for the fourteenth EU-China Summit, which takes place in China on 25 October.  The Foreign Secretary stressed the need for the EU to focus on increased market access for EU businesses.  He also urged the EU to continue to raise human rights issues at the highest level, and underlined the importance of global cooperation on cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="southern-neighbourhood"&gt;Southern Neighbourhood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baroness Ashton set out the results of the Tunisian Task Force meeting of 28-29 September.  She had co-chaired the meeting with the Prime Minister of Tunisia, which had also been attended by Member States, European institutions, the European Investment Bank, the EBRD, the World Bank, the Africa Bank and representatives from the private sector.  Around €4 billion was pledged to Tunisia over the next 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Egypt, concern was expressed by many Ministers about the recent outbreaks of violence.  There was broad agreement on the importance of protecting freedom of religion and belief.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers agreed Conclusions on Libya which:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reaffirmed the EU’s support for the National Transition Council.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Welcomed the continuation of the operation to enforce UNSCR 1973 and ensure the protection of the Libyan population.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Welcomed the adoption of UNSCR 2009 and the return of Libya to the UN as represented by the National Transitional Council.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stressed the need for all in Libya to respect all international obligations and the rule of law.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expressed concern about the dissemination of conventional weapons in Libya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set out the EU’s willingness to work under UN coordination to consider Libyan needs in the fields of democratisation, rule of law, institution-building, security sector reform and police training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers agreed Conclusions on Syria which condemned the ongoing brutal repression by the Syrian regime. Ministers expressed disappointment with the failure of the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution against Syria. They reiterated their determination to continue with targeted sanctions against the Syrian regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Yemen, Ministers agreed Conclusions which stressed concern about the situation in the country.  They called for President Saleh to sign and implement the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative.  And they welcomed the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and urged the authorities in Yemen to act on its recommendations.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the European Neighbourhood Policy, the Foreign Secretary and others stressed the need to hold out the possibility of meaningful market access to the neighbourhood, in exchange for real political and democratic reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="middle-east-peace-process"&gt;Middle East Peace Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers agreed Conclusions which reiterated their support for Baroness Ashton’s efforts on behalf of the EU to re-launch the Peace Process.  There was an appeal for both parties to resume negotiations under the terms set out in the Quartet Statement of 23 September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers expressed their disappointment with the recent settlement expansion in the East Jerusalem settlement of Gilo.  Baroness Ashton briefed Ministers on the Quartet Envoys’ meeting of 9 October in Brussels and plans to invite the parties to meet in the coming days. The Foreign Secretary emphasised the need for continued EU unity in response to any resolutions proposed at the United Nations in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion on Iran focused on two areas:  the EU’s growing concern over human rights, and Iran’s nuclear programme.  On human rights, Ministers agreed to add twenty-nine names to its sanctions list, in addition to the thirty-two officials previously agreed in April.  On the nuclear issue, Baroness Ashton briefed Ministers on E3+3 talks in New York in the margin of the UN General Assembly and her meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister.  She also outlined plans for taking forward talks with Iran.  The Foreign Secretary made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome the EU’s agreement today to impose restrictive measures on a further twenty-nine Iranians responsible for grave human rights abuses. Those targeted include Government Ministers, members of the security forces, prison staff and judiciary responsible for serious human rights violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In recent months the human rights situation in Iran has continued to deteriorate. As we mark World Day against the Death Penalty we should recall that Iran has now executed over 500 people this year, including a 17 year old boy. The government has violently suppressed protests over the mismanagement of a lake in north-west Iran, and families of a number of journalists have been arrested and harassed. We will continue to identify and list those who seriously violate the human rights of the Iranian people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s decision sends a clear message to every individual on this list, and others in the Iranian regime, that we will not stand by. They will be held to account for their actions and should not involve themselves in the appalling abuses we continue to witness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-external-representation"&gt;EU External Representation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers had a brief informal exchange on EU external representation in international organisations.  The Foreign Secretary said we supported effective external action by the EU, in accordance with the Treaties.  But we needed to ensure that this did not affect the balance of competences between the EU and Member States; and that Member States remained free to act where they had the right to do so.  He agreed that the EAS should propose effective arrangements in line with these principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="general-affairs-council-gac"&gt;General Affairs Council (GAC)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GAC was chaired by the Polish EU Presidency (Mikolaj Dowgielewicz, State Secretary for European Affairs).  A draft record of the meeting can be found at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/genaff/125036.pdf"&gt;http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/genaff/125036.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="cohesion-policy"&gt;Cohesion Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers heard a presentation by Commissioner Hahn (Regional Policy) of proposals for rules on implementing the EU’s policy on economic and social cohesion in 2012-20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="growth-enhancing-measures"&gt;Growth-Enhancing Measures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Presidency presented its report “Towards a European consensus on growth” (see link below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://pl2011.eu/sites/default/files/users/shared/spotkania_i_wydarzenia/presidency_report_on_growth.pdf"&gt;http://pl2011.eu/sites/default/files/users/shared/spotkania_i_wydarzenia/presidency_report_on_growth.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report identifies potential growth-enhancing measures which might help the EU overcome the current economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="g20-summit-in-cannes"&gt;G20 Summit in Cannes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers discussed with Commissioner Sefcovic (Inter-Institutional Relations and Administration) preparations for the G-20 Summit in Cannes on 3-4 November.  The Commissioner  set out proposed EU priorities: the Eurozone and the global economic recovery; the resilience of the international monetary system; tackling commodity prices; providing a way forward for Doha and the WTO; development; food security; a strong message on Climate Change and Durban; and the proposed Financial Transaction Tax (FTT).  I stressed that the UK was firmly against promoting a FTT at the G20 Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="preparation-of-the-october-european-council"&gt;Preparation of the October European Council&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the GAC, the President of the Council, Van Rompuy, joined Ministers by video link to discuss preparations for the Council.  He explained that the Council had been pushed back to Sunday 23 October to allow Heads of State and Government to consider issues relating to Greece, the European banks and the Eurozone governance more comprehensively as a package.  I argued that any future institutional changes to governance in the Eurozone had to protect fully the interests of all 27 Member States, and there had to be clear language to that effect in the European Council Conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also stressed the need for the Council Conclusions to address some significant foreign policy developments, particularly Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will deposit copies of this note in the libraries of both Houses. And I will also continue to update Parliament on future Foreign and General Affairs Councils.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government axes retail red tape</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposals are the first results from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and will see significant changes to legislation that will make life easier for businesses and promote personal freedoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments from the public and business, along with a vigorous process of challenge within Whitehall, on the 257 regulations under consideration have led to proposals to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consolidate more than 12 pieces of overlapping consumer rights law with a single new piece of legislation. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simplify regulations that retailers said were particularly burdensome, such as age verification on some restricted goods, and licensing for low-risk products such as fly spray and toilet cleaner. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abolish symbolic cases of heavy-handed intervention, such as shops needing a alcohol licence to sell chocolate liqeurs. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove redundant legislation, such as the war-time Trading With The Enemy Act and its 98 linked regulations, and rules around the safety of pencils and prams will also be abolished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announcing the results of the Retail red tape challenge, Business Secretary Vince Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have to roll back the number of rules and regulations that our businesses have to deal with if we are to create the right conditions for sustainable economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have heard these promises by successive Governments before but these first proposals from the Red Tape Challenge show that we’re serious about doing that and we are making real progress.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But this is just the start. We still need the help of business and the public to make the rest of the Red Tape Challenge a success and free businesses to compete, create jobs and unleash a private sector-led recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has decided not to change legislation covering Sunday trading and to keep in place other rules covering areas such as hallmarking of goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2011/07/rtc-retail-announcement/"&gt;a summary of the proposals, alongside an edited selection of your comments,&lt;/a&gt; on the Red Tape Challenge website&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ridiculous-rules"&gt;Ridiculous Rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Business and Enterprise Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are now proposing to simplify, improve or abolish two-thirds of the retail regulations that we asked the public to comment on, cutting back the bureaucracy that our retailers face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These moves will help reduce costs especially for small retailers by cutting down the number of forms they have to fill in and overlapping and confusing laws they have to get to grips with.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the rules which are being scrapped or simplified:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2010.&lt;/strong&gt; These ban sales to the public of certain types of firework and age restrict sales. They include a ban on the sale of Christmas Crackers to children under 16. The Government is reducing the age that Christmas Crackers can be bought to 12 - the lowest age that EU regulations allow. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Imitation Dummies (Safety) Regulations 1993.&lt;/strong&gt; These prohibit the supply of goods which could be mistaken as dummies for babies. These are being scrapped as it is duplication and consumers are already protected by the General Product Safety Regulations. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Indication of Prices (Beds) Order 1978.&lt;/strong&gt; Prohibits anyone selling a bed from indicating at what price it could be resold at. this is being scrapped. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pencils and Graphic Instruments (Safety) Regulations 1998.&lt;/strong&gt; Aims to protect people from exposure to heavy metals in pencil coatings. This is being scrapped as it is duplication and consumers are already protected by the General Product Safety Regulations. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Licensing Act 2003.&lt;/strong&gt; A provision of this Act requires a shop selling liqueur chocolates to have an alcohol licence. This is also scrapped. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bunk Beds (Entrapment Hazards) (Safety) Regulations 1987.&lt;/strong&gt; Aims to ensure that bunk beds do not pose a safety risk, we are scrapping this regulation as it is duplication and consumers are already protected by the General Product Safety Regulations. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Children’s Clothing (Hood Cords) Regulations 1976.&lt;/strong&gt; Aim to ensure that hood cords in clothing do not pose a safety risk. We are scrapping this regulation as it is duplication and consumers are already protected by the General Product Safety Regulations. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wheeled Child Conveyances (Safety) Regulations 1997.&lt;/strong&gt; Outlines standards for prams and pushchairs. We are scrapping this regulation as it is duplication and consumers are already protected by the General Product Safety Regulations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-challenge"&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retail theme opened on 7 April 2011 and was open until 10 May. Almost 9,000 comments were made on the website accompanied by written submissions from a variety of business groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red Tape Challenge campaign is part of the Government’s growth agenda and will tackle the stock of more than 21,000 statutory instruments, many of which are currently putting barriers in the way of businesses, volunteers and the public. &lt;/p&gt;
