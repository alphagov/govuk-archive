    <title>Changes to the building regulations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am setting out today the changes that will be made to the building regulations regime in England to deliver an even better and more cost-effective way of ensuring our buildings remain safe and sustainable. The changes will deliver savings of around £50 million per year to business. In addition, legislation will also be laid before Parliament shortly to amend the Energy Performance of Buildings Regulations and to repeal unnecessary fire provisions of Local Acts which overlap national provisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-access-statements-security-changing-places-toilets-and-regulation-7"&gt;consultation paper&lt;/a&gt; issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 31 January this year contained a range of proposals to improve the building regulations regime. I am setting out today decisions on the deregulatory changes. I am also publishing today a document providing a factual summary of the responses received. The changes have been developed after active engagement with external partners and demonstrate the government’s ongoing commitment to ensuring that where regulation is necessary the impact on business is properly considered and the associated cost minimised. Decisions on the outstanding issues relating to the energy efficiency of buildings, on better targeting of radon protection measures and the referencing of British Standards for structural design based on Eurocodes will be set out in a further statement next year. We will also set out next year the outcome of the review of the framework of building regulations and local housing standards which I announced in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement with our external partners shows that they continue to value the national minimum standards provided by the building regulations. However, where any concerns do arise it is necessary to address them. That is why we listened to those that expressed concern with the costs associated with the electrical safety in the home provisions in Part P of the building regulations. Some have even advocated that Part P should be revoked as a burdensome requirement on competent electricians. We disagree - Part P has been a success - but we do recognise that there is scope to streamline the requirements by removing the requirement to notify smaller-scale, lower-risk electrical work to a building control body. Currently homeowners can face building control fees of upwards of £240 to have simple electrical work, such as an additional plug socket in a kitchen, approved by a local authority. This change will see the notification requirements focused on higher-risk jobs like the installation of new circuits, or work in the vicinity of showers and baths, which is the right approach. There will, of course, remain a duty for these non-notifiable works to comply with the safety provisions required by the regulations and which we have also updated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Part P seeks to achieve a reasonable balance of risk. We will continue to monitor indicators which can help identify the impact of the changes and keep this under review. But the key to ensuring electrical work is done properly is to employ competent electricians and so the department will continue to work closely with external partners to identify what more can be done to promote the importance of complying with the provisions of Part P through use of a suitably-qualified electrician. In addition, I will be bringing forward further regulations later next year that will introduce an alternative route to demonstrating compliance with Part P by allowing for third-party certification of electrical work. This will safeguard standards whilst providing a far cheaper way of verifying work is adequate - particularly for those carrying out DIY work. These changes will be accompanied by simpler, clearer and shorter guidance in a new Approved Document P that we will be publishing shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we will be making a number of other changes to the building regulations. We will amend the technical guidance in Approved Document B (Fire safety). In particular, we will update guidance in respect of lighting diffusers which has grown out-of-date as lighting technology has changed considerably. We will also, in relation to wall coverings, be taking forward changes to mitigate problems associated with how the European reaction to fire classifications work in practice. In effect, the changes will maintain the status quo, for example, allowing wallpapers that are currently used to continue to be so in the future. Both these changes have been supported by independent research which shows there are no adverse impacts on safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also be taking forward rationalisation of guidance supporting Parts M, K and N (Access, Protection from falling, collision and impact and Glazing respectively) to address areas of conflict and overlap, which again impose unnecessary costs. At the same time we will clarify the guidance on Access Statements in Approved Document M to promote a more proportionate, risk-based approach. These changes will be delivered by clearer guidance in a new Approved Document K and amendment of other Approved Documents which I will be publishing shortly. We intend that all of these deregulatory changes will come into force on 6 April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the changes to the ‘technical’ provisions, we have also agreed a number of improvements to the building control system. These are relatively minor changes to benefit both local authorities and Approved Inspectors through changes to the procedures around completion certificates, statutory notifications and removal of the ‘Warranty Link Rule’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes to regulations also extend the scope for existing competent person scheme operators. This will allow more work to be self-certified and thereby avoid the need to notify a building control body or pay a building control charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to the building regulations, we will also be publishing shortly a new Approved Document 7 which provides updated guidance on adequate materials and workmanship for building work, in particular the implications of the full implementation of the European Construction Products Regulation on 1 July 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated Energy Performance of Buildings Regulations will also be laid before the House shortly. These, in addition to consolidating the existing regulations, transpose the requirements of the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2010 and remove unnecessary ‘gold-plating’. The Directive is an EU measure designed to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of carbon produced by buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new requirements will be introduced on 9 January 2013. The key measures include a requirement for property advertisements to include details of the Energy Performance Certificate rating where available; removal of the requirement to attach the front page of the certificate to any written material; exempting listed buildings from the need to have a certificate on their sale or rent; extending the current requirement for a display energy certificate in large public buildings, to public buildings above 500m² and; introducing a requirement for a certificate to be displayed in commercial premises larger than 500m² that are frequently visited by the public and where one has been previously issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, given this statement relates to the regulation of buildings, I am informing the House that I will also shortly be laying regulations to repeal unnecessary fire provisions in 23 Local Acts. The decision has been taken in the light of previous consultation which found no evidence to justify maintaining requirements which go beyond the necessary protection already afforded nationally through the building regulations, and lead to differing and inconsistent rules even within fire and rescue authority areas. Evidence does not establish any statistically significant impact on life safety. These changes are intended to come into force on 9 January 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be placing the revised guidance in the Approved Documents referred to above, along with the impact assessments that accompany all of these changes, in the Library of the House when they are published shortly and alongside the summary of responses that I am placing there today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Town and Country Planning Association conference speech</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;England is famous for the beauty of its landscapes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Yorkshire Dales to the South Hams, from the Weald of Kent to the Cumbrian Lakes, England glories in countryside of which generations of man and nature are joint authors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these landscapes - together with the greater drama of their Celtic cousins - that draw visitors to these islands.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these landscapes that our most popular institution and your sister organisation, the National Trust, was set up to preserve in perpetuity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of England is its finest asset and, for each of us, our most precious inheritance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a conservative in both name and spirit, as a West Country boy and a Lincolnshire MP, as the son of a former director general of the National Trust and the brother of 1 of its conservation managers, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that nothing would do more to improve the health and happiness of the British people than if more of them got to spend more of their lives surrounded by beauty.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beauty lifts, calms, excites, inspires.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is more intoxicating than any narcotic, more soothing than any therapy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Britain becomes more prosperous, we must insist that it becomes more beautiful as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the beauty we seek, and the landscapes we treasure, are not only to be found in our open spaces.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the loveliest scenery in Britain is to be found in our villages, cities and towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to take you on a journey, which starts in my constituency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, the river Welland has snaked its way through the low contours of Lincolnshire from its source in Northamptonshire’s Hothorpe Hills.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It enters Lincolnshire at the point where 4 counties meet and passes through countryside that is pleasant but hardly memorable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wandering painter or poet would not give this stretch of the Welland valley a second look, were it not for the landscape of Lincolnshire limestone that is the town of Stamford.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford is not just 1 of England’s most beautiful towns; it is 1 of its finest bits of scenery.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man-made. Built from stone and timber frames and slate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the aesthetic equal of our most splendid hills, lakes and rivers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where did this landscape come from?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did it spring fully formed from the mind of some 17th century master planner, the brainchild of a Lincolnshire Haussman?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford is, as the Royal Commission for Historic Monuments pronounced, ‘a town of discrete buildings’, each 1 unique. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earls of Exeter from nearby Burghley House provided long leases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the local community of wool, leather, cloth and hemp merchants, apothecaries and solicitors indulged themselves with a great variety of stone window surrounds, doorways, eaves, corner and chimney details.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did so within a broad set of rules set out in the London manuals of Rome educated James Gibbs but almost always used local architects and builders.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford was the spontaneous product of human initiative, haphazardly executed and totally unplanned, motivated by the desire for profit, the love of God and that age-old urge that keeps makeover shows in business, the desire to make your house nicer than your neighbours’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next stop is north of the border, in Great Britain’s first New Town.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, by contrast, was an example of municipal town planning at its boldest and most inspired.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to the economic stagnation into which Edinburgh had slipped after the Act of Union, in 1752 the Provost, George Drummond, launched an architectural competition to design a new cityscape of wide streets, crescents and squares, featuring symmetrical terraces of town-houses as well as purpose-built shops and public gardens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six year old James Craig won the competition and, in 4 stages between the 1760s and the 1850s, he, Robert Adam, William Chambers and William Playfair all stayed loyal to the original vision and developed their own variations on a Greek revival theme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In building their New Town, Edinburgh’s town councillors not only restored commercial and cultural vigour to Scotland’s capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also created 1 of the most beautiful landscapes in the British Isles.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who can resist the melancholy charm of a walk in the rain around Charlotte Square and through Ainslie Place? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would wager that the Facebook pages of recent visitors to Scotland contain at least as many photographs of Bute House and Moray Place as they do of Loch Lomond or Glencoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Stamford in the early 1600s, and in Edinburgh 150 later, beauty came about as a result of the natural human urge to get together with one’s neighbours to build a place in which it would be a pleasure to live and work, to raise a family and do business.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the same generous set of instincts that, another hundred and fifty years later, inspired Ebenezer Howard to build Letchworth Garden City. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I am skating on very thin ice telling members of the Town and Country Planning Association anything about the Garden City movement, when your association was founded to promote just that.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do want take a moment, as a layman, lacking all planning qualifications, to say why, like the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, I believe that we have so much to learn from Ebenezer Howard and his garden cities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genius of Letchworth, like so many of the most appealing towns and cities, lies as much in the spaces between the buildings as in the buildings themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By resisting the temptation to cram as many houses as possible onto the available land and adopting their golden rule of twelve houses to the acre, Letchworth’s architects, Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin allowed room for the organic intermingling of nature and architecture.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buildings are buttressed by front and back gardens, the roads are lined with broad verges and trees, the town is criss-crossed with footpaths and patchworked with allotments and parks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ebenezer Howard himself put it, “Parks and gardens, orchards and woods, are being planted in the midst of the busy life of the people, so that they can be enjoyed in the fullest measure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letchworth and the other garden cities work as living, breathing urban communities because, as an Ebenezer Howard put it, they combine “the advantages of the most energetic and active town life, with all the beauty and delight of the country.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the way most English people want to live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to find a way to build places like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what has been holding us back?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only been planning minister for a few months but I have observed the debate about housing and planning for over ten years and I think I know what is wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are trapped in a vicious circle.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People look at the new housing estates that have been bolted on to their towns and villages in recent decades and observe that few of them are beautiful.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, not to put too fine a point on it, many of them are pig-ugly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Harrisons Wharf in Purfleet that I visited last week.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure the flats inside are nice enough but they occupy an overbearing and unbroken slab of dismal brickwork that is an insult to the community it borders, cutting it off from a stretch of the River Thames which, in Victorian times, attracted day-trippers from London keen to take a pleasant walk along banks of the river.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since new housing estates are all too often soulless and formulaic, and those who will inhabit them will add to the pressure on local roads, primary school places and doctor’s appointments, existing residents oppose any proposal to build new houses on green field sites, even when the land is of low environmental quality.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities respond to the wishes of local voters by putting too few sites into their local plans. And this drives the cost of development land up to stratospheric levels (roughly £3 million an hectare in the South East and East of England by 2010.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers respond by stuffing as many units as they can onto any site and, in an attempt to make the properties affordable, skimp on room size, architectural features, vernacular materials, communal spaces and landscape design.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, because we don’t build beautifully, people don’t let us build much. And because we don’t build much, we can’t afford to build beautifully. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the coalition, and my personal mission as planning minister, is to help us break out of this vicious circle once and for all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to get back on to that confident, progressive path, which created Stamford, Edinburgh New Town and Letchworth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to build beautiful and affordable places once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have we done to bring this about? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles’ first step, in June 2010, was to scrap John Prescott’s blanket density target of 30 dwellings per hectare and to stop the garden grabbing that was destroying the precious green spaces that make Britain’s cities so pleasant to live in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government then embarked on a root and branch reform of the planning system and the creation of the National Planning Policy Framework. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a mammoth task which had to be masterminded by a minister with a mammoth brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, my predecessor, Greg Clark, is blessed with exactly that - as well as the unfailing patience and politeness required to bring the good ship Reform to dock with most of those interested in planning and development still on board.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Planning Framework establishes a few clear principles, which it is now my job to drive through.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That local councils should take charge of development in their areas by drawing up local plans.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that alongside the power to plan comes the responsibility to provide new houses to meet people’s aspirations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through their local plans, councils must bring forward enough land to meet the objectively assessed housing needs of their area over the next 5 years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they do so, they will be able to protect precious open spaces against speculative development.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Secretary of State and I will back them to the hilt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if they fail to take their responsibilities seriously, the presumption in favour of sustainable development will fill the vacuum and make the vital decisions that they are ducking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the Framework, Grant Shapps introduced the New Homes Bonus, which gives local councils additional money for every new home for which they give planning permission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in what I believe will turn out to be our most revolutionary step, the government launched neighbourhood planning through which villages, parishes and other neighbourhoods can take control of their future and decide for themselves how and where development should take place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be talking more about our ambitions for neighbourhood plans after the Autumn Statement.
So the government has acted to ensure that more land is brought forward for development and that local communities have an incentive to welcome new housing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now for planners, architects and developers, large and small, to seize the opportunity we have created and start designing beautiful places, which local people will welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, on the edge of Bishops Castle in Shropshire, Bob Tomlinson and Carole Salmon set out to create a new, contemporary village, a friendly place that people would want to live.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was The Wintles, 1 of the most exciting and enchanting collection of new houses anywhere in England.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The houses are all different.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are unashamedly contemporary but incorporate vernacular features in a bold and imaginative way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They use a wide range of both natural and manufactured materials and make a priority of the spaces between the buildings (both private and communal) and the planting of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wintles did not get everything right first time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which experiment ever does?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not as integrated into the rest of Bishops Castle as some long-standing residents would like. And, to replicate it on a large scale, one would need to find a way to build houses that are just as beautiful and just as sustainable but cost less to build.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Bishops Castle I believe that the Living Village Trust created a model for our future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of which Ebenezer Howard would be proud.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In which, once again, we build beautiful new urban landscapes full of affordable houses surrounded by green spaces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be our goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012 UK Bus Awards lunch speech</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you also for inviting me along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a pleasure to be here today at my third consecutive UK Bus Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one for every Transport Secretary since I became a Minister at the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I’m lucky enough to be sharing the stage with Jane (Jane Hill – BBC News).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A journalist and a newsreader, a TV anchor and a radio presenter - Jane is one of the country’s most familiar faces and familiar voices.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have it on good authority that Jane is a big fan of Radio 4’s “The Archers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drama come soap opera that seems to have been around forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters that not too many of the public would recognise in the street&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And people living in a make-believe world which critics claim bears little resemblance to everyday life in modern Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might say this all sounds a bit like the House of Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="speaking-up-for-the-bus-industry"&gt;Speaking up for the bus industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I hope I’ve not just been the consistent Ministerial face at the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; - I’ve also tried to be a consistent voice when it comes to speaking up for the bus industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve said it before and I’ll keep on saying it - Britain’s buses matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are a few familiar facts and figures that prove why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bus travel accounts for 63% of all public transport journeys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;last year in Great Britain buses clocked up 5.2 billion passenger journeys &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, as well as contributing more than £2 billion a year to the economy, the bus industry provides 124,000 direct jobs and supports an estimated 83,000 jobs through the supply chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buses also open up access to vital public services such as health and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, they provide a transport link between worker and workplace, with some two and a half million jobs accessed every day by bus, which is more than by all other forms of public transport combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, increasingly, buses are also helping to safeguard our environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, thanks to this government’s “&lt;a href="/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/background-to-the-green-bus-fund"&gt;Green Bus Fund&lt;/a&gt;” we’re seeing more and more low emission buses on our streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buses that emit around 30 per cent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than standard diesel buses and use around a third less fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And earlier this month I was pleased to announce an extra £20 million for what is now the 4th round of the Green Bus Fund, bringing the total support for this initiative to £95 million since its launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted in Greener Journey’s “Buses and Economic Growth Report” not only are buses the backbone of our public transport system, they can also boost economic growth and cut carbon by reducing congestion and replacing car journeys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="an-industry-equal-to-testing-times"&gt;An industry equal to testing times&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This then is an industry that makes a difference. But it’s also an industry that isn’t short of challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt; and concessionary travel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt; I of course recognise that the rate was cut by 20% from April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also think it’s worth remembering that the Government realised the importance of giving you plenty of time to get ready for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why we gave the bus market 18 months advance notice of the change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me say this on the issue of concessionary travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve made sure that bus operators will be reimbursed so that they are “no better and no worse off” by carrying concessionary passengers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, because, we want the processes surrounding this to be as fair as possible, we’ve also speeded up the appeals mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I know that it’s not easy for operators right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluctuating fuel prices and the backdrop of a tough economic climate make these testing times for businesses and families across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest figures show bus patronage was down 0.3% in non-metropolitan areas and while this is unwelcoming it is far from the apocalypse scene commentators were predicting. Indeed overall, bus patronage across England rose by 0.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also pleased to see that 85% of bus passengers are satisfied with their service. And even in the area of lowest satisfaction it was still 79%. I haven’t seen the latest comparable figures for satisfaction with politicians and journalists but I’m told it’s not quite that high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, these may be testing times but, once again, the industry is showing itself to be equal to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="green-light-for-better-buses"&gt;Green Light for Better Buses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I sense a mood of quiet optimism that was especially tangible at the recent 2012 Euro Bus Expo, which I was delighted to open and where I was able to speak with many in the industry.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also know that there is more to do. Now is not the time for the engine to tick over at the bus stop, we have to keep moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why earlier this year I set out my vision for buses in the &lt;a href="/government/publications/green-light-for-better-buses"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; policy document, “Green Light for Better Buses.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that this report will help provide stability in the industry by reforming subsidy, improving competition and Incentivise partnership working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its heart is a shared vision for a bus service that is reliable and flexible, efficient and innovative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One that offers competitive prices and smarter ticketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus service that gives taxpayers real value for money and passengers a travel option they want to use time and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus service that is successful and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus service that people want to use, not one they use because they have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="young-people"&gt;Young People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d argue that one of the best ways to ensure success and sustainability over the long-term is to encourage much greater bus travel among that section of the market that is literally the future of the industry - young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a challenge that cannot be side-stepped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, just this month the Youth Select Committee published its report on “Transport and Young People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That report called for the age at which young people start paying full fares to be set at 18 across England and for the introduction of a national concessionary scheme to provide a discounted bus travel card for those younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I am looking at this report very seriously and I really do want to work with operators, and also local authorities, to improve the deal for our young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as I said, this is a challenge we have to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s think about all the ways we can use bus services to help young people access employment and training opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s make bus travel easy and attractive for young people by building on initiatives like CPT’s  (Confederation of Passenger Transport) excellent “Bus for Us” interactive website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted that, since I launched it, over 80 of the UK’s bus operators are already signed up to “Bus for Us”  - equivalent to 85% of the bus market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to see all operators on board in the near future. There’s room on top for the rest. My message to the remaining 15% is “don’t miss the bus”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also be innovative about the fare deals and the discounts on offer to young people…and the great work done by Trent Barton in this area shows it can be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s deliver some consistency too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, TCA- led youth concessions are offered in 28 TCAs outside London, and a commercial youth concession is available in 80 TCAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are some good things going on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why is it that in some places there are no concessions at all? And how can it be that in one area a 16 year old might get free bus travel while, in another, a 14-year old pays full adult fare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s come together and work together to support our young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, let’s win over the next generation of bus passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pay-tribute-to-all-the-nominees"&gt;Pay tribute to all the nominees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me return to the reason why we are all here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said earlier that I’m proud to be the bus champion in government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m also just as proud of the people and organisations working in the bus industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, this afternoon, we rightly take the time to recognise some of the brightest and the best in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty two categories in this year’s awards: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals and teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities and  operators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cities and shires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small projects and big projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All making today’s shortlist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all with something in common….excellence and achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, these awards show that the hallmarks of your industry are innovation, professionalism and sheer hard work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also show that, at its heart, your industry is all about people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can talk about investment. And we can debate the pros and cons of one policy versus another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, when push comes to shove, it’s the people in the bus industry who make the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the difference because they understand the needs of the travelling public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the difference because they want to provide a first class service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the difference by delivering real improvements on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s who, and what, we are honouring today….and so I pay tribute to all of this year’s nominees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. They do say that making a speech is a bit like having a fight – any fool can start one, the real skill is knowing when and how to end it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I know you’re keen to get on with handing out those awards, so you’ll be pleased to hear that the “when” has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for “how to end it” it simply remains for me to thank you for your hospitality, to thank you for listening and to wish all those waiting to hear if they’ve won the very best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you and hopefully I’ll see you all next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Suffolk Sustainable Transport Forum</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYG7r0lJIaE&amp;amp;feature=share&amp;amp;list=UU8mgf88hO4bbrfta9bcgZuA" title="Suffolk Sustainable Transport Forum"&gt;Suffolk Sustainable Transport Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transcript"&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for inviting me to talk to your forum today. It seems fitting that I should be with you virtually to discuss our collective goals of creating growth whilst cutting carbon at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome the development of the Suffolk Sustainable Transport Forum and the involvement of Hutchison Ports UK, BT and Suffolk County Council. This is a great example of joint working, both across business sectors and also between business and local government. I also understand that the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership is also working across the private and public sector on their Green Economy Pathfinder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low carbon transport plays a key role in the wider drive towards sustainable economic growth, this is as true on the local level as it is on the national and international level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we allocated a new £600 million Local Sustainable Transport funding for local projects which create growth and cut carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will be aware, Suffolk received £5 million for their Lowestoft Local Links project. This package includes improved pedestrian and cycle infrastructure, increased bus services, improvements to transport interchange hubs, enhanced travel planning provisions, and more. I was pleased to visit Lowestoft this time last year and get a sense of how this will be transforming access to and around the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also investing more widely in green public transport, for example through our national programme of rail electrification or the £30 million Green Bus Fund. Each year, every low-carbon bus outside London saves around 22 tonnes of CO2 compared with its diesel equivalent. Anglian Bus Ltd in Suffolk has been awarded £624,000 to fund 13 low carbon buses, and I look forward to seeing these roll out of the garages and on to the roads, they offer a more comfortable, more reliable and much greener experience for bus passengers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses have been closely involved in the planning and delivery of Local Sustainable Transport projects in Suffolk, and indeed across the 96 projects in 77 authorities that are going ahead because of the Fund.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses are doing this because they realise the benefits of an integrated transport system that allows easy access to workplaces; because of the reduced absenteeism that results from employees choosing a more active lifestyle; and because of the transformation of the local urban and rural environments that can result from an increased uptake of sustainable modes of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also showing support by embracing alternatives to travel in their day-to-day office environments. Endorsing the use of technology, such as video speeches and teleconferencing, and supporting greater uptake of flexible working amongst staff can bring about an array of benefits. Reducing business flights and consolidating office space can lead to notable cost savings. And both research and experience have shown that employee productivity and wellbeing can be improved when we take a more flexible approach to the working day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Olympics proved a challenge and opportunity in this regard. Businesses and government understood that transport would be much busier than usual and that change was necessary. So employees came in to work and left for home earlier to escape the rush hour, they hopped on their bikes rather than hopping on the tube to escape the underground, or they stayed home and logged on rather than getting behind the wheel of a car, escaping the office altogether. The result was not just one of the most successful Games in history, but also one where transport was universally praised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the department is also investing more widely in transport infrastructure in the region, for example through the £22 million transport package for Ipswich. This is an innovative and exciting programme of work that will see Ipswich town centre become a thriving sustainable transport hub, and has the potential to transform the way people travel in and around Ipswich. Indeed, residents are already benefiting from new traffic management measures and cycle and pedestrian facilities, facilitating access to Suffolk College.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about providing policies and funding for transport. We also need to invest in relationships. And that is why I  support fora like this which discuss common challenges, build partnerships,  share best practice and generate solutions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thank you for inviting me, and good luck with your work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Biofuels: the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, progress on adoption and the next generation </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the Westminster Energy, Environment and Transport forum for inviting me to speak at your event this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to have the chance to talk to you about the possible next steps on biofuels policy. First though, I want to talk a bit about how we got to where we are today, and in particular about developments over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition government has stuck by its commitment to cut the carbon footprint of road transport by implementing measures which promote the use of renewable energy, including of course biofuels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concerted effort has not only contributed towards the European Renewable Energy Directive and Fuel Quality Directive targets, but also, in the case of sustainable biofuels, to our international obligations on climate change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took an important step towards the goal of truly sustainable biofuels when we implemented the transport elements of the Renewable Energy Directive last December. The introduction of mandatory sustainability criteria means that to benefit from incentives under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (&lt;abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation"&gt;RTFO&lt;/abbr&gt;) biofuels must now, with some exceptions, deliver greenhouse gas savings of at least 35% compared to fossil fuels. They also cannot be sourced from areas of high biodiversity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes we made to the &lt;abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation"&gt;RTFO&lt;/abbr&gt; last year also introduced double counting. This provides a further incentive for biofuels made from wastes and residues, in recognition that these feedstocks are unlikely to compete with food production or contribute to indirect land use change. In the first 4 years of the &lt;abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation"&gt;RTFO&lt;/abbr&gt;, the proportion of biofuels produced from wastes, rather than crops, increased from 12% to 49%.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am confident that we have already made significant progress towards ensuring that biofuels used in the UK are sustainable. Indeed, in my view it is imperative that the UK biofuel industry continues to invest and grow.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to be able to open the Agri Energy biodiesel plant in Bootle in Liverpool this year….a large new investment that will see the collection of wastes turned into biodiesel.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it is vital that we keep seeing profitable investments like this which produce low carbon energy, provide jobs and help us to meet our ambitious carbon reduction targets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while biofuels should be a key means of achieving carbon reduction targets, we also know that some biofuels still carry sustainability risks. We remain very concerned that studies have demonstrated that some biofuels can even produce greater carbon emissions than fossil fuels, particularly when indirect land use change (or &lt;abbr title="indirect land use change"&gt;ILUC&lt;/abbr&gt;) is factored in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have consistently made clear at European level that &lt;abbr title="indirect land use change"&gt;ILUC&lt;/abbr&gt; needs to be addressed urgently to ensure that people can be confident that available biofuels mean genuine &lt;abbr title="greenhouse gas"&gt;GHG&lt;/abbr&gt; savings.  It is very much in the interests of the biofuel industry itself that we reach this point, and do so as soon as we can.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is helpful that the long awaited &lt;abbr title="indirect land use change"&gt;ILUC&lt;/abbr&gt; proposal was adopted and published by the European Commission last month. My officials and I are currently analysing the proposal and its implications.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission’s proposal sets a 5% cap on the level of contribution food-crop-based feedstocks can make to our 10% &lt;abbr title="Renewable Energy Directive"&gt;RED&lt;/abbr&gt; transport target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal also includes additional support for advanced biofuels, seeking to encourage further development in feedstocks which do not compete for food, feed or land.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to ensure that we have a settled policy framework based on good scientific evidence, and I hope that these European developments can move towards this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime though, I genuinely do not believe that setting further short term interim targets can provide the clarity industry continues to demand.  It might give the veneer of certainty over a body of doubt.  Although I fully appreciate that industry needs clarity on future policy to plan investment, it is equally crucial that government’s policy achieves what it is meant to deliver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I have adopted a cautious approach in setting future biofuel targets within the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation.  Better in my view to go slower in a direction that is certain rather than to go fast and have to change direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been too many examples of government moving too quickly forward on a policy which they have later had to pull back on.  Furthermore, industry tells me that it is certainty they want, not an impression of certainty which turns out to be vacuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I can assure you that we will continue to investigate potentially helpful options, such as the advanced biofuels, which I believe offer a real opportunity for investment and growth for the whole economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer term the advancement of the biofuels industry will surely rely on the development and commercialisation of many of these new technologies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also interested in the potential to use biofuels in sectors where, at present, there are limited options to decarbonise…. such as in aviation and &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, I recognise the importance of biomethane made from waste as a sustainable renewable transport fuel, particularly in the heavy goods vehicle sector where there are real market barriers to uptake of low emission technologies such as hybrid, electric and gas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support the use of lower emission &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; technologies, the Department for Transport has made available over £11 million capital funding to trial low carbon lorries and their supporting infrastructure.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13 projects, trialling over 300 vehicles between them, will receive funding towards the cost of low emission &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; technologies.  The funding is also being used to help establish gas refuelling infrastructure.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initiative will increase the number of low carbon lorries on the road but it will also provide vital information on the performance of these vehicles in the real world….something that will help encourage wider uptake of lower carbon lorries and promote the use of biomethane as a sustainable fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also keen to develop this technology for buses, and am doing so through the Green Bus Fund.
Biofuels are of course just 1 part of a wider strategy to encourage growth and cut carbon.  For example, we are also committed to supporting the uptake of ultra low carbon vehicles in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spending Review announced provision of over £400 million to support the development of the ultra low emission vehicle market work to 2015.  This support package includes funding;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for recharging infrastructure  schemes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to promote the uptake of ultra-low emission cars through the Plug-In Car and Van Grants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;of £82 million to support for research and development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition UKH2Mobility was launched last January. This joint undertaking with key industry stakeholders will evaluate the potential for hydrogen as a fuel for ultra low carbon vehicles in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biofuels have become an important part of the UK economy, of our national infrastructure and of efforts to meet our international emission and energy targets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we are focused on ensuring that this national resource is used appropriately and that the full consequences of growing biofuels are considered and assessed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coalition government believes that it is possible both to safeguard the environment and support the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that these goals are not incompatible. Quite the reverse. They are in fact 2 sides of the same coin. You can cut carbon and boost growth and our work with biofuels is proof of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK biofuels industry continues to lead the world in sustainable and renewable fuels and I am proud of the efforts and achievements the industry has made so far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain our lead in this industry and to address barriers to supply, we need to continue to work closely with suppliers and to listen to concerns raised about the social and environmental sustainability of biofuels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way not only will we get the best deal for the industry, the taxpayer and the consumer… we will get the right policies for our the transport sector, the economy and the environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Double boost for carbon cutting buses</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extra £20 million is being made available for the government’s Green Bus Fund Transport Minister Norman Baker has announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in a second boost for low carbon buses Mr Baker has today launched an easy-to-use toolkit to allow local authorities and bus operators to make informed decisions on investing in carbon cutting buses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £20 million funding will be the fourth round of the Green Bus Fund, bringing the total support for this initiative to £95 million since its launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The additional funding has been found from an underspend in the Department for Transport’s budget and those wishing to buy green buses will be able to apply for the round four support this financial year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cutting carbon emissions from transport is not a choice, it is a necessity and that is why I am prioritising green buses and giving operators and local authorities an extra £20 million to deliver on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our new toolkit will be indispensible in allowing those considering investment in low carbon buses to see the advantages for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The new online low carbon bus calculator will make it easier to quickly work out the savings that can be made over time through cheaper running costs and fuel efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details on the bidding process and eligibility will be published soon on the department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new low carbon bus toolkit will help operators and local authorities work out how the finances might stack up, with or without support from the Green Bus Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those wanting to work out how long it will take for a low carbon bus to pay for itself can now go online and use the new calculator which will allow them to quickly work this out using assumptions around capital costs and fuel efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While buses using low carbon technologies tend to be more expensive than conventional buses many are eligible for government support and running costs are usually lower so that, over time, they are actually the more economical choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toolkit launched today will allow councils and operators to see at a glance how quickly they can expect a return on investment in low carbon buses using a variety of carbon saving technologies such as hybrid or electric buses. It also shows operators and local authorities the savings on offer through reduced running costs from low carbon buses compared with running a bus using conventional fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toolkit also allows the user to tailor the calculation of costs to their specific circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/low-carbon-bus-calculator"&gt;toolkit is available&lt;/a&gt; on the department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Round 4 of the Green Bus Fund was launched on the 6 November 2012. Bidding and eligibility guidance for the 4th round will be issued shortly on the Department for Transport website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scotland is holding a separate £3 million competition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The budget for round 4 of the Fund is £20 million with the funding coming from an underspend in the department’s budget.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is the fourth round of the government’s grant. Round one was launched in 2009 and paid up to 100 per cent of the difference, with round two paying up to 90 per cent and round three up to 80 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Further details on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/background-to-the-green-bus-fund"&gt;fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buses funded through the Green Bus Fund are eligible for the Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) Low Carbon Bus incentive of 6p for every kilometre operated in service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Previous rounds of the Green Bus Fund have part funded diesel hybrid buses, which run on a combination of diesel and a battery, fully electric buses and biomethane-fuelled gas buses. Eligibility for the 4th round will be published shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each year, every low carbon bus in London saves around 26 tonnes of CO2 compared with its diesel equivalent, with buses outside London estimated to save around 22 tonnes.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Investment in green buses</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce today that the department is making a further £20 million available to help bus operators and local authorities in England buy low carbon emission buses through a fourth round of the Green Bus Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operators and authorities will be able to bid for a share of this funding to meet the additional up-front cost of purchasing these buses, and we calculate that this will allow for around 300 new low carbon buses to be bought. This investment will aid the department’s overarching objectives of helping to create growth and cut carbon, as well as help to support UK manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guidance document will be published later this month giving more details of how bus operators and local authorities can bid for a share of this fund. Copies of this will be placed at the same time in the libraries of the House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/low-carbon-bus-calculator"&gt;toolkit has also been published today&lt;/a&gt; advising bus operators and local authorities on how quickly they can expect a return from investing in low carbon emission buses.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric vehicle event</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlP0rXy81Q"&gt;Electric Vehicle Event, Adastral Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry not to be able to be with you today at Adastral Park – but delighted to be able to join you in your electric vehicle event today – by video – and offer my support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that Adastral Park has always been a pretty cutting edge sort of place with a [stellar] name to reflect its history of experimentation and innovation – in aeronautics first off, and then as home for British Telecom’s global innovation and development centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, it is emblematic of the kind of advance that is being made now with plug in vehicles – with new models coming to market and an ever-widening network of charge points around the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Source East team have made impressive progress, with partners in the public and private sector, to get this bedded in around the East of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BT charge points are a welcome addition to the network. So too will be Hutchison Ports’ new points at Felixstowe that go into service today – connecting UK’s largest container port to the Plugged In vehicle network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to workplace charge points helps to build the case for people moving to the electric vehicle option and I fully expect that your lead will encourage other companies to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have got a number of electric vehicles on site today. I hope everyone who wants to gets the chance to test them out and feel how they drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another welcome development is Source East and green energy UK’s announcement of their new partnership – which gives Source East members access to discounted green energy for home charging over night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many electric vehicle drivers, that is going to be the routine – delivering major savings on running costs and freedom from fuel forecourt queuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a time of innovation and ground-breaking technology development – much of it happening here in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is giving motorists great new driving opportunities – which will as well help put a significant dent in our carbon emissions and create new opportunities for economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition government is four square behind this. We have made a £400 million commitment, among other things to support grants for plug in cars and plug in vans and to provide funding for Plugged In Places like Source East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you have a very good day and make the most of testing out the new kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Transport, technology and the city of the future speech</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="transcript"&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke_os03ESSg"&gt;Transport, technology and the city of the future speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for inviting me to speak today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I cannot be with you in person, it seems rather apt for me to appear in virtual form, as your conference examines how evolving technologies might be harnessed to create a smarter city. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this theme chimes very closely with an important element of the work I have been driving forward during my time in government: developing a transport system that creates growth and reduces carbon emissions by maximising the role technology plays in changing the way we work and live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of cities has historically been driven by industrial advancements - new engineering techniques, increased transport capability, global business expansion. As our cities sprawled, we responded by building more homes and expanding our transport networks to widen the geographical reach of our economic centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel to work areas stretched, and it is now common for someone to live over an hour, or even two hours, from where they work. This comes with inevitable costs to the environment and employee wellbeing, not to mention the impact on congestion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are now taking a step back. We’re looking at the shape of the world we’ve created, and we’re considering ‘what next’? What will be the next iteration of the ‘modern city’? And how can the UK remain at the forefront of that evolution? People cannot keep travelling further and further, and they most certainly cannot do so while confined by the working hours that tradition, and habit, so often dictate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why the Department for Transport is looking for smart solutions to the traditional problems we’ve faced. Solutions that are low-cost and high-reward. Solutions that help us deliver what we need to, while also ensuring minimal negative impact on the end user. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our biggest city has just shown us what is possible. During this great summer, it wasn’t just the sport that was a major achievement: our already busy transport network in London stood up to an influx of around one million extra daily visitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t just an increase in transport provision that made the Olympics and Paralympics a success. It was also behaviour change. People listened to our messages on the expected demand increase. They thought about how they usually travel. And they adopted changes to make their journeys more enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some people it may have been flexing the hours they worked, or changing their route to avoid the busiest places at the busiest times. For others, it was perhaps walking or cycling part or all of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still others embraced technology. They replaced face-to-face meetings with teleconferences and videoconferences. They worked from unaffected locations, such as an office hub or home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exemplifies the way technology is changing the way we live and work. And it is Expos like this that are at the forefront of the revolution. Telecommunications have become an inextricable part of our offices. Videoconferencing and teleconferencing are becoming commonplace, and working whilst on the move is now the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we are left asking: why can’t every day be like it was during the Games? And the truth is: it can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen some excellent thinking around the city of the future. A recent paper by Microsoft comes to mind, a white paper on the anywhere working city. It introduced the concept of a ‘third space’ - a space between the office and the home where people can connect via technology. Global Action Plan’s ‘Business in motion’ paper examined how technology could reduce our impact on the environment. And Business in the Community’s ways2work campaign connects business leaders with best practice on how businesses can reduce their impact on the transport network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These kinds of sector-led initiatives will surely continue. But where does government fit in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us in the Department for Transport, the priority is integrated infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why government is looking at door-to-door journeys. What does a person need to make their journey from door-to-door both seamless and convenient? What can we do to facilitate and enable that journey? Is it technology? Is it better transport facilities? We are working closely with industry and key stakeholders to develop a strategy that will set the scene for door-to-door journeys into the future. This will enable others to deliver a well-connected, smart and sustainable transport system that works for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smart ticketing technology that we are investing in has the potential to transform the way that passengers think about and pay for travel on public transport. As part of our rail fares and ticketing review, we are looking at how we can use smart ticketing to offer innovative and new ticket types that reflect modern working patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also why we’re supporting the transition to ultra-low emission vehicles. Yes, we are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 1990 levels between 2023 to 2027. But we also recognise that people care about the climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we offer a plug-in car grant and a plug-in van grant to stimulate the market, and help with the upfront costs for those motorists choosing to purchase these ultra-low emission vehicles. We have also committed up to £30 million of match-funding to the plugged-in places programme, supporting the development of plug-in vehicle recharging infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we continue to look at the bigger picture. Through our £600 million Local Sustainable Transport Fund, we asked local authorities to look at sustainable transport within their communities, and consider what would be needed to help create growth and cut carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within central government, we will look at our own internal processes, and consider how we can work better. We will take the lessons we have learned throughout the games, and identify opportunities for long-term change, to maximise efficiency, increase business resilience, and provide the best possible service to the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, ultimately, that is what a smart city is. It’s a city that provides a high quality, integrated, and joined-up experience for those living within it. And I look forward to continuing to play a role in delivering that end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Investing in Future Transport Conference opening speech</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="transcript"&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFoiHF2Kk0c"&gt;Investing in Future Transport Conference opening speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry not to be able to be present at your conference today - but delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words to open this afternoon’s session - focused as it is on the challenge of transport in an urban environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the theme chimes in very closely with the work that I have been pushing forward while I have been in Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell - developing a transport system that creates growth - and cuts emissions. Especially carbon emissions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly how we get around in the future - whether in cities or elsewhere - will have a huge impact on how we achieve these aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around a quarter of UK domestic carbon emissions are from transport - and over 90 per cent of those are from road traffic.M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth pointing out, as did last month’s UK Climate Change Committee report, the good progress being made in reducing emissions from new cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 4.2% reduction between 2010 and 2011, and on track to meet the indicator target for 2020 - 95 grammes of CO2 per kilometre. That is good news. But of course we want to go further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Government has been determined to create the right conditions for the development of the early market for ultra low emission vehicles - ULEVs [youlevs] as they are known. We have made a £400m commitment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year we put in place the Plug-In Car Grant and extended it to vans this year. This has helped generate a step change in the uptake of ULEVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total claims in the first half of this year are more than we saw in the whole of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with new models coming to the market, I expect to see this trend sustained and growing, in line with our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it is the case that people are hardly likely to buy a ULEV if they don’t see the infrastructure needed to use them already in place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the Coalition Government has taken a lead on this with the Plugged In Places programme. And I’m delighted that, as we anticipated, the private sector has now seen the commercial opportunity this presents and come in with really significant investment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further evidence, if any more were needed, that creating growth and cutting carbon are 2 sides of the same coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combined number of private and public sector charge-points now stands at around six thousand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course hydrogen is also one of the options to decarbonise transport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With industry we have set up the UK H2 Mobility project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s looking at the potential for “hydrogen fuel cell” electric vehicles - and what investment would be required to commercialise the technology, including refuelling infrastructure, from 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is good news that London, where there is already a significant level of hydrogen activity, is pitching for a leading role in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as having ULEV responsibilities, my portfolio also covers what’s known as “smarter choices”. Changing the way we travel isn’t just about changing the car we drive or how we deliver goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about thinking differently - even as far as thinking whether on each occasion we need to travel at all, now we are in the age of video-conferencing and other ground-shifting technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Olympics have been like a test bed, stimulating people to try fresh approaches and allowing individuals and organisations to re-engineer how they go about their business. I hope and expect that these changes won’t be a one-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of you here today the focus of interest will be London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And London has certainly been rich with innovation on the transport front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But countrywide, funding made available by the Government, like the £560m Local Sustainable Transport Fund, now increased to £600m, the Green Bus Fund, and funding for the low carbon truck demonstration trial, is helping to spark real innovation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s remember, it is the short-distance local trip where the biggest opportunity exists for people to make sustainable transport choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around two out of every three trips we make are less than 5 miles in length. Many of them could be easily walked or undertaken by public transport, with cycling an increasingly popular option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been determined to help deliver funding to create an environment where people can feel confident about cycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some really good projects going on around the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am not complacent in the least about any of this. There are huge challenges in transport, not least in terms of air quality where there is still much to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Fuel Quality Directive Transposition response to the comments received in the consultation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I am publishing our response to the comments received in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-04/"&gt;consultation on our proposals to implement Articles 7a to 7e of the EU Fuel Quality Directive (Directive 98/70/EC as amended by Directive 2009/30/EC)&lt;/a&gt;. The Directive requires suppliers to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas intensity of many transport fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response sets out our decision to introduce new secondary legislation to transpose requirements of the Fuel Quality Directive, including new annual reporting requirements for fossil fuels and biofuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document also details our commitment to amend the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 (“RTFO Order 2007”) to include fuels used in non-road mobile machinery, a policy already announced to the House on July 16 when the Department published a related consultation response (Official report, 16 July 2012, Column 112WS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An amendment made in December 2011 to the RTFO Order 2007 means that only biofuels meeting minimum sustainability criteria count towards renewable energy targets. Sustainable biofuels play an important role in our efforts to tackle climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. However, concerns remain about the sustainability of some biofuels, especially around the issue of indirect land use change (“ILUC”) and we are pressing the European Commission and other Member States to produce a robust method to address this issue. Pending that clarity we are taking a cautious approach to implementing the Fuel Quality Directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fuel Quality Directive introduces the requirement for many transport fuel suppliers to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuels they supply by 6% in 2020. We will not impose on suppliers a greenhouse gas reduction obligation at this point. Instead, we will place an ongoing legal duty on the Secretary of State to propose any further measures necessary to ensure delivery of the requirements of the Fuel Quality Directive. We will rely on the amended RTFO Order 2007 to deliver the greenhouse gas savings necessary under the Fuel Quality Directive for the period up to 2014. We will also put in place a requirement for fuel suppliers to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of both the biofuel and fossil fuels they supply for use in land-based transport and for the associated uses listed in the Directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach allows us to transpose the Fuel Quality Directive at the minimum cost to UK business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank all those who took the time to respond to the consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Abolition of regional strategies</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the Government’s policy to revoke existing regional strategies outside London, reflecting manifesto commitments made by both Coalition parties in the 2010 general election and subsequently incorporated into the Coalition Agreement. The Localism Act 2011 provides for the abolition of regional strategies in a two-stage process. The first stage, to remove the regional planning framework and prevent further strategies from being created, took effect when the Localism Act received Royal Assent on 15 November. The second stage would be to abolish the existing regional strategies by secondary legislation. However, any final decision on this must take account of assessments of, and consultation on, the possible environmental effects of revocation of each of the existing regional strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Environmental Assessment process is set out in an EU Directive (Directive 2001/42/EC). In March 2012, the European Court of Justice issued a significant ruling on the interpretation and application of the Directive (Inter-Environnement Bruxelles ASBL &amp;amp; Others v Government of the Brussels-Capital Region).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, and before the decision of the European Court of Justice, there has already been consultation with the statutory consultation bodies on the scope and level of detail of the environmental reports. Public consultation took place between October 2011 and January 2012 on the basis of environmental reports published in October 2011. Detailed responses were provided in the course of this exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the decision of the European Court of Justice, in the light of planning policy and legislation that have been put in place since January 2012, in light of the earlier consultation responses, and in order to be meticulous in observing the requirements of the Directive, the Government is now updating the environmental reports and undertaking additional consultation. We are publishing the first of the updated environmental reports: the report in respect of the proposed &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/strategic-environmental-assessments"&gt;revocation of the East of England Regional Strategy&lt;/a&gt; shortly and will place a copy in the Libraries of both Houses. This report builds on and is intended to supersede the previous report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period for consultation responses will remain open for eight weeks. We welcome and encourage all interested parties to respond. At the end of that period we will consider all consultation responses, including those already submitted during the October 2011 to January 2012 response period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks my Department will publish updated environmental reports relating to the proposals on each of the other regional strategies, so that those proposals too can be the subject of additional consultation. In each case there will be an 8 week period for consultation responses. All updated environmental reports will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses as they are published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed revocation of the Regional Strategies may be regarded as a material consideration by decision makers when determining planning applications and appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In respect of plan-making, the National Planning Policy Framework implementation period provides councils with the incentive to get their plan policies up to date and in doing so they can have regard to the policy to revoke Regional Strategies and the new National Planning Policy Framework policies. A local plan document must be in general conformity with the regional strategy at the stage that the plan is submitted for examination but it is open to councils when preparing local plans to take account of the policy to revoke up to the time of submission. Local authorities can also bring forward proposals (for example on housing targets) which have a local interpretation to them in their plans, based on their own sound evidence base where that is justified by the local circumstances. That evidence base is likely to be more up to date than that included in the Regional Strategies. Each case will depend on its particular facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Fuel Quality Directive Transposition</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I am publishing our &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-05/"&gt;response to the comments received in the consultation on our proposals to expand the scope of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation Order 2007 to include non-road mobile machinery.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fuel Quality Directive (articles 1 and 7a(2)) requires that suppliers of fuels used in non-road mobile machinery should be obliged to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas intensities of the fuels they supply. Our preferred approach for implementing this requirement of the Directive is to amend the current RTFO Order 2007. However, given concerns about the sustainability of some biofuels, it is important that this change does not at this point result in an increase in the absolute volume of biofuel supplied in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, following concerns raised during consultation on engine compatibility and storage issues relating to biofuel used in non-road mobile machinery, we have, as announced previously, delayed making this change immediately so as to give industry and transport users time to prepare in terms of infrastructure and information. The requirement will come into force in April 2013. We understand the need for gas oil users to have accurate information on biofuel content. We hope the delay will give them time to engage with gas oil suppliers to ensure that biofuel-free gas oil will be available. DfT guidance on improving the flow of information between non-road mobile machinery users and fuel suppliers is available at the following link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank all those who took the time to respond to the consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video speech by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuXBgj0PvOg"&gt;Bikeability&lt;/a&gt;
## Transcript&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, I’m sorry that I can’t be with you at your conference today, but thanks to video technology, I’m delighted to be able to make a contribution to this important event to mark the first conference for the Association of Bikeability Schemes, or TABS as you are commonly referred to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition government wants to encourage people to make more journeys by sustainable, carbon-friendly modes of transport, of course including cycling. Cycling brings many benefits, and as a government we are keen to encourage its uptake as a healthy and enjoyable transport choice for the individual, which also helps to ease congestion and cut carbon for society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/bikeability/"&gt;Bikeability&lt;/a&gt; plays a crucial role in both encouraging and enabling individuals to cycle and it is important that the next generation of cyclists is well prepared with the skills and confidence to ride safely and well on modern roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to ride a bike is not just about safety - although that’s important - it’s also a life skill. It’s about gaining independence and broadening knowledge of your environment. Exploring and getting to know your local area by bike was a part of growing up for me, as it happily is for many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can well remember the excitement I got when my dad provided me with my first bike when I was a young lad back in Aberdeen and the freedom it gave me to cycle round the streets of the town and exploring places I had never been to before. I also recall my father arranging for a police officer to come and give me cycling proficiency training in my back garden, something I found intimidating at the time but I think it stood me in good steed ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recall my first day in the Department for Transport, when I asked my civil servants how it was possible to get from the department to the House of Commons for a vote given that it took ten minutes or so to walk over and the division bell gives you eight minutes to arrive. I found the answer was to have a chauffeur waiting downstairs with a car, no doubt with the engine running, that’s been now stopped. I now have use of the departments Brompton which gets me across to the House of Commons in speedy time when neccessary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ministerial colleagues and I firmly believe in the value of cycle training, especially for children. That’s why we have committed to fund Bikeability for the remainder of this parliament to ensure that many more thousands of children will receive the solid grounding to set them up as lifelong cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 11th April, I was also delighted to confirm that as well as the £11m of grants agreed for this year, a further £24m will be allocated by the Department for Transport over the following two years. This includes an extra £2m to support expansion of the scheme on top of money originally earmarked for Bikeability. Additional local contributions worth an estimated £11.5m are expected over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also pleased to be enabling the delivery of a wider range of training to a broader age range of school children between years 5 and 9. Level 1 and 2 training are a good start and lay the foundations but Level 3 can give the budding cyclist the skills and confidence to carry on growing and to ride on all roads where cycling is permitted. That’s why we have loosened the grant rules to allow Level 3 training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Bikeability simply wouldn’t exist without the dedication of the many instructors and Bikeability schemes. It may of course be a wonderful job on a bright sunny afternoon, but I’m equally aware it can be less wonderful on a cold, wet, windy morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bikeability celebrated its 5th birthday in March and I think it’s important to celebrate what we together have achieved. Initially there were around 18 local authorities delivering fewer than 8,000 training places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now offer grants to 108 Local Authorities and 65 School Games Organiser Host Schools. Current &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; funding levels make it possible for at least 275,000 pupils to be trained every year and we expect to see the 1 millionth pupil trained before the end of this parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind this success are over 6000 registered national standard instructors and more than 360 Bikeability schemes delivering training nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stage in Bikeability progression is the cycle training industry organising its own industry body, something I am very pleased to see. This marks an important step in the maturing of the industry and it will be useful to us to be able to hear your collective voice through TABS. Thank you for being involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as providing a voice for the industry, we recognise the important role TABS can play in supporting and maintaining quality assurance. It’s important we get this right so that we remove the obstacles for those who are hesitant to take part in cycling, either for themselves or for their children. We also know that it can be difficult to get into secondary schools for all sorts of reasons, but we hope with your persistence, this can change over time too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why quality assurance is so important: people have to believe that Bikeability is delivered to a uniformly high standard and that their children are getting professional, well-delivered training. We know standards are high, but we all need to keep striving for continual improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; we have a big part to play in other areas too. Making drivers more aware of cyclist needs, improving road design, making cycling a normal part of the transport mix, these are all things we can help with and which we are actively working on. Local councils have their part to play in this agenda too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bikeability is a success. The UK is ahead of other nations in this area. We should be proud of this, but not complacent. But I know that TABS can help make what is already good even better. That is your challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thanks go to TABS for putting together this excellent event. I am looking forward to working with you to ensure the continued delivery of high quality cycle training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening to me and I wish you a great conference.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next steps to improve the planning system and support sustainable development</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further moves to simplify the planning system and make it more accessible to people in communities were set out today by Planning Minister Greg Clark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package of measures includes proposals to make it easier to re-use some existing buildings without needing planning permission including the so-called ‘meanwhile’ use of vacant commercial buildings; streamlining the amount of paperwork needed for a planning application; speeding up planning appeal decisions; reducing the volume of planning guidance; and ensuring planning departments are properly resourced to assess applications promptly and efficiently, reducing the burden on council taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has already taken steps to improve the planning system through the National Planning Policy Framework and the Localism Act, which are already delivering results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the rate at which councils are putting in place a local plan is increasing in comparison to the average over the previous seven years and over 100 local authorities are now working with front-runner communities on neighbourhood planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s proposals will help to maintain the rapid pace of reform by removing unnecessary barriers, streamlining paperwork, and supporting swifter decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Clark said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our reforms to the planning system are making it simpler, clearer and more accessible to people in communities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Following the simplification of the national planning policy in the National Planning Policy Framework, these proposed changes streamline the process of applying for planning permission.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our aim is to have a system that applicants and members of communities can be confident will give a reliable, swift and fair outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making it easier to re-use existing agricultural, retail and commercial buildings, such as offices and warehouses, without the need to submit a planning application, supporting small business growth. A consultation is being published on changes to the Use Classes Order, which determines the flexibility with which such buildings can be re-used. The consultation also proposes allowing so called ‘meanwhile’ or temporary uses of certain buildings to open up premises to new businesses and to bring redundant buildings back into use, in line with recommendations in the Portas Review.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cutting out unnecessary information in the application process to make the system clearer, and easier to use, without undermining the ability for councils to make well-informed decisions. A consultation setting out proposals is being published today.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Following the approach of the National Planning Policy Framework in distilling 1,000 pages of policy into around 50, the next challenge is to review around 6,000 pages of supporting planning guidance. Details of the approach to be taken will be announced shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speeding up the process for determining planning appeals - proposals on shortening and streamlining the process will be published for consultation later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uprating local councils’ planning fees in line with inflation thereby reducing the burden on ordinary council taxpayers, who otherwise end up subsidising developers. Planning fees are set by Government and have not been increased since 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring councils whose planning decisions are consistent with an up to date local plan are not ordinarily liable for costs if their decision is appealed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making technical changes to the operation of the Community Infrastructure Levy including ensuring that developers are not charged the levy twice, on the same development, if they amend existing planning consent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extending the funding to April 2013 to the four organisations providing advice and support to communities leading the way on neighbourhood planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A consultation paper on allowing greater permitted development rights in changing between Use Classes is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reusebuildingsconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reusebuildingsconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A consultation paper setting out a range of proposals to streamline the information requirements for planning applications is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/streamlininginfoconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/streamlininginfoconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy allows local authorities in England and Wales to raise funds from owners or developers of land undertaking new building projects in their area. The money can be used to fund a wide range of infrastructure that is needed as a result of development, including new or safer road schemes, flood defences, park improvements, green spaces and leisure centres. The Government will introduce regulatory changes in the Autumn to improve the operation of the levy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government is proposing to improve the performance of statutory consultees in the planning process by ensuring that there is an effective mechanism for applicants to obtain an award of costs where a statutory consultee has acted unreasonably. A consultation with detailed proposals is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/statutoryconsulteeconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/statutoryconsulteeconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The four organisations providing support on neighbourhood planning are: the Royal Town Planning Institute; the Prince’s Foundation for Building Community; the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England working with the National Association of Local Councils and Locality (the Building Communities Consortium). The further funding will be available until the end of the financial year to enable the four support providers to offer practical and bespoke advice and assistance to those communities leading the way with their neighbourhood plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>£266 million investment in local sustainable transport schemes</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce today that I am awarding a further &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/local-sustainable-transport-fund-guidance-on-the-application-process/"&gt;£266 million to support authorities in delivering local economic growth whilst cutting carbon emissions&lt;/a&gt; from transport. This funding unlocks further local funding sources to deliver £460 million investment in local sustainable transport schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement is the third and final instalment of the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, which is now delivering over £1 billion investment in sustainable travel across England, and demonstrating that economic growth and carbon reduction go hand in hand. To facilitate today’s announcements, I have secured an additional £40 million for the Fund, on top of the original £560 million allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 20 December 2011, the department received 13 business cases for Large Projects for the Local Sustainable Transport Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decided to announce £225 million for 12 large projects today, and I have also reserved up to £5 million funding for a small project from Tyne and Wear &lt;abbr title="Integrated Transport Authority"&gt;ITA&lt;/abbr&gt;, which my officials will progress with officers from Tyne and Wear during the coming weeks. The list of decisions made today regarding large projects is attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24 February 2012, the department received 53 small project bids to Tranche 2. On 24 May 2012 I announced £113 million to fund 30 small projects, and I am today committing a further £41 million to fund 15 more. The list of decisions made today regarding the remaining Tranche 2 bids is also attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased that every single eligible local authority across England has applied for funding to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, either as a lead bidder, or as a partner authority to a large project. The fund has been well received by local government and I am confident that it will be effective in addressing the two key objectives of creating growth and cutting carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All projects were assessed against published criteria. Successful projects were those judged to perform well against the twin objectives of supporting the local economy and facilitating economic development, while reducing carbon emissions. They also demonstrated potential to deliver wider social and economic benefits, to improve safety, to bring about improvements to air quality, or to promote increased levels of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All large projects included a full economic appraisal based on the department’s WebTAG guidance. The vast majority of funded large projects offer at least high value for money, with several offering very high value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>£266M transport boost for green growth and infrastructure </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towns and cities across England are set to benefit from major transport schemes boosting green growth, Transport Minister Norman Baker announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding forms the third allocation from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/local-sustainable-transport-fund-guidance-on-the-application-process/"&gt;12 major projects have won funding totalling £225 million, while 15 smaller schemes are receiving a total of £41 million&lt;/a&gt; from the Department for Transport. This includes an additional £40 million on top of the previously- announced £560m funding available under the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This central funding will be matched by a further £194 million funding from local authorities and businesses, bringing the total value of the schemes to £460 million. Since the Local Sustainable Transport Fund was created following the General Election of 2010, almost a hundred schemes have benefitted from more than £1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schemes announced today are led by 24 local authorities, with many more as partners and cover eight regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the projects will provide a transport package that delivers carbon savings and economic growth, and in many cases will see major investment in local transport infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successful schemes include a variety of measures including improving sustainable transport options for commuters, encouraging parents and children to walk to school, creating public transport hubs and building better cycling infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The schemes we are funding will improve life for millions of people in towns and cities up and down the country and show that cutting carbon and boosting economic growth go hand-in-hand.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Investing in these schemes shows that we are serious about funding infrastructure where there is a clear business case for doing so. The money we are putting into these projects will unlock much greater economic benefits for communities as well as improving the environment - it’s a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schemes to be funded include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading will see a real boost for bikes, including a London-style cycle hire scheme and a new state-of-the-art pedestrian and cycle bridge crossing the Thames. There will also be new park-and-ride schemes and improvements to existing schemes to help commuters access key employment hubs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merseyside will see a project providing better public transport and cycle infrastructure, linking areas of deprivation with areas of employment. The scheme will include real-time travel information and extra services for bus users as well as station improvements on the local rail network.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nottingham will see its smartcard scheme expanded to cover all of the city’s buses, trams and trains with more outlets offering top up services for the cards. The funding will also cover cycle storage and hire schemes, as well as a network of local travel hubs set up to address the specific travel needs of different communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full list of the successful bids can be found below. All the schemes for which funding has been confirmed today are also receiving significant contributions from the local council or the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These local schemes will bring national benefits. In addition to supporting economic growth, enabling and encouraging people to make more sustainable travel choices, the projects will reduce delays on the roads in urban areas, which cost the economy around £11 billion a year. These projects will help tackle problems such as poor air quality, and improved cycling and walking infrastructure will help to improve the health of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Further projects approved for the Local Sustainable Transport Fund</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce today that the department is awarding a further £112.94 million to support authorities in delivering local economic growth whilst cutting carbon emissions from transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24 February 2012, the department received 53 bids to Tranche Two of the Local Sustainable Transport Fund from 48 lead authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals were assessed against the criteria as published in the Guidance on the Application Process, which was published on 19 January 2011. Successful proposals were those judged to perform well against the twin objectives of supporting the local economy and facilitating economic development, while reducing carbon emissions. They were also scored on their potential to deliver wider social and economic benefits, to improve safety, to bring about improvements to air quality, or to promote increased levels of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals were required to demonstrate financial sustainability with benefits enduring beyond the life of the fund, to incorporate a credible delivery plan, and to include a commitment to make a local contribution towards the overall costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with the published guidance, an assessment of value for money was undertaken. The department is confident that the overall package of proposals approved in this second round represents high value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decided to announce funding for 30 proposals in this round today, with a further announcement regarding the status of 18 more bids to be made soon. 26 proposals will be funded in full and a further 4 proposals will be funded in part. The list of decisions made today regarding Tranche 2 bids is attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 20 December 2011, the department received 13 business cases for larger projects (requiring up to £50 million funding from &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;). I intend to announce by the end of June which of those authorities have been successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased that all eligible local authorities across England have applied for funding to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, either as a lead bidder, or as a partner authority to a large project. The fund has been well received by local government and I am confident that it will be effective in addressing the two key objectives of creating growth and cutting carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Green growth gets £113 million transport boost</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 carbon cutting, growth boosting local transport schemes were given the green light today by Transport Minister Norman Baker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projects have won funding totalling £113 million as part of the second allocation from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. They are led by 29 English local authorities with many more as partners and cover eight regions. All projects are designed to create a sustainable transport package that delivers economic growth and reduces carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successful schemes include a variety of measures including improving sustainable transport options for commuters, creating public transport hubs, building better cycling infrastructure and even providing a new ferry service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The schemes we are funding today will benefit communities from Devon to Durham by cutting carbon emissions, reducing congestion and stimulating economic growth in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By investing in these projects we are signalling our commitment to green growth which will help to kick-start economic activity in local areas while improving access to healthier forms of transport and addressing the problem of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schemes to be funded include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Smarter Travel Slough&lt;/strong&gt; which will reduce congestion on main roads in the rush hour by increasing the use of walking, cycling and public transport. This will improve air quality and health while supporting business efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Walk to School Outreach&lt;/strong&gt; will see Durham County Council working with national charity Living Streets and eight other councils to increase the number of children walking to school in 854 primary and 182 secondary schools nationally. The project aims to reduce congestion and improve health through exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Travel Torbay Regeneration Project&lt;/strong&gt; will deliver a new fast ferry service between Torbay and Brixham which will see journey times cut by half, a new cycle route to encourage more low carbon journeys and a supporting package of employer based travel planning to help increase use of public transport.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Access to Jobs, Training and Services in Stafford&lt;/strong&gt; will aim to reduce congestion at peak times in Stafford by improving access to walking, cycling and public transport. People will be encouraged to reconsider their travel habits through offers of discounted bus travel and a new mobile cycle centre providing cyclists with information and advice as well as selling reconditioned bikes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sustainable Transport Access to Tourism on the Isle of Wight&lt;/strong&gt; will improve the island’s sustainable transport network to support its bid to become a leading destination for green tourism. This will include the provision of transport hubs and easily-accessible live travel information to help visitors and local people plan their journeys. Walking and cycling routes will also receive a boost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full list of the successful bids can be found below. All the schemes for which funding has been confirmed today are also receiving contributions from the local council or the private sector. In total, the £113 million provided by DfT is allowing more than double that amount to be invested in these important projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These local schemes will bring national benefits. In addition to supporting economic growth enabling and encouraging people to make more sustainable travel choices, the projects will reduce delays on the roads in urban areas, delays which cost the economy around £11 billion a year. They will also help tackle problems such as poor air quality and improved cycling and walking infrastructure will help to improve the health of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today’s announcement relates to schemes seeking contributions from the Department of less than £5 million. Large projects which have been allocated funding of more than £5 million from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund will be announced by the end of June 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For every £1 of DfT funding provided for these schemes, £1.19 is being contributed by local authorities and other partners.&lt;/li&gt;
