    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its accountability framework for policy performance, the Government has made an ongoing commitment to publish the indicators as set out in Departmental Business Plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This information could previously be found within the MOD’s Quarterly Data Summaries (QDS), however it will now be published directly here, and can be accessed using the links below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indicators will be published annually, but we will provide quarterly updates whenever possible. We will also look to provide visualisations for all indicators in future, once more data is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Joint Concept Note 2/12: Future Land Operating Concept</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joint Concept Note (JCN) 2/12: Future Land Operating Concept is founded on the uncompromising requirement for Land forces to excel at warfighting. Deterring conflict will remain a central pillar of UK security policy and a crucial role for Land forces. The credibility of deterrence depends on political will and the capability to defeat the gravest threats. Accordingly, the Land force must be configured to defend robustly and, if deterrence fails, be ready to apply decisive lethal force to set the conditions for political progress. The Land force must have the ability to intervene, in concert with the other Services, to fight and win the nation’s wars.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sources of competition, confrontation and conflict are increasing and will continue to drive a requirement for the Land force to provide political choice in the defence of the UK’s vital national interests.  Therefore, the Land force must maintain a credible and demonstrable persistent capacity to defeat adaptive, hybrid adversaries, predominantly amongst the population, on ground and with methods of their choosing and have the capability to secure resources and people. This decisive warfighting effect also underpins the credibility required to operate with partners and allies, and serves to reinforce our influence internationally, thereby increasing political options. Credible ‘hard power’ provides the foundation of ‘soft power’; Defence Engagement makes a key military contribution to this. The Land force’s contribution to Defence Engagement is instrumental in providing textural understanding, capacity-building, reassurance and influence in support of building stability overseas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capability to conduct demanding, decisive combat operations and contribute to Defence Engagement requires both an adaptable and integrated approach: both themes are threaded throughout this concept.  This approach also supports the contribution of the Land force (as part of the Joint force) to UK resilience.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FLOC articulates the three new roles for the Army; Contingent Capability for Defence and Deterrence; Overseas Engagement and Capacity-Building; UK Engagement and Homeland Resilience. Finally, this Land capstone concept also recognises that the future application of the Manoeuvrist Approach will have to account for a range of audiences and actors within, adjacent to, and dislocated from the areas of operations. Manoeuvre itself will be about seeking to gain advantage over an opponent in the information domain as well as the traditional dimensions of fire and movement combined with air power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Joint Concept Note 1/12: Future 'Black Swan' Class Sloop-of-War: A Group System</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this Joint Concept Note is to act as a catalyst for a conceptually led change to both the procurement and the employment of future maritime capabilities with investment in systems not platforms.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future ‘Black Swan’ class sloop-of-war is a manned ship that will act as the core for a group of manned and unmanned platforms which, as an integrated system, will provide the units of power required by those surface assets tasked with the protection of Sea Lines of Communication and sea control. At an acceptable financial cost, operating in groups, the sloops will provide both the quantity of platforms and the quality of systems that will be demanded of the Royal Navy in the future operating environment. In operations other than war, the increased hull numbers will provide the capabilities required to fulfil the maritime security tasks demanded by a maritime nation as well as the global presence required to engage with the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name of the concept is drawn from the ‘Black Swan’ and modified ‘Black Swan’ class sloop-of-war, which were built during World War II to protect shipping and gain sea control. Like this concept, the key to the tactical proficiency of the sloops was not the single ship but rather the ‘group system’ with capability measured collectively in groups rather than individually in single platforms. The most famous of these being Captain Johnnie Walker’s 2nd Support Group, which - comprising of six ‘Black Swan’ class sloops - was the most successful anti-submarine group of the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Joint Doctrine Note 2/12: Assessment</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joint Doctrine Note (JDN) 2/12: Assessment is a collaborative endeavour between the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) and the UK Stabilisation Unit (SU). It introduces key messages and top tips for assessment (or monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the JDN is to reinforce existing doctrine and to inform its development, and that of future doctrine. It promotes an integrated and consistent approach to assessment within a stabilisation environment. It draws from a range of communities the emerging and developed assessment theory and practice. The JDN addresses how to assess progress towards national goals, and how to exploit information in order to inform campaign decision-making. By adopting an integrated approach, this JDN offers a consistent and comprehensive assessment methodology. Finally, it is structured to supplement military doctrine on campaign assessment.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JDN 2/12: Assessment  is written primarily for those decision-makers, planners and analysts, military or civilian, involved in integrated campaign planning at the strategic and operational levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Multinational Experiment 7: Space: Dependencies, Vulnerabilities and Threats</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multinational Experiment 7 (MNE7) examines a number of issues relating to access to the global commons across the space, maritime and cyber domains.  As lead for one of the space objectives, DCDC has, with DSTL, produced a handbook on space dependencies, vulnerabilities and threats.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handbook also acts as a mini space primer, describing: why space is different; why the type of orbit a satellite is in is important and what capabilites space systems can deliver.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the handbook describes a simple methodology for conducting a survey of space dependency across a state’s critical national infrastructure.  It also details eight case studies, illustrating how space is used in a range of military and civilian situations, to assist the reader in understanding where their own dependencies may lie.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCDC is the UK lead for Multinational Experiment 7 (MNE7), a collaborative effort involving more than 20 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
