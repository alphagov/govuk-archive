    <title>The Foreign Office's Human Rights work in 2011</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government welcomes the attentive scrutiny of its human rights work during 2011 carried out by the Foreign Affairs Committee. The Government agrees with the FAC’s assessment that the UK has a strong record in upholding human rights across the world. We welcome the FAC’s comment that our Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy for 2011 provides ample evidence of our work in promoting higher standards of human rights abroad, sometimes in difficult circumstances. We were pleased that the FAC recognise the considerable effort that went into the production of the FCO’s Annual Human Rights Report for 2011. We have taken steps to strengthen our human rights reporting over the last two years in response to direction from Ministers and feedback from the FAC and others. We will continue to ensure that our reporting is targeted to meet the needs of Parliament and our national and international readership.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Command Paper sets out the Government’s response to the Foreign Affairs Committee’s report of 17 October 2012 into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s Human Rights Work in 2011. The Committee’s recommendations are set out in bold. Unless otherwise indicated, references are to paragraphs in the Foreign Affairs Committee Report (HC116).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The human right to water and sanitation </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK recognises a right to water and a right to sanitation as elements of the right to an adequate standard of living in Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has recognised sanitation as a human right under international law and has committed to doubling ambitions on water, sanitation and hygiene to reach at least 60 million people by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government issued a statement in June 2012, setting out details of the right to sanitation as recognised by the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK government strategy on the protection of civilians in armed conflict</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During armed conflict, civilians often pay a heavy price. They may face daily threats of violence and death as they find themselves 
inadvertently caught up in the middle of a conflict. Despite being protected under international humanitarian and human rights law, civilians continue to be the victims of violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy paper sets out the actions the UK Government sees as necessary to help protect civilians in armed conflict, building on work that is already going on in the UK and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
