    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) is a loan guarantee scheme to facilitate additional lending to viable small and medium size enterprises lacking adequate security or proven track record for a normal commercial loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme was launched in January 2009 to facilitate additional lending to viable businesses lacking adequate security or proven track record for a standard commercial loan. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over 19,700 SMEs have been offered EFG loans with a total value in excess of £2 billion. 
EFG is a demand led scheme complimentary to commercial lending – not a replacement. EFG accounts for 1% to 2% of total SME lending.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Businesses that meet the basic eligibility criteria do not have an automatic entitlement to receive an EFG guaranteed loan.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decision making on individual loans is fully delegated to the participating lenders and is integrated with the commercial decision to lend. Where the lender determines the business is viable (able to meet the monthly loan repayments and repay the loan in full) but is lacking adequate security to meet the lenders standard lending requirements, they can consider providing a loan under EFG. The government plays no role in the loan decision process. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government provides the lender with a guarantee for 75% of each individual loan, subject to a cap set by an Annual Claim Limit. The borrower pays a 2% per annum pro-rata premium to BIS as a contribution towards the cost of providing the government guarantee. The borrower is responsible for repayment of 100% of the loan, not just the 25% outside the coverage of the government guarantee. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the case of default, lenders are required to follow their standard commercial recovery procedures, including the realisation of available security before a claim can be made against the guarantee. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Under EFG, lenders are entitled to take security, including personal guarantees. This is standard commercial practice and an established mechanism for ensuring a degree of personal commitment to repayment of the loan by the business. In EFG this means there is a three-way risk sharing between borrower, lender and the government. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lenders are expressly prohibited from taking a charge over a principal private residence for an EFG facility. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="efg-eligibility-criteria"&gt;EFG eligibility criteria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses that meet the basic eligibility criteria do not have an automatic entitlement to receive an EFG guaranteed loan. Eligibility for EFG will be determined by the lender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a guideline only. EFG is open to viable businesses that: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operate in the UK &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have a turnover of up to £41 million &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;are seeking finance between £1,000 and £1million &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;repayment terms from 3 months to 10 years (less for overdraft and invoice finance facilities) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;operate in a sector that is eligible for EFG (most sectors are eligible) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFG is subject to certain sector restrictions arising from the EU de minimis State Aid rules under which it operates. A list of the main sector restrictions is provided in the EFG Business Sectors attachment below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Industrial Development Act 1982 provides the legal basis for EFG. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that neither BIS nor Capital for Enterprise Ltd (CfEL) who oversees the running of EFG on behalf of BIS can advise on individual eligibility queries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="types-of-efg-facilities-available"&gt;Types of EFG facilities available&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following facilities are available under EFG, repayable over a period of 3 months to 10 years unless otherwise stated: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new term loans (unsecured and partially secured) for working capital or investment purposes including R&amp;amp;D. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;refinancing of existing term loans, where the loan is at risk due to deteriorating value of security or where for cash flow reasons the borrower is struggling to meet existing loan repayments. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conversion of part of or all an existing utilised overdraft onto a term loan in order to release capacity in the overdraft to meet working capital requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;invoice finance guarantee providing a guarantee on invoice finance facilities to support an agreed additional advance on a SMEs debtor book, to supplement the invoice finance facility on commercial terms already in place (available for terms up to three years). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;overdraft guarantee providing a guarantee on new or increased overdraft borrowing where the SME is viable but has inadequate security to meet a lender’s normal requirements for the level of overdraft requested (available for terms up to two years). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that participating lenders are under no obligation to offer the full range of products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="application-process"&gt;Application process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses seeking debt finance can approach one or more of the participating lenders shown in the attachment below. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFG loans typically require all the same information that banks need to process a commercial loan application. Participating lenders will advise you of their specific requirements (failure to provide the required information may delay the loan decision or lead to a loan decline). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenders will typically assess loan applications against their standard lending criteria to determine whether they wish to lend. Where the lender determines the business is viable (able to meet the monthly loan repayments and repay the loan in full) but is lacking adequate security to meet the lenders normal lending requirements, they can consider providing a loan under EFG. The government plays no role in the loan decision process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the lender has determined that use of EFG is likely to be appropriate, they confirm eligibility and record details of the borrower and their facility via a secure Web Portal. An overview of the EFG application process is available below.&lt;/p&gt;

          publication ("EFG Backed Loan Application Process").
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses that do not meet the lenders viability requirements are not suitable for EFG. EFG is intended to support lending to businesses which can ultimately repay their loan in full, not prop up unviable businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-government-guarantee"&gt;The government guarantee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing lenders with a government-backed guarantee for 75% of the value of each individual loan, subject to a cap set by an Annual Claim Limit, EFG facilitates lending that would otherwise not take place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guarantee provides protection to the lender in the event of default by the borrower – it is not insurance for the borrower in the event of their inability to repay the loan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The borrower is responsible for repayment of 100% of the EFG facility, not just the 25% outside the coverage of the government guarantee. Where defaults occur, the lender is obliged to follow their standard commercial recovery procedure, including the realisation of security, before they can make a claim against the government guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the costs and fees charged by the lender, businesses supported under EFG are required to pay an additional 2% annual premium which partially covers the cost of providing the guarantee. The premium is assessed and collected quarterly in advance throughout the life of the loan based on the outstanding capital balance of the loan (for invoice finance and overdraft guarantees the premium is assessed on the agreed facility limit). The borrower is provided with a premium schedule by the lender as part of their loan documentation and collection is made by Direct Debit under the description “BIS LOAN GUARANTEE”. The interest rate charged and any other fees and charges applied to the loan are a commercial matter for the lender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="security--personal-guarantees"&gt;Security / personal guarantees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under EFG, lenders are entitled to take security, including personal guarantees. This is standard commercial practice and an established mechanism for ensuring a degree of personal commitment to repayment of the loan by the business. In EFG this means there is a three-way risk sharing between borrower, lender and the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When taking security, lenders are required to apply their normal commercial policies in determining the extent and value of security available. The exception from normal commercial practice is that lenders are expressly prohibited from taking a charge over a principal private residence for an EFG facility. 
A personal guarantee should not be taken or attributed, solely or preferentially to cover the 25% of the EFG loan not covered by the Government guarantee. The borrower is liable for repayment of 100% of the loan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EFG should not be seen by borrowers or their advisers as a mechanism for putting personal assets beyond consideration (principal private residence excluded for the purposes of EFG). If the lender refuses to offer EFG on the basis that the borrower had access to security which they were not prepared to put forward, then the lenders decision would be fully supported by BIS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="enterprise-finance-guarantee-further-help"&gt;Enterprise Finance Guarantee: further help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delivery of EFG, including the decision on whether or not it is appropriate to use it in connection with any specific lending transaction, is fully delegated to the participating lenders. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121017180846/http:/www.capitalforenterprise.gov.uk/" title="Information about Capital for Enterprise Limited"&gt;Capital for Enterprise Limited&lt;/a&gt; oversees the running of EFG on behalf of BIS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="for-lenders"&gt;For lenders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals within a participating lender should contact their central processing team or other designated internal EFG expert who can obtain further information from CfEL if required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="for-businesses"&gt;For businesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses may wish to consider approaching one or more of the participating lenders to discuss their borrowing needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses that have any issues relating to an EFG loan, including premium collection or alterations to their repayment profile, should raise them with their lender and not with BIS or CfEL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that neither BIS nor CfEL will intervene in the commercial relationship between borrower and lender in the event of disputes. Customers dissatisfied with the experience of dealing with their bank should raise their concerns through the bank’s own customer complaints procedure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Employee Ownership and Share Buy Backs - Consultation on implementation of Nuttall Review recommendations</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The Nuttall Review on Employee Ownership recommended (Recommendation V) that the Government should review and consult on changes to deregulate the conditions under which companies can: authorise share buy backs; finance share buy backs; and hold shares ‘in treasury’.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on deregulatory changes to the conditions under which companies can authorise and finance the repurchase of its own shares, and hold these shares once repurchased. The regulation of share buy backs is governed by the Companies Act 2006. Changes to these regulations, such as those proposed in this consultation would require changes via secondary legislation. The draft regulations attached below indicate how the government would implement these changes. Through this consultation we would also like to understand the implications for companies, employees, and other shareholders. In particular we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Approach to Charging</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Part of the government response to the consultation on the data policy for a Public Data Corporation, now known as the Public Data Group (PDG).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government launched a formal consultation on 4 August 2011 to look in detail at key questions on the data policy for a Public Data Corporation, which since the Autumn Statement in November 2011 is now known as the Public Data Group (PDG). The consultation questions focused on: charging, licensing and regulatory oversight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the initial government response to the consultation, published in March 2012, the government committed that it “will continue to consider the options for charging including those set out in the consultation and will report back by the end of 2012.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, based on information supplied by the Public Data Group Trading Funds (Companies House, Land Registry, Met Office and Ordnance Survey) the following slides have been put together to clarify the approach to charging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides provide an overview of the regulatory and guidance framework, the differences between the trading funds which underpin their approach to charging and an overview of the current charging models including reference to some of the work being undertaken to respond to changes in the end markets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Public Data Group’s commitment to ongoing collaborations and sharing of best practice, we will continue to build on this work and focus on developing appropriate frameworks and guidelines to help deliver new charging models relevant to the Public Data Group Trading Funds and their respective markets. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consultation on the repeal of the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is seeking views on the possible repeal of the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 (PMA). The PMA makes it an offence to make false or misleading statements in the course of an estate agency or property development business about property offered for sale. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs) provide similar protections for consumers. This duplication may be unnecessary; putting additional burdens on business, without providing additional protection for consumers. The consultation considers whether the Government should repeal the PMA, now that the CPRs are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK government oil and gas sector strategy: call for industry's views</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its industrial strategy, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (&lt;abbr title="The DEpartment for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;) announced that there will be, initially, 10 sector strategies, of which oil and gas would be one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry’s input is essential as &lt;abbr title="The DEpartment for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (&lt;abbr title="The Department of Energy and Climate Change"&gt;DECC&lt;/abbr&gt;) develop this work in partnership with Oil &amp;amp; Gas UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sector strategies will be co-developed and implemented with industry to be durable and will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be long-term in focus: developing a vision for the sector and what needs to happen from both government and business to get there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be co-created with industry: committing both business and government to specific actions to maintain and develop long-term capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take a whole of government approach: looking across all of government to identify barriers and levers which have the biggest impacts and align these to deliver growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;engage across the totality of the sector: working with industry and identifying actions which benefit business across the whole supply chain whether they are large, medium or small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publication is expected in late March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry’s views are very much welcomed particularly through January 2013 and can be fed into either:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Better choices: better deals. Report on progress on the consumer empowerment strategy</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>This report covers the progress that has been made in the 18 months since the consumer enpowerment strategy was launched. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer empowerment strategy Better Choices: Better Deals was published in April 2011. This progress report describes how the wide range of commitments made then have been taken forward. Many of these have involved two or more of government, businesses, economic regulators, consumer groups and individual consumers coming together to develop practical ways to help empower people to make better choices and get better deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The empowerment strategy established midata, a programme of work involving government, consumer groups and leading businesses to give consumers more control and access to the data that companies hold about them. The aim of the midata programme is to give consumers access to their transaction data in a way that is electronic, portable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
