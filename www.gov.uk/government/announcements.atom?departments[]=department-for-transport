    <title>Cash boost for local roads</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Councils can plan how to spend their share of a £215 million fund for local road maintenance after funding allocations were published today by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £215 million is part of a £333 million fund announced in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement for essential maintenance to renew, repair and extend the life of roads in England.  This funding is in addition to the £3 billion the government is already providing for councils in England between 2011 and 2015 for highways maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This maintenance funding could be used for improvements such as road resurfacing, maintenance to bridges or repairing damage to highway infrastructure caused by severe weather events, such as the recent flooding.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick McLoughlin said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This extra money will support economic growth and development by helping local authorities to get the best out of their local road networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This funding can be spent on measures to bring smoother, safer and more reliable journeys to the travelling public whether they are commuting to work or taking the children to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help local residents see where this money has been spent it will be a condition of the funding that local authorities commit to publishing a short statement on their websites at the end of each financial year setting out what and where this additional funding has been spent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities are also encouraged to look at the information published by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/hmep"&gt;Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme&lt;/a&gt; which is leading the way by bringing together the public and private sectors to develop good practice and reduce costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced in the Autumn Statement on 5 December additional funding of £333 million for highways maintenance for both the motorway and trunk road and local road network. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£215 million additional capital funding will be provided to local highway authorities, including London, to help renew and repair the network in England. £140 million will come in 2013 to 2014, with the remaining £75 million following in 2014 to 2015. The funds will be distributed on the basis of the department’s existing highways maintenance capital funding formula. A &lt;a href="/government/publications/local-transport-capital-block-funding"&gt;full list of the allocations by region and local authority&lt;/a&gt; is available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To be eligible for this additional funding and to promote greater transparency and accountability, the department will require local highway authorities to publish a brief note on their website by the end of each financial year (end of April 2014 and end of April 2015) on where (in terms of location) and how this additional funding was spent on highways maintenance. This is so local communities are able to see how this extra funding has been spent. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme (HMEP) is a sector-led programme designed to maximise returns from highways investment and deliver efficient and effective services.  HMEP provides practical guidance on highway maintenance efficiencies for local authorities, supplier organisations and representative bodies in the form of toolkits, case studies and good practice.  The most recent of these, launched on 29 November, are the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/hmep/efficiency/standard-spec.php"&gt;standard specification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/hmep/efficiency/asset-management.php"&gt;asset management toolkit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New rights for maritime passengers</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passengers travelling by water are set to enjoy improved rights to assistance in cases of cancelled or delayed departures as a new &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation on maritime passenger rights enters into force today. These passengers will now benefit from similar rights to those travelling by air and rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation, which will apply to most cruise and ferry services operating within the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;, also provides disabled persons or those with reduced mobility the same rights and accessibility assistance when travelling by water, as they have in other transport sectors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipping Minister, Stephen Hammond, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important that passengers receive protection across all modes of transport, enabling them to travel with increased peace of mind throughout the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;. While no one enjoys disruption to their travel plans, I am pleased that this new &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation will provide passengers with the right to assistance in cases of cancelled or delayed departures. I am also pleased that this new regulation provides disabled persons or those with reduced mobility the same rights and accessibility assistance when travelling by water, as they have in other transport sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most journeys run smoothly. On the rare occasions when things do go wrong, it is important that passenger complaints are taken seriously and dealt with effectively at the appropriate level. So in this respect, I am extremely grateful to all the bodies that have agreed to undertake voluntary complaint handling roles. This demonstrates collaborative working between government and industry at its best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of implementation, the Passenger Shipping Association has agreed to act as the voluntary complaint handling body for England and Wales, with London TravelWatch retaining responsibility for services operated and licensed by Transport for London. The Consumer Council for Northern Ireland and the Scottish Government have also agreed to take up similar roles in their respective areas.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Gibbons, Director of the Passenger Shipping Association, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are pleased that the Shipping Minister and the Department for Transport have selected us as the voluntary complaints handling body for Maritime Passenger Rights in England and Wales. Over the past 2 years we have worked very closely with DfT officials together with our member cruise and ferry companies to achieve a successful implementation. We are confident that the industry as a whole will continue to offer customers an excellent service and will deal effectively with any complaints that arise through this new regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to editors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government published its public consultation on UK’s implementation of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation on 5 October 2012. The 6 week consultation closed on 16 November 2012.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation applies in respect of passengers travelling:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on ferry services where the port of embarkation is situated in the territory of an &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member state  &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;on ferry services where the port of embarkation is situated outside the territory of an &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member state and the port of disembarkation is situated in the territory of an &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member state, provided that the service is operated by a union carrier. (‘union carrier’ means a carrier established within the territory of a member state or offering transport by a ferry service operated to or from the territory of a member state.)    &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;on a cruise where the port of embarkation is situated in the territory of an &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member state  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation includes a number of exemptions that are designed to exclude small boats and to protect small businesses. For example, it does not apply to ships certified to carry up to (and including) 12 passengers; on ships which have a crew responsible for the operation of the ship composed of not more than 3 persons; where the distance is less than 500 metres one way and on excursion and sightseeing tours other than cruises.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Under the new &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation, if an individual has a complaint, they should first raise it with the operator. If it cannot be resolved in this way, the complaint may then be referred to the appropriate complaint handling body. It is expected most complaints will be resolved at one of these 2 stages.  However if this is not possible, the complaint may then be investigated by the national enforcement body, who will consider whether there has been a breach of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) will operate as the national enforcement body for the whole of the UK.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>EU Transport Council 18 December 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will attend the last Transport Council of the Cypriot Presidency (the Presidency) taking place in Brussels on Thursday 20 December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council will be asked to reach a general approach on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on periodic road worthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing Directive 2009/40/EC. I was very concerned when we first received the proposal from the Commission. The Commission’s impact assessment was inadequate and failed to make the required links between the costs and benefits of new requirements. It was also incomplete as it did not accurately assess costs in all member states. Our initial analysis was that it would cost over £1 billion pounds to implement while having an insignificant positive impact on road safety in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The position we adopted during the negotiation of the draft periodic roadworthiness regulation at Council working group meetings has been to resist additional burdens where insignificant road safety benefit was identified. With the support of the UK and other member states in resisting excessive burdens, the Presidency has proposed moving from a regulation to a directive and has made substantial changes to the text that radically simplifies the implementation of the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress has been positive and has resulted in a substantially improved and less expensive proposal and as such I hope the Presidency will be able to achieve a general approach on the dossier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Presidency will provide a progress report on 2 other proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the ‘connecting Europe’ facility. The UK abstained from the partial general approach agreed on this dossier at the June Transport Council. While we were broadly supportive of the text of the regulation we could not formally support agreement to the draft regulations in advance of an agreement on the overall Multi-Annual Financial Framework (&lt;abbr title="Multi-Annual Financial Framework"&gt;MFF&lt;/abbr&gt;) negotiations as this could prejudge the overall &lt;abbr title="Multi-Annual Financial Framework"&gt;MFF&lt;/abbr&gt; budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation and exploitation of European satellite navigation systems. The UK supports the thrust of the proposal in introducing a clearer, stable governance arrangement for the programme but has concerns that some of the European Parliament’s proposed amendments, such as the introduction of funding for applications to use the navigation systems, could have significant financial implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council will adopt conclusions on the communication on ‘EU’s external aviation policy – addressing future challenges’. The UK welcomed this timely communication from the Commission and has been actively engaged in the drafting of Council conclusions. We support the broad aims of the communication – liberalisation of aviation and fair competition – and we are pushing to ensure that the Council’s conclusions reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council will also adopt a proposal for a Council decision on the signature, on behalf of the EU, and provisional application of the Euro-Mediterranean aviation agreement between the EU and its member states, on the one part, and the State of Israel, on the other. The UK supports the signature and implementation of this agreement which forms a part of the EU’s external aviation policy to negotiate comprehensive air services agreements with neighbouring countries. This agreement will supersede the current bilateral agreements between individual member states and Israel. It aims at gradual market opening, promoting regulatory (e.g. safety) harmonisation and the promotion of open and fair competition between air carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This agreement will integrate the Israeli aviation market into the European single market accompanied by convergence with EU aviation regulations. It will enhance opportunities for EU airlines and investors in Israel, provide consumer benefits as a result of increased competition and better access, and help to strengthen the economic links between the EU and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under any other business, the Commission will provide information on the cleaner power for transport package and aviation emissions trading scheme (&lt;abbr title="emissions trading scheme"&gt;ETS&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Industry launches new rail technical strategy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail industry leaders have outlined a 30 year vision for the railway through a new edition of the ‘Rail technical strategy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Rail technical strategy’ describes how technology can help the railway increase capacity, improve reliability, cut carbon emissions and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy has been developed by the Technical Strategy Leadership Group – a cross-industry expert body with representatives from across the rail industry – and endorsed by the Rail Delivery Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.futurerailway.org"&gt;Read the Rail technical strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister of State for Transport  Simon Burns MP welcomed the strategy saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the industry picking up the baton to develop this Rail technical strategy. Technology has a vital role to play in improving the railway’s performance, cutting its costs along with carbon emissions and delivering a better travelling experience for passengers. By setting in place a 30 year vision, the railway is demonstrating that it has a bright and exciting future, and the potential to support our economy and society for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Revisions to the levels of funding required by goods and public service vehicle licence holders</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport has given notice of revisions to the levels of funding required by holders of goods and public service vehicle operators’ licences operating for hire or reward. This is a requirement of EU Regulation 1071/2009 which affects holders of standard national and standard international licences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Traffic Commissioners retain their discretion to set the financial standing levels for restricted licence holders (not covered by the regulation) and they propose to maintain the current rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised figures are set out below and are based on the euro exchange rate on the first working day in October 2012 – as prescribed by EU Regulation 1071/2009. The new rates will come into force on 1 January 2013 and will remain in place until the 31 December 2013 (previous rates are in brackets). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Minimum financial level requirement&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Standard national and standard international licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£7,200 (£7,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£4,000, ( £4,200)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Restricted licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£3,100 ( £3,100)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£1,700 ( £1,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial limits set by EU Regulation 1071/2009 are 9000 euros for the first vehicle and 5000 euros for each subsequent vehicle. For member states not participating in monetary union, the regulation requires the equivalent in their currencies to be revised every year, using the euro exchange rate published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the first working day of October in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Transport for everyone </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker is calling on operators and local authorities to work with government to put accessibility and equality front and centre when delivering services for the travelling public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help them to do this, the Department for Transport has published 2 action plans which set out priorities, as well as highlighting areas where action is in the pipeline or already underway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Transport for everyone’ outlines how operators, local councils and the Department can help to make it easier for people using public transport – particularly those with disabilities - to get to where they need to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This action plan builds on the success achieved in improving accessibility on public transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. At the heart of the plan is the importance of improving door-to-door journeys rather than addressing issues in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department’s equality action plan looks at how we can encourage a more inclusive transport network and underlines the importance of ensuring that policy makers at all levels are alive to the particular needs and concerns of different groups in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include affordability issues for young people and pensioners and the ability for all people to travel in safety and free from harassment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A good transport system allows people to access jobs, opportunities and vital services - it needs to work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recognise the concerns that specific groups of people have about public transport and so we have pulled together ideas from across the transport sector on how these concerns can be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The action plans will help policy makers, as well as transport operators, to tackle problems head on and - more importantly - to level the playing field for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liz Sayce OBE, Disability Rights UK Chief Executive, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An accessible transport infrastructure is essential for what Disability Rights UK wants to achieve – disabled people playing a full and equal part in society. Over the past 20 years we have come a long way as our practical guide ‘Doing transport differently’ shows but there are still too many attitudinal, communication and physical barriers facing disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Action plan’ is a step change towards making further progress. We welcome the commitment that the Department for Transport will continue to work in partnership with disabled people and our organisations to ensure the most effective steps are taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Accessibility action plan’ builds on the transport successes of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and aims to create a long lasting legacy of improved access and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Olympic and Paralympic Games, public transport operators carried thousands of spectators with disabilities and work was done to ensure that the travelling public had easy access to information. One of the aims of the ‘Accessibility action plan’ will be to build on the Games Spectator Journey Planner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new planner would cover a wider geographical area and more types of transport as well as being made accessible to people with visual impairments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other measures outlined in the plan include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;considering where £100 million of extra funding might be best spent in the long term to improve accessibility of railway stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;possible further amendments to the Blue Badge scheme to tackle abuse and fraud in this area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building on guidance for mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs to encourage training for those using this equipment &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Equality action plan’ sets out in one place what the department is doing to ensure people from all parts of society have the option to use public transport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points addressed in the plan include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessibility to public transport for young people, older people and those living in rural areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;safety and personal security for women travellers, particularly at night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tackling hate crime and bullying on buses and other public transport &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promoting employment of under-represented groups within the transport industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both documents include lists of issues and the actions that have been, or will be, taken to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;In the interests of transparency and to enable as many people as possible to have their say, the ‘Equality action plan’ will be open for comment until 15 February. These will feed in to a final version of the document which will be published in due course.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorists are being encouraged to find out if their garage is approved by a set of industry-standard codes to make sure they are getting value for money.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call comes after the government accepted a number of proposals made by industry experts to help drive up standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Motorists’ Forum has set out a raft of recommendations aimed at making sure motorists have the best possible consumer experience when having their vehicles serviced or repaired in a report released today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will promote the wider adoption of self-regulation (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;-&lt;abbr title="Trading Standards Institute"&gt;TSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) codes of practice by garages and encourage greater publication of information regarding services they offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an AA survey*, 78% of people always use the same garage meaning that only a minority of motorists shop around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the work carried out by the Motorists’ Forum and believe the recommendations will help build on existing best practice in the industry without the burden of extra legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important that consumers feel confident in the quality and the value for money of the services they are receiving from garages. The Forum’s report has offered some useful proposals for how this can be achieved more consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would urge motorists to find out if their local garage has been approved by the codes to ensure they are getting a fair service and value for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will now use their strong relationships with the industry and stakeholders to promote the adopted recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK car service and repair sector is worth around £6.9 billion per year to the GB economy with 150,000 MOT tests taking place every working day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Motorists’ Forum report on garage customer experience can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-report-of-the-motorists-forum-sub-group-on-improving-customer-service-experience-at-garages"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s response can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-motorists-forum-report-on-garage-customer-experience"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Motorists’ Forum is made up of a group of experts convened by the DfT. Organisations include the AA, RAC, &lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, Centre for Automotive Management, &lt;abbr title="compulsory basic training"&gt;CBT&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Transport for London"&gt;TfL&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Association Of British Insurers"&gt;ABI&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Freight Transport Association"&gt;FTA&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association"&gt;BVRLA&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety"&gt;PACTS&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders"&gt;SMMT&lt;/abbr&gt; as well as representatives from the DfT and Highways Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Trading Standards Institute (&lt;abbr title="Trading Standards Institute"&gt;TSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) will be taking over responsibility for the consumer codes approval scheme from the Office of Fair Trading (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;). The new scheme will maintain the rigour of the current scheme, but will streamline the approval process and make it self-funding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responsibility for vehicle roadworthiness and testing lies with DfT and &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; administers the MOT scheme. Responsibility for consumer protection legislation lies with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is already considerable consumer protection legislation in place to cover the practices of garages which choose to trade unfairly or who are not competent to trade; both from the perspective of individual consumer rights through sale of goods and services legislation, and through the application of criminal sanctions, principally via the Consumer Protection from unfair trading regulations&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Accessibility action plan and equality action plan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today pleased to be publishing the department’s accessibility action plan &lt;a href="/government/publications/accessibility-action-plan"&gt;‘Transport for Everyone: an action plan to improve accessibility for all’&lt;/a&gt;, and, for comment, a draft &lt;a href="/government/publications/equality-action-plan"&gt;equality action plan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has already been achieved in making transport more accessible, and the accessibility action plan seeks to address the challenges that remain. In doing so, we also want to draw on the success of the Olympic and Paralympic Games which demonstrated what can be done to provide those using our public transport system with a positive experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accessibility action plan focuses not only on improving physical accessibility, but also on providing better information for the traveller, and on improving attitudes and behaviour, especially towards disabled passengers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In identifying our priorities in the action plan, we have worked with a large number of representative organisations, individuals, transport operators and local authorities. I am grateful for the support and input that they have provided.  We want transport to be accessible by all and the plan moves us further towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equality action plan presents some of the activities we are undertaking to meet our duties under the equalities legislation, and provides an initial set of priorities for promoting equality and well-being, based on the evidence we have gathered and the engagement we have already had with transport organisations and other interested parties. We are seeking comments on this initial draft and will publish a final version following further engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Consultation on Motoring Services Strategy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today announcing the publication of a &lt;a href="/government/consultations/motoring-services-strategy"&gt;consultation document on the Department for Transport’s Motoring Services Strategy&lt;/a&gt;. In line with the government’s broader vision for public services as set out in the Civil Service Reform Plan, the Open Public Services White Paper and the Government Digital Strategy, the department is outlining broad reform proposals for its four motoring services executive agencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driving Standards Agency (DSA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Strategy sets out three principles for the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;putting consumers and businesses at the heart of what we do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalising the number of bodies and agencies involved in the delivery of our services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working more closely and collaboratively with our partners to deliver services, and boost economic growth by creating opportunities for small and medium size businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this we will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maximise the digital delivery of services to motorists and improve the customer experience. We will also ensure that those who find access to digital services difficult are supported to do so&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reform the Vehicle Certification Agency(VCA) which provides high quality and trusted service to the automotive industry and is recognised for its quality and integrity.  We will look at ways to help VCA to grow and contribute more to the wider economy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explore ways to improve the convenience to customers of the driving test by looking at the locations from which we deliver them &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;transform &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt;, bus and coach testing by expanding joint ventures and collaboration with private sector providers, and reducing the number of government owned test stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalise the number of agencies and reconfigure our organisations to reduce cost and improve consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are inviting views and responses from as broad a range of organisations and users of our services as possible This will include road users, businesses, trade associations, road safety groups, transport associations and others. Improving the way we engage with and listen to them will help to design better services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 7 March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Garage customer experience</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today publishing the &lt;a href="/government/publications/government-response-to-motorists-forum-report-on-garage-customer-experience"&gt;government’s response to the Motorists’ Forum sub-group report recommendations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Motorists’ Forum has set out a raft of recommendations aimed at making sure motorists have the best possible consumer experience when having their vehicles serviced or repaired in the report released today. The Department for Transport (DfT) and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) have worked closely together to produce the government response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car service and repair sector is worth around £6.9 billion per year to the GB economy with 150,000 MOT tests taking place every working day.  The garage industry is important both to transport policy (especially road safety) and as part of a wider landscape of consumer affairs.  It is important that consumers feel confident in the quality and the value for money of the services they are receiving from garages.  The Motorists’ Forum’s report has offered some useful proposals for how this can be achieved more consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome the work carried out by the Motorists’ Forum and believe the recommendations we plan to adopt will help build on existing best practice in the industry and encourage garages to improve customer services, without the burden of extra legislation.  The recommendations we will be adopting will promote the wider adoption of self-regulation (OFT-TSI) codes of practice by garages and encourage greater publication of information regarding the services they offer.  As of November this year we have already introduced the requirement to have vehicle mileages printed on MOT certificates to help combat ‘clocking’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DfT and BIS will now use their strong relationships with the garage industry and stakeholders to promote the adopted recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Motorists’ Forum sub-group report and the government’s response can be &lt;a href="/government/publications/government-response-to-motorists-forum-report-on-garage-customer-experience"&gt;found on the Gov.uk website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>£19.5 million to kick start regeneration in Portsmouth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work to kick-start the regeneration of the 22 hectare Tipner site in Portsmouth can now start after receiving final approval from Local Transport Minister Norman Baker today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme will see Portsmouth City Council deliver extensive improvements including a new access road to the site from the M275 and a new Park &amp;amp; Ride scheme. As well as improving access to the regeneration site at Tipner, the scheme will relieve traffic and congestion on local residential roads around the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This important scheme will encourage regeneration of the Tipner site by opening up access to the area for businesses and visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The new junction on the M275 and the new park and ride scheme will be a huge boost for the area - helping to deliver new homes and new jobs as well as reducing congestion and encouraging visitors to the city. Having visited Portsmouth to see for myself, I am in no doubt that this is a good scheme and a sensible use of taxpayers money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The £19.5 million we are putting into this scheme shows that the coalition government is serious about investing in the infrastructure the country needs to drive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme will deliver:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new motorway junction on the M275 at Tipner providing access to the development site and greatly reduce the impact of construction traffic on local roads - at present the only access to the site is via existing narrow Victorian streets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new additional bus priority lane on the M275 heading south from the new interchange - this is intended to improve public transport between Tipner and central Portsmouth and improve bus reliability, this will be an additional lane and would not remove any capacity for general traffic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a park and ride site accessed via the new motorway junction, with bus every 10 minutes to the city centre/Gunwharf Quays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tipner scheme was one of the schemes given funding approval last year as part of the spending review process. Work can now start on the construction with the project scheduled to complete in April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement grants full (final) approval to the Tipner scheme enabling work to begin.The department will provide a maximum of £19.5 million towards the full scheme cost of £28.19 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Office of Rail Regulation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank-you ladies and gentlemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great pleasure to join you today for this important conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re here to talk about ‘transparency’ – one of those modern buzzwords that we hear all the time in politics, business, and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by giving you my own perspective on transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transparency-for-the-customer"&gt;Transparency for the customer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I speak as a rail minister…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a regular user of the rail network…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a Liberal Democrat…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have campaigned for transparency ever since I was first elected in 1997.  The first bill I presented to Parliament was on the release of public records and I was the first person to submit a &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; request of MPs’ expenses, with all the ramifications that led to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you won’t be surprised that I’m a passionate believer in transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s something we need to see more of from every powerful institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud of the progress we have made to open up government and the wider public sector in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I will say this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about building the respect, trust and confidence of the people who use and fund the network - passengers, freight customers, and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true measure of transparency comes not from those who claim to practise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes from those on the outside who stand to benefit from it… the passengers and the public who provide the patronage and pounds sterling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be a shared agenda, while we have made big strides over the past few years, we still have some way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/government/publications/report-of-the-laidlaw-inquiry"&gt;Laidlaw report&lt;/a&gt; last week made a specific criticism of the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; when it said the department wasn’t transparent enough with bidders about the franchise process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are correcting that and we will be more transparent in future, but you have to do your bit as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rail-transparency"&gt;Rail transparency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me put rail transparency in some sort of perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;Open Public Services White Paper&lt;/a&gt; last year set the scene for the government’s transparency agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was followed this year by another White Paper and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/dft-open-data-strategy"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Open Data Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamental to these programmes are public services which are responsive to the people they serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations which can be held to account by citizens and elected representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open data is crucial to this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our rail reform programme highlighted 3 specific areas for transparency: rail finances; network performance and open access to information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so much has already been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together we are now publishing a great deal of performance data, from right time and passenger complaints to statistics on overcrowding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; has set out the costs of supporting the network by &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt;; subsidies per mile; and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network Rail has separated accounts by route. And new information about &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt; finances will be published next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And passengers have much better access to timetables and real time service information than they had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, data produced by Network Rail is allowing developers to generate phone and computer apps for passengers on how trains are running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a private-sector, not-for-dividend, company limited by guarantee, Network Rail is not currently subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Nonetheless, as a regulated provider of public services, in receipt of public subsidy, the company wisely recognises the demand for more of its information and data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, it began a programme to publish more of its information and data on its website, including an on-line form allowing members of the public to make suggestions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government welcomes these steps, which will improve the organisation’s accountability to passengers and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I welcome the excellent news from the last &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dft-transport-sector-transparency-board"&gt;Transport Transparency Board&lt;/a&gt; that the fares database will be released as open data during the first quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="olympics"&gt;Olympics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these transparency measures are designed for long-term dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Olympic Games earlier this year set the industry a more immediate challenge around the provision of transport data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key part of the programme was to provide businesses and the public with information about the transport network, and which stations were likely to be busiest at different times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Transport for London"&gt;TfL&lt;/abbr&gt;, Network Rail, &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt; and train operators worked with organisers to produce ‘hotspot’ data which was published on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.getaheadofthegames.com/"&gt;Get Ahead of the Games&lt;/a&gt; website – together with journey planners and interactive tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site had over 16 million page views and 4 million unique users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it played a key role in what was an enormously successful operation to manage transport demand during the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experience was invaluable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It showed just what can be achieved by planning ahead and communicating information to users of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was also a lesson in how to deliver data effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is of little use if it’s too complicated or inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has to be carefully managed, targeted and presented to meet the needs and expectations of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s precisely what was achieved by the team who delivered the Olympics transport plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fares-and-ticketing"&gt;Fares and ticketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the government re-shuffle back in September, the new &lt;a href="/government/people/patrick-mcloughlin"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; asked me to lead the &lt;a href="/government/consultations/rail-fares-and-ticketing-review"&gt;fares and ticketing review&lt;/a&gt; in the department.  You will appreciate that this is a hugely labyrinthine process.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I am concerned, transparency is key to the review.  I want an outcome where the passenger can easily access the right information to enable them to buy the right ticket for their journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while many do, many don’t.  Indeed, there appears to be some confusion even at the highest levels, judging by &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;’s comments in the metro last week blaming the government for the rise in unregulated fares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now turn to the issue of right-time information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="right-time"&gt;Right-time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will know, I have been pushing for the release of right-time – the number of trains arriving within 59 seconds of the advertised arrival time - for some time now, actually for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first raised this formally at the Performance Delivery Group which I chair on 20 July 2011 and I am to be honest disappointed that it has taken this long to get where we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear that it is not the intention of the government to replace &lt;abbr title="Public Performance Measure"&gt;PPM&lt;/abbr&gt; with right-time for performance benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may together conclude that the correct benchmark is whether a long-distance service arrives within 9 minutes and 59 seconds, but it is close to dishonest to suggest that a train arriving 9 minutes and 59 seconds after its stated arrival time is on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public are entitled to know the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I recognise, and indeed sympathise, that there is a concern within the industry that if this information is published, you will be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I observe at this point that ScotRail recently released its right-time data and the world has not ended north of the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that releasing information to the public can be uncomfortable – just look at the hundreds of &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; requests we have to deal with in the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; each month.  But actually the free availability of information is a key tool to driving up performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry will be releasing right-time data by &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt; on 20 December, even if the timing means it won’t be getting much coverage, I will be making a lot of noise about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be making comments saying what a good showing this is from the industry.  In terms of both performance and transparency we’re ahead of our European competitors so this staging post is welcome, but we need to go further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commuter on the 6:40 from Aylesbury, the student on the 8:32 to Brighton and the occasional traveller on the 10:15 to Nuneaton have a right to know whether their train is regularly on time or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look fwd to these passengers having the data they need when we make a further right-time release in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This information is held by the ORR and, as such, it is available under the &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; laws.  It is in my view far better for the industry to be on the front-foot with this rather than have it extracted by someone hostile to the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-transport-sectors"&gt;Other transport sectors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony is that the rail industry is doing pretty well in punctuality.  Both in comparisons with other countries, and in this country when compared with other modes.  Why hide your light under a bushel as if there is a guilty secret?  Those of you who have been to my office will have heard me reference the poster in my office which champions the railway against the clogged road network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am determined the same level of transparency should apply to other transport sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Highways Agency, for example, has released a wide range of statistics about roadworks and real-time traffic conditions, and over 80% local authorities have opened up their roadwork data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working with the Agency to improve reliability data for the motorway network, and hope to publish information on the wider road network next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus industry has released its national database of services across Britain, with access to real time information from all 350,000 bus stops… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple but enormously effective improvement for passengers, particularly during these winter months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the aviation industry is also embracing transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is already publishing monthly punctuality data by route and airline for 10 UK airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our Civil Aviation Bill will enshrine further powers to collect and publish data to help the consumer. Specifically, it will require the industry to provide information that the CAA considers appropriate to help passengers understand and compare different services and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Bill has completed its passage through Parliament and now awaits Royal Assent.  We anticipate that this will be before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s more the aviation industry could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, we would like the airlines to provide clearer information about the ticket price their customers should expect to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in reality, you have a good story to tell.  Some of you, however, are mindlessly trying to cover it up.  This is 1950s thinking and frankly, it won’t wash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me conclude by first of all recognising and congratulating the industry for the strides it has made towards greater transparency in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an industry that received £3 billion of public subsidy in 2010/11, the public has a right to clearer and more open information on costs, performance and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is what you are delivering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also urge you – wherever possible – to press ahead with further transparency in the future so it becomes embedded in the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I believe that whatever helps the passenger will ultimately help the railway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Road safety</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to update the House on the launch of the government’s latest Think! Road Safety campaign, targeted at drink driving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action by successive governments over the last 30 years has meant that the number of people killed in drink drive accidents has been reduced by over three-quarters since 1979.  But drink driving remains a problem, 280 people lost their lives in 2011 in drink drive accidents on Britain’s roads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in partnership with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.acpo.police.uk/"&gt;Association of Chief Police Officers (&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, so that people see education and enforcement working together, the government has just relaunched its successful Think! campaign aimed at reminding drivers – particularly young drivers, who are over-represented in the casualty figures – of the risks of getting behind the wheel after consuming alcohol: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://think.direct.gov.uk/"&gt;http://think.direct.gov.uk/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt; enforcement anti-drink and drug driving enforcement campaign seeks particularly to focus on well-intentioned drivers who do not think they are breaking the law but may be over the legal limit by the time they get into their cars in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, at the end of last week I launched a further round of the very successful &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/campaign-to-reward-designated-drivers-launched-by-coca-cola-great-britain-and-think"&gt;designated driver campaign, in partnership with Coca-Cola&lt;/a&gt;. Now in its 5th year, the nationwide campaign offers designated drivers a ‘buy one get one free’ deal on Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero at participating pubs.  The campaign began last Thursday and will run until the end of December. Further details are available at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/designated-driver/"&gt;http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/designated-driver/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Autumn statement: huge boost for transport</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor announced funding for the following transport projects as part of the Autumn statement 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="scheme-a1-leeming-to-barton-improvements"&gt;Scheme: A1 Leeming to Barton improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £314 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upgrading the A1 between Leeming to Barton to motorway standard by upgrading a dual carriageway to a three lane road&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will create a continuous motorway standard route from Leeds to Newcastle and London to Newcastle (via M1/A1M)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it will also improve journey times between Leeming and Barton and over 60 years is predicted to save around 100 lives and prevent around 650 serious casualties as well as helping speed up the time it takes to clear up traffic incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;during construction it is estimated that at its peak up to 750 new jobs will be created in the construction industry over the three year construction period&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;completion of the scheme will support the economic competitiveness of the north-east and improve access to regional employment areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the reduction in journey times of some 20% will directly benefit business users, improving the attractiveness of these areas for future development and growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;works are planned to start in 2013/14 with the scheme open for traffic by 2016/17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-a5-m1-link-dunstable-northern-bypass"&gt;Scheme: A5-M1 link (Dunstable northern bypass)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £126.6 million (Department for Transport (DfT) contribution)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new dual two-lane road between the A5 (western end) and the M1 (eastern end) north of Dunstable and Houghton Regis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will remove through traffic between Dunstable and the M1 speeding up longer distance north south trips&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme will also unlock the development of 7,000 houses and 40 hectares of employment land – potentially providing 4,000 jobs – at Houghton Regis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work will start in 2014/15 with the scheme open for traffic in 2015/16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-a1-lobley-hill-improvement"&gt;Scheme: A1 Lobley Hill improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £64 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new roads in both directions parallel to the existing A1 between Lobley Hill and A184 in Gateshead&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme will provide an alternative route for local traffic improving congestion and accident rates on one of the most congested sections of the network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the government made a commitment through the Newcastle ‘City Deal’ process to work with local partners on considering proposals to address congestion on the A1 Newcastle/Gateshead western bypass – including proposals to deliver the Lobley Hill improvements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it also helps support local regeneration and development, including the creation of up to 22,000 new jobs, as the congestion is considered as a major constraint to expansion of regional employment and housing &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work is planned to start in 2014/15 with the scheme open for traffic by 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-highways-maintenance"&gt;Scheme: Highways maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £333 million &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dedicated fund for essential maintenance to renew, repair and extend life of road network in England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it will be used for improvements such as road resurfacing, maintenance to bridges, or repair damage caused by weather events, like recent floods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the money will be split between Highways Agency and local authorities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;details of how each area will benefit from this additional investment will be announced shortly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-strategic-road-pinch-point-fund"&gt;Scheme: Strategic road pinch point fund&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £100 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;additional funding for the Highways Agency’s pinch point fund to improve congestion and safety at bottlenecks on the strategic road network and facilitate local economic growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it will be used for improvements such as road widening and junction improvements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;schemes delivered as part of this programme will facilitate the creation of jobs and housing, improve access to enterprise zones and transport gateways that are within the vicinity of the scheme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Highways Agency will now work on identifying the specific projects that will benefit and make an announcement shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-local-pinch-point-fund"&gt;Scheme: Local pinch point fund&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £170 million &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fund to remove bottlenecks and support development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;schemes delivered as part of this programme will facilitate the creation of jobs and housing development, improve access to enterprise zones and transport gateways - this could include new access roads, junction improvements or bridge strengthening&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the fund is open to local transport authorities in England - guidance on how to apply for funding and timescales will be published shortly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;schemes considered will be ones that can be delivered quickly delivering an immediate impact on growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-a30-temple-to-carblake"&gt;Scheme: A30 Temple to Carblake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £60 million (£30 million DfT contribution and £30 million Cornwall Council contribution)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a 2.6 mile dualling of the existing single carriageway section of the A30 between Temple and Higher Carblake including changes to existing junctions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme will relieve congestion and improve journey times - it will also attract business growth and inward investment to Cornwall by improving links the rest of England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cornwall Council is proposing to deliver and part-fund the scheme on behalf of the Secretary of State&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work will start in 2014/2015 (subject to the completion of planning processes and funding agreements between Cornwall Council) with the scheme open for traffic in 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-accelerated-national-road-projects"&gt;Scheme: Accelerated national road projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £95 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the acceleration of three major motorway upgrades for M3 J2 to 4a, Surrey, M6 J10a to 13, West Midlands and M1 J28 to 31, Derbyshire to deliver the improvement schemes by spring 2015&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will result in increased capacity of 73 miles and reduced congestion through use of the hard shoulder as an extra lane&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vital improvements to the A160/A180 route to the port of Immingham will also be brought forward to start construction in the summer of 2015 (subject to the completion of statutory processes), with completion in autumn 2016 - cutting 18 months off the original construction timetable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-development-of-future-national-road-projects"&gt;Scheme: Development of future national road projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £42 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuing the development (detailed design, modelling and preparatory work) of future major road projects to maintain a pipeline of major road infrastructure proposals for delivery in the next spending review&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the development work will put in place the necessary preparatory work and analysis to ensure the Department for Transport can plan its future investments and ensure it is in a position to deliver vital future infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the development funding provides a contribution to UK job creation as it will be delivered in part through the transport supply chain &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the department has previously identified a number of future national road proposals and will announce in due course which schemes will have their development work funded, following a process of prioritisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-cycling-infrastructure-improvements"&gt;Scheme: Cycling infrastructure improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £42 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this funding will support infrastructure improvements that make it easier and safer for people get around their local areas by bicycle  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this could include more cycle lanes or tracks, improvements to junctions and signals, and cycle parking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;local authorities will design solutions best for their areas while keeping a strong focus on economic growth and carbon reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-m25-junction-30-improvements"&gt;Scheme: M25 junction 30 improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £150 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved interface between M25 junction 30 and the A13 making the Thames Gateway more attractive to prospective developers, and improving access to the Lakeside shopping centre and the Port of Tilbury &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Highways Agency will now work up detailed plans for the scheme but options being considered are widening of the A13 and increased capacity at the junction roundabout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will need to take account of the location of an additional crossing over the Lower Thames&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following scheme was also announced but will be funded from existing Highways Agency budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="scheme-m40-j12-improvement"&gt;Scheme: M40 J12 improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £10 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving the layout at J12 of the M40 near Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) facility which includes their Research and Development Centre and the Aston Martin Lagonda site &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme includes realignment of the slip roads and a local side road and the installation of traffic signals at the top of the slip roads -it will assist traffic using the M40 which includes over 6,000 vehicles travelling to and from the JLR site and improve safety at the junction by alleviating traffic queuing back onto the M40 at peak times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme supports local economic growth and will benefit the national economy by reducing localised congestion on this strategic route between the Midlands and the south-east - it will also improve safety &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme is being funded from existing Highways Agency budgets &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>West Coast Main Line: Final report of the Laidlaw inquiry</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The independent inquiry into the cancelled West Coast Main Line franchise competition has concluded that the project failed because of an accumulation of significant errors related to inadequate planning and preparation, complex organisational structure, and a weak governance framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin asked Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica and a non-executive &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; board member, to conduct an urgent investigation following the discovery of unacceptable flaws in the procurement process that led to the competition being cancelled on October 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-laidlaw-inquiry"&gt;final report&lt;/a&gt;, published today by the Department for Transport, finds that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; used flawed and inconsistent methodology when guiding bidders on the amount of risk capital (known as the Subordinated Loan Facility) they would need to offer to guarantee their franchise against default (Inquiry report paragraph 4.31, p22)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Subordinated Loan Facility figures resulting from the flawed methodology were then varied in a way that contravened franchise competition rules (3.4, p11)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ministers made the original August 14 provisional contract award without being told about the critical flaws (2.12, p8) and having been given “inaccurate reports” (3.8, p12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Laidlaw Inquiry also concluded that: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the report’s recommendations to strengthen accountability and governance structures “if acted upon quickly and effectively, will help to restore confidence in the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;’s ability to conduct effective rail franchising and procurement” (paragraph 8.6, p79)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;while there were inconsistencies in the way First Group and Virgin Trains Ltd were treated during the franchise process, the report finds that there is no evidence of a culture of bias against Virgin at the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; (paragraph 2.6, p7)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is nothing in the report to suggest that the flaws discovered in this franchise competition exist in any other &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; procurements (paragraph 8.3, p79)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; is today publishing its formal response to the report which commits the department to implementing swiftly a series of actions that will enable it to resume the franchising programme, with the confidence of the rail industry, as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring future franchise competitions are delivered at a good pace based on sound planning, a clear timeline, rigorous management, and the right quality assurance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creating a simpler and clearer structure and governance process for rail franchise competitions, including the appointment of a single director general with responsibility for all rail policy and franchising&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensuring we have the right mix of professional skills, in-house, and where necessary from professional external advisers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Laidlaw said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Building upon and confirming the conclusions from my initial findings, the final report provides an in-depth analysis of the events that led to the flaws whereby the InterCity West Coast competition was cancelled. Alongside this I have also made a series of recommendations for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have explained in detail the technical nature of certain errors, specifically around modelling flaws and the Subordinated Loan Facility sizing process. In addition, the report outlines an accumulation of contributory causes including a lack of transparency, inadequate planning and preparation, as well as a complex and confusing organisational structure with weak quality assurance and insufficient governance oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While it is clear that a number of serious and regrettable errors have occurred, I believe that if acted upon quickly and effectively, my recommendations will help to restore confidence in the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;’s ability to conduct effective rail franchising and procurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick McLoughlin said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The final report from the Laidlaw inquiry makes extremely uncomfortable reading for the department. It has identified precisely what went wrong, revealing serious failures, as well as offering us a number of sensible recommendations to put things right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will not allow these mistakes to be made again and the department is determined to ensure all future franchise competitions are conducted on the basis of sound planning, the rigorous identification and oversight of risk, and the right quality assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sam Laidlaw has delivered an uncompromising report that offers us a way to face up to a number of shortcomings and I would like to thank him and his team for producing these findings with such diligence and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; Permanent Secretary Philip Rutnam said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no question that this has been a serious blow for the department and I am determined that we learn everything we can from this episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will implement all of Mr Laidlaw’s recommendations, and go further, to ensure we have the right set of skills, support and training to ensure failures like this do not happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Permanent Secretary concerning West Coast Main Line</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Department for Transport Permanent Secretary Philip Rutnam yesterday received the report of the investigation into the role and conduct of officials in the award process for the ICWC franchise process conducted by Bill Stow (a former Director General at Defra). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is now considering the report and decisions on action following this investigation will be made shortly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Permanent Secretary decided yesterday to lift the suspensions of three DfT officials imposed on the 3 October. The decision to suspend a member of staff, or to lift that suspension, is separate from the disciplinary process and does not imply any conclusion on culpability.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Trains to run improved west coast services</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail passengers will experience better services including 28,000 more seats a day under an agreement announced today for Virgin Trains to continue operating rail services on the West Coast Main Line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new franchise agreement will run for up to 23 months after which the West Coast Main Line will be let under a long-term franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It coincides with the early completion of a government-backed deal to roll out 106 new Pendolino carriages, providing passengers with four new 11-carriage trains and lengthening 31 existing trains from nine carriages to 11. A new hourly service between London and Glasgow will also be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick McLoughlin said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are determined to ensure not only that passengers continue to experience the same levels of service they have in the past, but that services improve. There will be a new hourly service linking Glasgow and London and we will also work with Virgin Trains to explore other service improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am also extremely pleased that passengers will benefit from up to 28,000 more seats daily thanks to the delivery of 106 new Pendolino carriages onto the West Coast Main Line which has happened on budget and ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passengers travelling on Virgin Trains will also find it easier to claim compensation if their train is severely delayed thanks to plans for Virgin Trains to introduce an improved passenger’s charter incorporating a delay repay scheme from 1 April 2013, subject to agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-for-editors"&gt;Notes for editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 23 month franchise will run from 9 December 2012 until 9 November 2014 after which the West Coast Main Line will be let under a long-term franchise. The Department for Transport (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;) will be able to shorten this period by up to six months if a subsequent franchise can be let on a shorter timescale.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The franchise will operate as a management contract with both revenue and cost risk being borne by the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;. In return Virgin Rail Group (&lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt;) will receive a margin of 1% on revenue for operating services. The franchise also makes a provision for the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt; to agree revised commercial terms that would see &lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt; take greater revenue and cost risk in the period to 9 November 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 106 Pendolino carriages project has been delivered on budget and ahead of schedule and has resulted from a successful collaboration between the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;, Virgin Trains, Alstom, Angel Trains and Network Rail.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Campaign to reward designated drivers launched by Coca-Cola Great Britain and THINK!</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designated drivers will be rewarded with a ‘buy one get one free’ deal on Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero, this Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the winter period designated drivers across the UK will give lifts to friends and family as they enjoy a festive night out at pubs and bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Great Britain and the Road Safety Minister, Stephen Hammond MP, will today celebrate and pledge to reward responsible drivers, at the launch of this year’s designated driver campaign at the Mason Arms pub in Central London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in its 5th year the nationwide designated driver campaign will reward drivers who choose not to drink alcohol with a ‘buy one, get one free’ offer on Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and CokeZero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme will run for 3 weeks from 6 to 31 December and is part of an ongoing partnership with the THINK! driver friendly campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dedicated website has also been set up to encourage consumers to take advantage of the offer. From the 6 December designated drivers and their friends can visit &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/designated-driver/"&gt;the Coca-Cola website&lt;/a&gt; to find a participating pub in their area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hammond, Road Safety Minister, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our THINK! campaign makes it clear that drink drivers risk losing their licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am pleased that THINK! will be teaming up with Coca-Cola and pub chains across the country to reward designated drivers as well as reminding people of the consequences of getting a drink drive conviction. No one wants to spend their Christmas in a police cell.  My message is clear: don’t drink and drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon Woods, General Manager, Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Designated drivers provide an amazing service to friends and family. They allow people to have a good night and also help keep roads safe, so everyone can enjoy the Christmas period. By rewarding drivers who choose not to drink with a free Coke, Diet Coke or Coke Zero, we hope even more people will be encouraged to do the right thing and become responsible drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kieron Murphy, Licensee, Masons Arms: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We see a lot of people come in over the Christmas period who are responsible for driving their friends and family home at the end of the night. That’s why we are delighted to be participating in Coca-Cola’s designated driver campaign this year.  It will reward our regulars and make sure they still have a good night out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch event will take place on 6 December (7.30-9am) at the Mason Arms, Maddox Street, London. The designated driver campaign forms part of Coca-Cola Great Britain’s pledge to promote the positive role in which soft drinks can play as credible alternatives to alcohol. The designated driver campaign is a key feature of Coca-Cola Great Britain’s overall commitment to responsible marketing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="about-the-research"&gt;About the research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research was conducted by Populus for Coca-Cola in November 2011 with 2000 adults. Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;79% of women have used a designated driver at the end of a night out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;men are more likely to abstain from alcohol with 63% having given it up to drive friends/family home before &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;62% of adults plan to go to a pub or bar over the Christmas and New Year period&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two thirds of those aged 65+ have been a designated driver compared to just over half of 18 to 24 year olds &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;however 18 to 24 year olds will give the most lifts over the Christmas and New Year period, on average taking 5 people &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the majority of those polled never drive home after drinking more than one alcoholic drink on a night out (83%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nearly half of respondents thought that the best thing about designated drivers is that they stop people drink driving, while 3 in 4 believe it is because they ensure people can get home safely at the end of a night out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="about-coca-cola-great-britain"&gt;About Coca-Cola Great Britain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Great Britain is responsible for marketing 21 brands and over 100 products to consumers across Great Britain, focusing upon developing new brands, extending existing brands and protecting trademarks including Coca-Cola (recognised as the world’s most valuable brand). Other Coca-Cola Great Britain brands include Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Fanta, Sprite, Dr Pepper, Oasis, Glaceauvitaminwater, Schweppes, 5 Alive, Lilt, Kia Ora, Relentless Energy Drink and Powerade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola Great Britain portfolio is worth £1,998 million with value sales growth of 8.4% year on year.  Within this the My Coke trilogy (Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coke Zero) is worth £1,150 million, growing at 6.4% in value year on year (Neilsen, w/c 11/02/12).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Great Britain is committed to developing innovative, responsible and sustainable initiatives that help protect the environment.  Recently the company launched its PlantBottle™ plastic made from up to 22.5% plant-based materials and up to 25% recycled plastic as the latest step on its journey towards petroleum-free plastic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="about-the-think-drink-drive-campaign-and-driver-friendly-initiative"&gt;About the THINK! drink drive campaign and driver friendly initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of people killed in drink drive accidents has been reduced by over three-quarters since 1979 thanks to more than 30 years of government education campaigns and measures to improve enforcement. However, drink driving is still a problem and provisional statistics show that 280 people lost their lives in drink drive accidents on Britain’s road in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The THINK! campaign has had a long-standing and well supported partnership with the on-trade and soft drinks industry. In December 2009, this was developed into the ‘driver friendly’ campaign which aims to support the designated driver through the provision of promotional offers and ‘rewards’, linked to the purchase of soft drinks, on their night out. Coca-Cola GB is leading the way for Christmas 2012, and their designated driver promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
