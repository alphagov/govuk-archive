    <title>THINK! Don’t drink drive this Christmas</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;THINK! and the Association of Chief Police Officers (&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;) are joining forces to warn drivers that getting behind the wheel after a festive tipple could see them end up behind bars this Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hard-hitting television advert highlighting the consequences of drink driving will be shown throughout December as part of the Department for Transport’s THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt; today also launched its anti-drink and drug driving enforcement campaign, warning that young drivers and people driving the morning after a night of drinking pose a huge risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Drivers should be in no doubt that if they get behind the wheel after drinking this Christmas, they risk losing their licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Christmas should be a time for a celebration not a night in the cells. That is why our TV advert reminds drivers of the consequences of a drink drive conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2011, 280 people were killed in accidents where the driver was over the limit. Our message is clear: Do not let a selfish decision ruin your life or someone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt; roads policing lead, Deputy Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you don’t drink and drive this Christmas you reduce the risk of killing an innocent person, or yourself. It is really that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is an absolute scourge on our society and shameful that in 2012 some drivers fail to realise the impact of drink or drug driving. Next year’s figures could include them or one of their family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, drivers aged between 20 and 24 failed more breath tests than any other age group. This year’s THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign is aimed at young people who are shown to be consistently over-represented in drink drive casualty figures.* &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s enforcement campaign targets well-intentioned drivers who do not think they are breaking the law but may be over the legal limit by the time they get into their cars in the morning. Police forces will be taking to roads across the country to stop and check drivers. Those found to be over the limit will face prosecution, which can lead to a jail sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCC Davenport added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are some drivers who think they are obeying the law but are in fact breaking it by getting into their cars the morning after a night of drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People may be surprised to hear that last year between the hours of 6am and 11am more than 400 people failed breath tests (or refused to provide a specimen), which is more than those caught for the hour before or after midnight. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Drivers need to be aware that regardless of the time of day they are caught, whether they are going to work or taking children to school, they will face the same penalties as someone who has chosen to drink heavily in a pub and driven at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Gifford, Executive Director of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS), said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is good to see the department re-launching the Christmas drink-drive campaign. This advert reminds drivers that the choice is theirs but the responsibility for the wrong choice will stay with them for years to come. If in doubt, do not try to mix two activities. Stay sober at Christmas and during the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the THINK! campaign, the Department for Transport is currently consulting on a package of tough measures to crack down on drink drivers. This includes removing drink drivers’ rights to demand a blood or urine test. This is because evidence shows it is used as a delaying tactic by drivers caught over the limit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is provisionally estimated that 2011 saw 280 deaths, 1290 serious injuries and 9,990 total casualties directly related to drink driving incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The THINK! Christmas Drink Drive campaign budget totals £783,925 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The THINK! TV advert - Moment of Doubt - will be aired 4 December to 23 December. For a high-resolution copy of the advert contact the Department for Transport’s press office on 020 7944 6898&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;THINK! campaign posters can be downloaded directly from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://think.direct.gov.uk/drink-driving.html"&gt;campaign site&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Christmas campaign runs from 1 December 2012 to 1 January 2013 &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Institute of Advanced Motorists </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank-you for that introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank-you also for asking me along - it’s an absolute pleasure to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="not-complacent"&gt;Not complacent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I took up my post I inherited a road safety record second to none. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This country is a genuine world leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean for a single minute that it’s ‘job done’ or ‘mission accomplished’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, the provisional figures for the year ending June 2012 show a reduction in fatalities compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, it is very welcome news that, for all road users, the numbers killed and seriously injured are down 17% compared with the 2005-2009 average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s also worth remembering that, while the 2011 figures were slightly up on 2010, the 2010 figures were exceptionally low, and that 2011 was still lower than 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in spite of all we have achieved, we should never forget that road deaths are not statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are someone’s mother or father, brother or sister, son or daughter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are real lives cut short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as Simon (Simon Best – &lt;abbr title="Institute of Advanced Motorists"&gt;IAM&lt;/abbr&gt;) reminded us, road accidents also hit the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers and the graphs may change from year to year, but one thing stays constant - accidents carry a heavy human cost and a huge economic price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why this government is not complacent on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we will continue to do all we can to make our roads safer in our ambition to be the safest we can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in the short time I have today I don’t want to talk you through every last dot and comma of the government’s road safety agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I would like to do is give you an insight into my thinking around some of the key priority areas as I see them - a brief but broad overview if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="localism"&gt;Localism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let me touch on an issue Simon mentioned in his speech - the important road safety role of local authorities, especially in terms of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are testing economic times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I recognise that local government, just like central government, faces tough spending choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also know that it is local communities, rather than Whitehall bureaucrats, who are best placed to design local road safety solutions to meet local road safety challenges&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that includes deciding where to focus their resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what localism is all about - the power to choose for yourself, backed by the funding to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are giving more than £1 billion to local councils enabling them to improve the transport infrastructure – including the design of better and safer roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re investing £600 million in local transport through the Local Sustainable Transport Fund – which again gives authorities greater power to deliver their own transport projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Transport for Manchester secured £32.5 million from the Fund for their ‘Let’s get to work project’ - a project designed to give people the kind of viable travel options that allow them to make their journey to work in way that is healthier and safer, cleaner and greener, whether it’s walking, cycling or hopping on the local bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the &lt;abbr title="Local Sustainable Transport Fund"&gt;LSTF&lt;/abbr&gt; projects contain a cycling element – not just providing better routes, but also making roads safer for cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take the issue of cycle safety very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial at a time when thousands of people are taking up bike riding - inspired by the heroics of our Tour de France, Olympic and Paralympic cyclists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the department has recently launched a THINK! cycle safety campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve made £30 million available to tackle dangerous junctions for cyclists across the country&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have made it simpler for councils to put in place 20mph zones - and install Trixi mirrors to improve the visibility of cyclists at junctions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycle safety is about embracing technology and changing behaviour. So we will continue to develop new ideas and initiatives to build on the progress we’ve already made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="drug-driving"&gt;Drug driving&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d argue that one of the great successes of road safety over the last 40 years has been the extent to which drink driving has become socially unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the number of drink drive deaths has fallen by more than 75% since 1979. The culture has completely changed from social necessity to social pariah, such is the view of today’s drink drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sadly, people are still losing their lives because of drink drive collisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;280 were killed last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, through our award winning THINK Campaign, we continue to push home the message that people who drive while over the limit risk losing their licence, being fined or even going to prison. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, they have to be aware that they could injure, or worse kill someone – including someone they love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve also just launched a drink-drive consultation which includes proposals to close down the legal loopholes where some drivers try to avoid prosecution by demanding to replace their breath test with blood or urine tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink driving kills. Fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in my view, it is just as socially unacceptable and dangerous to drive while impaired by drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we tackled drink driving in the 1980s, now in the 2010s, it’s time to defeat drug driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I believe we have to make sure that drug drivers face the full force of the law, just like drink drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the government is taking three major steps to do just that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;type approval will shortly be given to drug testing devices for police stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we expect to introduce road-side drug screeners during 2014&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and the new law to prosecute drug-drivers will also come into come into effect by the summer of 2014 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This government is on the side of the motoring majority who abide by the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to the reckless minority of drivers who think they can take drugs, jump behind the wheel and get away with it, my message is clear and it’s simple - you will be caught and you will be punished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-hard-core-few-and-the-law-abiding-many"&gt;The hard core few and the law abiding many&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now say a few words about the hard core few and the law abiding many. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re targeting enforcement efforts against the dangerous behaviour of the hardcore few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drivers who commit serious, deliberate and repeated offences - the ones with a poor attitude rather than poor skills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told you about cracking down on drink drivers. But there’s no hiding place for the uninsured either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, for example, we’re making full use of existing powers to seize an offender’s vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police seized around 140,000 vehicles for this offence last year, and the level of uninsured driving has decreased from around 2 million drivers in 2005 to 1.2 million drivers in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also introduced the continuous insurance enforcement scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insurance industry estimate that, with the introduction of this scheme - assuming that police enforcement continues at its current rate - the level of uninsured driving could be reduced by up to 40% in the next 5 years&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the law abiding many that’s good news, both for road safety and, I hope, for future insurance premiums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I believe it’s absolutely vital to support the law abiding many.
The motorists who want to do the right thing and who just need a nudge in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, that means offering more educational options to drivers who make genuine mistakes, display poor skills or commit occasional low level offences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means improving training and testing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the reason we’ve made changes to the practical portion of the driving test so that, instead of being taught how to pass a test, people will actually learn how to drive safely on their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s why we want to tackle careless driving with proportionate sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 14 June, the government consulted on proposals to make careless driving a fixed penalty offence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorists who commit less severe examples of the offence - such as driving too close to another vehicle - would be offered training to help them improve their safety skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if anyone knows the benefits of driver education and training, then it’s this Institution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You understand the positive impact it can have on road safety by preventing collisions and crashes from taking place in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="older-drivers"&gt;Older drivers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also recognise the impact of changing demographics on motoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so do I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Simon pointed out, with an ageing population the number of older drivers on our roads is set to increase over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the report you’ve just launched about older drivers is a welcome contribution to the on-going debate about what this might mean for road safety and road users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the overall aim must be to maintain a balance between freedom of movement for older drivers and road safety for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; is not considering compulsory testing for older drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I’m concerned the crucial factor for road safety is not age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters is skills and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters is the physical and mental fitness of the driver to drive competently and safely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that applies to young drivers as well as older drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognise that we have to do everything we can to make sure young motorists are as safe as they can be on our highways, whether they are driving on the motorway, through town or along country lanes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the safety and ability of young drivers is a key priority for the government which is why we have adapted the driving test to reflect real conditions on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of ongoing measures to reduce the risks of accidents, the department is working with young people, the insurance industry, and other partners to identify what more can be done - and we are considering several options to ensure that newly qualified drivers are properly prepared and able to drive safely &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the use of telematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-car technology like this means insurers now have a real time data feed which allows them to see an individual’s driving behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some evidence suggests that young drivers could see their annual premiums fall by 20% more with a black box installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But research so far also shows that telematics can significantly reduce crash rates and levels of risky driving behaviours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome the increasing number of insurers who are making use of this technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are supportive of any measures that make driving safer and also want to see improvements in young driver safety reflected in their insurance premiums. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="closing-remarks"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I was always taught that there isn’t much point in silent gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as well as thanking everyone here for your hospitality today, I’d also like to say a big ‘thank-you’ to the Institute itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you don’t just campaign for safer roads - you actively do something to make them a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than half a century you have raised driving and riding standards and improved the skills of road users, both on two wheels and four wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down the years you have helped to prevent accidents, save lives and make Britain’s highways some of the safest on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as the Road Safety Minister, I want to pay tribute to everyone at the Institute - your hard work and your expertise makes a real and lasting difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK Air-Rail Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along, it’s a genuine pleasure to be here this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="no-nation-was-ever-ruined-by-trade"&gt;No nation was ever ruined by trade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Benjamin Franklin, one of America’s founding fathers, who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No nation was ever ruined by trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That statement was spot on when Ben Franklin made it back in the 18th century and it is spot on today, in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade is Britain’s economic lifeblood. We’re an island nation that’s at our best when we’re a trading nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the very reason this government is re-balancing our economy - moving Britain from a ‘spend and borrow’ past to a ‘make and sell’ future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if they’re going to trade, then our entrepreneurs have to connect - connect with customers and markets, connect with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the modern world that usually means a business trip and a seat on a plane - which also means a journey to an airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why air-rail links matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the theme of your conference rightly reminds us, these links are all about ‘connecting for growth’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now ‘growth’ is the word on everyone’s lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s hardly surprising in these testing times of a Eurozone crisis, a fragile global economy and a record-breaking inherited debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while there is sill a long way to go, recent economic figures show we are moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do think there is a tendency in some quarters to talk about growth as though it’s an abstract concept - something that’s separate and stand-alone; something with a life-force all of its very own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost as though some commentators believe growth will magically appear of its own volition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that it’ll come about if you say the word often enough, or you want it badly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well actually, out there in the real world, you can’t talk or wish an economy into growing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t wave a wand and conjure up growth from thin air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can’t sit back and wait for it to fall in your lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth comes through hard slog: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the competitive company and the skilled workforce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the inventors and innovators &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the risk takers and wealth creators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and yes… a supportive and empowering government &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is who and what drives growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s where transport can play such a massive part - by providing the vital connections that help to support and sustain growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the bottom line is - the government understands the overriding economic imperative of modernising our railways, our airports and the links between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="railways"&gt;Railways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me take each of those areas in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the railways, where we’re engaged in a massive effort to renew and rebuild Britain’s rail networks - and just this summer we announced a new rail investment programme worth more than £9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re driving through landmark projects like Crossrail, Thameslink and the Northern Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to electrify more than 850 miles of track, compared to the 10 miles electrified by the last administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, right across the country, we’re making rail travel a whole lot better with new services and extra carriages, more seats and faster journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our focus doesn’t begin and end with the conventional railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also recognise the huge potential benefits of high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know that our country and our economy need more than a high speed line - they need a high speed network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what we’re going to build with &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only links London and Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also speeds further north to Manchester and Leeds, and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only opens up business opportunities at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also opens up business opportunities abroad by ensuring passengers have an opportunity to connect up with the Channel Tunnel rail link (HS1) and Heathrow airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will, of course, give people much quicker journey times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is so much more than simply a faster way to get from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; also means more capacity and better connected cities and regions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which, in turn, means that British businesses will be able to use it to exploit new markets, win new customers and attract new investment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will create and support tens of thousands of jobs and so help to power up the recovery and put people back to work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also help to deliver better life chances for millions of people by opening up access to employment opportunities and essential services like education and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s even a persuasive environmental case for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because it will offer people and businesses a high speed, low carbon alternative to short-haul flying and long-distance motoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no exaggeration to say that &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will transform the way we live and work every bit as much as it transforms the way we travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So make no mistake - the government’s commitment to this game-changing project is full on and flat out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="airports"&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now turn to the subject of airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Wright Brothers defied gravity in a box-shaped biplane made of spruce and covered in cotton, air travel has shrunk our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in doing so, it has also broadened our horizons, personal and business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So airports have a front and centre role in keeping our country prosperous, as well as keeping it connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we’re working hard to make sure the aviation sector continues to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the Civil Aviation Bill, legislation that will improve the passenger experience by reforming the 25 year old set of regulations that currently govern our main airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve consulted on our draft Aviation Policy Framework - a framework that forms the basis for future sustainable aviation growth in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, to increase reliability and reduce delays, we’ve been trialling operational freedoms at Heathrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thinking ahead too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to make sure that the future of aviation in Britain is one where our airports are globally competitive and where you can connect to places all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m not talking about the future as just the next 4 or 5 years, but in terms of the next 4 and 5 decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aviation faces long-term challenges that require long-term solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lots of people and lots of organisations have ideas about what those solutions should look like including, I’m sure, many of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports’ Commission to explore the evidence, consider the options and make recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Howard has now named the members of his commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its terms of reference have been published. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job of work is underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so let me be clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is determined to build the consensus needed to deliver a lasting solution to this country’s aviation needs, and we believe that the Airports’ Commission is the way to do precisely that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="air-rail-links"&gt;Air-rail links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you take a look at this country’s major airports you will probably notice any number of things that mark them out and make them unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look again though and you’ll also see there are 2 things they have in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they act as global gateways to new markets and new customers - which means they are not just national transport assets, they are national economic assets too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But second, they’re set to become much easier places to get to and fly from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because we’re making real and lasting improvements to those crucial connections between the train and the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me highlight some of the key investments and modernisations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;electrification of the Midland Mainline improves access to Luton, while Valleys electrification improves access to Cardiff Airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;electrification and capacity enhancements between Leamington and Coventry enables more Crosscountry trains to run via Birmingham Airport &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extra platform capacity at Redhill means more opportunity for Gatwick services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in Greater Manchester the Metrolink tram extension is due to open in 2016 and will take passengers from the city centre into Manchester Airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as part of the Northern Hub improvements, there will be an extra platform at Manchester Airport, which will allow more and longer trains to serve the airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;investment in the Ordsall Chord and additional platforms at Piccadilly station means that trains from Bradford, Halifax and Rochdale will be able to get to Manchester Airport for the first time &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new £500 million rail link will give direct western access to Heathrow Airport and is expected to cut passenger journey times from the Thames Valley, the south-west, Wales and the west Midlands by around half an hour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;once it’s completed, Crossrail will provide new services linking Heathrow with the West End, the City of London and Canary Wharf.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thanks to Thameslink, Gatwick will get new direct services to destinations north of London, such as Cambridge, Stevenage and Welwyn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, not only will &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; make it much easier for passengers from London and the south-east to get to Birmingham Airport… &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will also mean that people and businesses in the Midlands and the north of England get improved access to Heathrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an impressive list of projects and programmes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if you add it all up, what you get are train services that work for rail passengers and air passengers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks"&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay - whenever I make a speech I’m always conscious of the words of President Bill Clinton who gave the following advice about public speaking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;if you can’t say what you want to say in 20 minutes or less, you should go away and write a book about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m sure that lovers of literature everywhere will be greatly relieved to know that I have no plans whatsoever to be an author - which means it’s time for me to conclude my speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I finish up though there’s something I want you to know, and it’s this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting for growth isn’t just at the top of your priority list – it’s right at the heart of our transport policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seamless air-rail journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better, faster, closer links between the station platform and the check-in desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s our vision, that’s our ambition and, step by step, that’s what we’re delivering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Cash boost to get England cycling</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cities, towns and villages across England are set to benefit from an extra £20 million for cycle infrastructure.  The new funding was announced today by Transport Minister Norman Baker, at a conference in Leicester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new funding will help people take to two wheels.  Projects could include better cycle facilities at railway stations, improved cycle links, or projects to improve the layout of road junctions to make them more cycle-friendly. Previous investment has seen some great projects making a real difference in communities, including better cycle routes from residential areas to schools to encourage the next generation of cyclists to cycle more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s conference in Leicester, attended by Public Health Minister Anna Soubry and Norman Baker, explores how councils’ health and transport officials can work better together to deliver better options for cycling and walking in their local areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cycling is great for your health, the economy, and for the environment so we are determined to make it easier for people to cycle whether for leisure, getting to the shops or as part of their commute to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Following the success of the Olympics, there is a huge appetite for more cycling provision from the travelling public and we need to capitalise on this enthusiasm at local and national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That is why we are investing £20 million in cycling infrastructure and getting councils to bring an end to silo working in their offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Health Minister Anna Soubry said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Being active helps us stay healthy and protects against life threatening conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cycling is a great way for adults to get their recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week and this funding will help encourage more people to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £20 million announced today is in addition to £30 million already announced for similar projects this year which drew in an additional £15 million in matched funding from local sources.  The projects to be funded will be announced later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/additional-funding-for-cycling-infrastructure"&gt;written statement&lt;/a&gt; was laid in Parliament this morning &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence today also published new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nice.org.uk/"&gt;guidance on public health for local authorities&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Additional funding for cycling infrastructure</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coalition Government has today made available an additional £20m for our existing infrastructure projects to support cycling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding will increase the total available for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Community Linking Places Fund (in addition to the £15m announced on 7 February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improving cycle safety at junctions (in addition to the £15m announced on 26 June 2012)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Community Linking Places Fund is primarily for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure, facilities and links. This includes improving access to the rail network by bicycle. In addition the fund aims to support jobs, enhance access to employment and encourage greater use of more environmentally friendly transport.   Projects currently being supported were announced on 6 March 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment in junctions - for use by English local authorities outside London - will help to tackle accident hotspots where cyclists have been killed or seriously injured, or are deemed to be at greater risk.  Local authorities are currently submitting bids for funding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand from local authorities, Sustrans and train operating companies, who are delivering the infrastructure, has been high.  An increase of £20m to the total funding available will allow the Government to support more high quality proposals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of the projects to be supported under the additional funding will be published early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Speed limit exemption for life-saving services</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proposals to allow drivers from a wider range of emergency services to break the speed limit in order to save lives have been published today for consultation by Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police, fire and ambulance services are already allowed to exceed speed limits in the course of their emergency response duties and this is not changing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3 month consultation exercise will examine the possibility of extending the exemption to other services including those carrying organs for transplant, bomb disposal units and coastguard vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will also look at amending road safety legislation so that emergency drivers would be required by law to complete high-speed training before exceeding the limit. But this will not place any additional burden on police, fire and ambulance services which already run an effective voluntary training scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Police, fire and ambulance service drivers are highly trained individuals who are at times required to exceed the speed limit in order to save lives. It is only right that we look at allowing other services whose duties can mean the difference between life and death to exceed the speed limit when responding to emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is also time to look at the legal requirements of emergency vehicle training so we can build on the rigorous standards the police, fire and ambulance services have already applied through their code of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While emergency service drivers are not exempt from the offences of dangerous and careless driving, the current legislation allows drivers in some circumstances to break speed limits legally as well as exempting them from certain traffic regulations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation document can be viewed on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/speed-limit-exemptions"&gt;DfT website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Services currently exempt from speed limits include Police, the Fire Service, the Ambulance Service and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (shortly to be replaced by the National Crime Agency)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The full list of services who have expressed an interest in being exempt are listed within section 5 of the consultation document, they include Ministry of Defence bomb disposal units, fire (other than for fire and rescue authorities which are covered), conveyance of human tissue for transplant, blood transfusion, mountain rescue, mine rescue, radiation emergencies, coastguard and lifeboat launching&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The emergency services set up a joint emergency services’ speed limit exemption driver training group to develop their procedures. It also includes representatives from the Driving Standards Agency, the Institute of Advanced Motoring and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. It has developed a Code of Practice which is based around current best practice for each of the exempt organisations and reflects what is being taught there, recognising that there are organisation specific competencies. The consultation proposes using this Code of Practice as the basis for the regulated standards for the mandatory training courses to be used following the proposed legislative change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The consultation includes a set of criteria designed to establish the rationale of each request, balancing the operational need for the exemption against any potential road safety risk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The consultation proposes amending the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 and make any legal exemption dependent on drivers attaining the core competencies identified in the Emergency Services’ Code of Practice&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Widespread support for greater rail devolution</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passengers and local communities could achieve better rail services and value for money for taxpayers if they have more say on how their railways are run, according to responses to a government consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feedback published today also reveals widespread support for rail devolution. The consultation asked individuals, regional groups and interested organisations to give their views on how devolution might work and what the benefits were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rail Minister Simon Burns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are determined to provide the best possible rail services for passengers and ensure that we reduce the cost of running our railways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ensuring decisions are taken by those best placed to make them – those who live and work in those areas – could make certain not only that services are planned to maximise value for money for taxpayers but that passengers get services they need and want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation also revealed enthusiastic expressions of interest in helping to manage the railways from regional groups in London, the West Midlands and the north of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responses highlighted the success of regions where the operation of rail services has already been devolved, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merseyside, where Merseytravel has been responsible for the management of rail services since 2003&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London, where Transport for London has been responsible for the operation of London Overground services since 2007&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scotland and Wales, where the operation of regional services is managed by the Scottish government and the Welsh Assembly government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses also showed support for transport models specifically designed for particular regions on the basis of local geography and the structure of local networks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A consultation document, ‘Rail decentralisation’, was published on 8 March 2012. Comments were invited by the end of June 2012. This is available on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/rail-decentralisation-devolving-decision-making-on-passenger-rail-services-in-england"&gt;the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Department for Transport’s response to the rail decentralisation consultation is available on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/rail-decentralisation-devolving-decision-making-on-passenger-rail-services-in-england"&gt;the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government remains committed to seeking to implement an appropriate form of decentralisation in those parts of England where it is sensible to do so. Following the responses to the consultation, &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; will continue informal discussions with those bodies who have submitted proposals or firm expressions of interest. It will consider further a number of issues that need to be resolved in order to proceed with any decentralisation agreement, subject to any changes to franchising policy which may emerge from the Brown review of the rail franchising programme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most train services are specified, procured and funded centrally by the Department for Transport in London. A public consultation has shown broad support for devolving greater responsibility for local rail services to local authorities, Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs) and Transport for London, where conditions are right&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proposals for decentralisation have been received from the Rail in the North consortium comprising Transport for Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire PTE with York City Council and South Yorkshire PTE; Centro and Transport for London&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expressions of interest have been received from West of England Partnership (the Greater Bristol area), Devon and Cornwall Councils, Merseytravel, the Association of North East Councils and Cumbria County Council&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is envisaged that interested bodies will be ready to submit formal proposals in the first half of next year. In the meantime, the Department for Transport will continue informal discussions with these bodies as they prepare and consult on their formal proposal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Around 70% of respondents to the consultation said they supported devolution of powers to manage the railways to regional bodies&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transcript"&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello and thank you for the opportunity to put on record coalition government’s commitment to high speed rail, and its determination that all parts of our country, including of course Scotland, should benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing demand for inter-city rail travel is putting increasing pressure on existing infrastructure. Without planning for additional capacity, passengers face the prospect of increasingly crowded and more unreliable services. To be clear, the primary, though not the only, justification for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a clear need for extra capacity north to south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans for a high speed rail network from London to the West Midlands and on to Leeds and Manchester will be the backbone of a new transport system for the 21st century.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2026, Phase 1 of High Speed 2 will link London and Birmingham. Comfortable trains travelling at 225 miles per hour will cut the journey time to just 45 minutes, compared to the 84 minutes it currently takes. Importantly for Scotland, the first phase of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will provide connections to the existing network at Birmingham, and also link &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; to &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt;, opening up the opportunities for through trains to run from Scotland to Paris and Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completion of the Y network to Leeds and Manchester will further spread the benefits of high speed rail across the country, increasing capacity and enhancing connectivity all the way to Scotland by relieving pressure on the most congested southern end of the line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition agreement makes it clear that our ultimate goal is a genuinely national network, with high speed services from London to the Midlands and the north, including Scotland. We see phases one and two of the High Speed 2 project as the best way to make progress towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport ministerial team is very much engaged in the question of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; as it affects and, indeed, benefits Scotland. I visited Glasgow last year, the former Secretary of State went in March this year, and the current Secretary of State intends to visit later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last month we announced the launch of a study on ways to get fast journeys further north and to Scotland, making sure that the north-east benefits too. The aim is to fully understand and articulate transport needs in Scotland and the north of England, setting out the remit for any future work, using completion of the ‘Y’ network as a starting point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study won’t start with any preconceptions but will be open to all options that offer good value for money to the taxpayer. This may include a full high speed solution, upgrades to existing infrastructure, or a combination of the two.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands today the network is expected to deliver up to £50 billion of business benefits alone and that will be felt very much in Scotland and the north of England as well as the South. The claim by some opponents of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; that better and faster transport links between north and south will see economic activity pulled into London and away from the UK’s other great cities is defeatist and misguided, and out of line with public opinion. The further north you go, the louder are the voices in support of high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing Edinburgh and Glasgow closer to London as well as the cities of the midlands and the north of England will undoubtedly boost growth across all of our major conurbations. That confidence is based on the evidence from our European neighbours, who began their high speed rail journey a generation before we had even started arguing about our first 67 mile stretch of high speed track from the channel tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With passengers enjoying faster journeys, there has been more extensive modal shift between rail and air as the train becomes the mode of choice for more travellers. High speed rail is already greener than flying and the gap between the two modes will widen as we make progress in decarbonising the sources of our electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will benefit every type of traveller, not just on the new network, but on existing lines too, freeing up more space and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, not only will high speed rail help boost the Scottish economy and support thousands of jobs in Scotland and throughout the UK, it gives us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the economic geography of the whole country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever way you look at it, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a national scheme in the national interest driven by a national government. Realising the full benefits of high speed rail for Scotland is crucial to the economic wellbeing of the whole country, and I can assure you we will continue to work very closely with our partners in Scotland to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Speed limit exemptions for emergency vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department has today published a consultation paper on Speed Limit Exemptions for vehicles used for emergency purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation paper proposes that Section 19 of the Road Safety Act (2006) is brought into effect. Section 19 allows the Secretary of State for Transport to designate other vehicle purposes as being exempt from speed limits in certain circumstances and if drivers of said vehicles complete successfully a “high-speed training course”.  Section 19 replaces Section 87 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act (1984) in relation to exemptions from speed limits for certain vehicle purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department recognises that there are certain vehicle purposes that the wider public may well consider as having a speed limit exemptions but which do not currently.  These include, for example, vehicles used to carry human tissue for transplant, mountain rescue teams, bomb disposal squads and others listed in the consultation document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branches of the Emergency Services (Police, Fire Service &amp;amp; Ambulance Service) are currently exempt from speed limits and provide appropriate training to their staff.  No additional requirements will be placed on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has worked with representatives of the police, fire and rescue, NHS ambulance services, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and road safety stakeholders on the development of standards for driver training.   This led to the creation of a code of practice based on the principles applied in each organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department seeks to identify the core competencies specified in the code of practice and include them in regulations. It also proposes that the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) will take responsibility for the accrediting and quality assuring training providers seeking to provide high speed driver training courses, against the competences identified in the code of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration within the consultation document is to exempt paramedics and other medical personnel from the requirements to wear seatbelts in the back of ambulances, particularly when providing emergency treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Green light for Weston transport improvements</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on a new package of public transport and road improvement measures in Weston-super-Mare can now start after receiving final approval from Local Transport Minister Norman Baker today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme will support economic growth in Weston-super-Mare and reduce congestion in the town centre. The work will also improve links between local roads and the M5 motorway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improvements to increase capacity of the M5 Junction 21&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new link road for buses to access Worle railway station&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bus priority measures at junctions and bus only sections to improve bus access to the south of Worle Station, linking it with regeneration areas at Weston Airfield and Locking Parklands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new 320 space car park with a bus interchange, drop-off and cycle facilities together with improvements to the north-side car park at Worle Station&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increased capacity between the town centre and the regeneration areas through road widening and new routes for pedestrians and cyclists as well as bus priority measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a great scheme that will support employment, reduce congestion and make it easier for people using public transport in and around Weston-super-Mare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The £10.4 million we are putting into this scheme shows that the coalition government is serious about investing in the infrastructure the country and the region needs to drive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Weston package scheme was one of the schemes given funding approval last year as part of the Spending Review process.  Work is currently planned to start in March 2013 with the package scheduled to open in April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today’s announcement grants full (final) approval to the Weston package scheme enabling work to begin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The package of measures, promoted by North Somerset Council, is scheduled to open in April 2014.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Crucial road improvements to be delivered twice as fast</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorists and hauliers will benefit from increased capacity on England’s motorways by spring 2015 thanks to the acceleration of three upgrades, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will be delivered in this spending review period rather than the next, as the government introduces major improvements to the way road schemes are planned and built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new way of working should in future see lanes added to motorways in up to half the time it normally takes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three schemes being accelerated are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M3 J2 to 4a, Surrey &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;M6 J10a to 13, West Midlands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;M1 J28 to 31, Derbyshire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vital improvements to A160/A180 route to the Port of Immingham will also start construction sooner than originally planned in the summer of 2015 and completed autumn 2016 - cutting 18 months off the original construction timetable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am determined to cut the time it takes to upgrade our roads in half by dismantling procedures that have slowed us down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Together these schemes will increase capacity for millions of road users by 72 miles. My ambition is that in future all major road schemes will be accelerated, tackling congestion more quickly and boosting the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a keynote speech to the &lt;abbr title="Confederation of British Industry"&gt;CBI&lt;/abbr&gt; yesterday, the PM announced that “it’s our ambition to cut the time it takes to upgrade our roads in half”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport and the Highways Agency has looked hard at how to speed up the decision making process and the time it takes to have roads ready for use by motorists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that 1km of managed motorway (using the hard shoulder as extra lanes and variable speed limits) can be built every two weeks, instead of every four. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is expected more complex, traditional capacity improvements on non motorway routes, such as the A160/A180 Immingham improvements, will be delivered up to 25% quicker/a quarter more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commitment to faster delivery means this government will bring forward £75 million of investment forward into this spending review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) There are four schemes in the programme where this new approach to road upgrades will be piloted, these are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surrey, M3 J2 to 4a managed motorway &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the West Midlands, M6 J10a to 13 managed motorway &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Derbyshire, M1 J28 to 31 managed motorway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A160/A180 Immingham dualling scheme - improving access to the Port of Immingham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Surrey, M3 J2 to 4a managed motorway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on this scheme, which was added to the roads programme last autumn, is expected to start 2013/14 and be completed by spring 2015 rather than during 2016. The start of work is subject to the completion of necessary statutory processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest cost-range estimate for the project is £159 million (minimum) to £223 million (maximum). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is located on 13.4 miles of the M3 Motorway between Junction 12 of the M25 (M3 J2) to the A327 (M3 J4a) in Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra capacity will come through converting the hard shoulder to a traffic lane – with variable speed limits helping to reduce congestion and smooth traffic flows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will provide more reliable journeys from London and Heathrow to Solent Ports – important for both leisure and business commuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) West Midlands, M6 J10a to 13 managed motorway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on this scheme, which was added to the roads programme last autumn is expected to start 2013/14 instead of 2014/15 and be completed by spring 2015 instead of during the next financial year – 2015/16. The start of work is subject to the completion of necessary statutory processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest cost-range estimate for the project is £140 million (minimum) to £201 million (maximum). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is located on a 9.6-mile stretch of the M6 between junctions 10a and 13, to the north west of Birmingham. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra capacity will come through converting the hard shoulder to a traffic lane – with variable speed limits helping to reduce congestion and smooth traffic flows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will support the economic development in and around the M6 by increasing business efficiency and improving reliability for business travellers, freight and logistics operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Derbyshire, M1 J28 to 31 managed motorway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on this scheme, is expected to start 2013/14 and be completed by spring 2015 instead of during the next financial year – 2015/16. The start of work is subject to the completion of necessary statutory processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will add extra capacity on the M1 near Sheffield, between junctions 28 and J31 (18.9 miles), which is the primary strategic link between Nottingham and Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra capacity will come through converting the hard shoulder to a traffic lane – with variable speed limits helping to reduce congestion and smooth traffic flows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity improvement will support the economic development in the 7th and 8th largest urban areas in the United Kingdom by increasing business efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Immingham A160 and A180 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on this scheme is expected to start in summer 2015 instead of during 2016 and complete by autumn 2016 instead of during 2018 - this is subject to the successful completion of statutory processes, and the construction budget being agreed (for the next spending review period).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of an original five-and-a-half year programme, our ambition is to cut 18 months off the completion date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest cost-range estimate for the project is £89 million (minimum) to £132 million (maximum). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are proposing to improve the A160/A180 by upgrading it to a dual carriageway and improve access to the Port of Immingham. The A160 is approximately three miles long and has sections of both single carriageway and dual carriageway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the A160 carries around 13,000 vehicles per day, including approximately 5,700 heavy goods vehicles (44%) with road users experiencing severe congestion at times, particularly along the single carriageway sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Road schemes can be delivered more quickly by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;undertaking concurrent planning, design and construction preparation activities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;taking more work off-site and bringing to site as pre-fabricated/pre-assembled units&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;moving toward a 24 hour operation with more people on site working on multiple phases at once &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Tough new measures to tackle drink drivers</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A package of tough measures to crack down on drink drivers has been unveiled today by Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included in the proposals are plans to remove the statutory right to a replacement blood or urine test where a breath test reading is above and close to the legal limit, closing the loophole which allows those testing positive in breath to sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also intends to legislate to allow police the option not to perform a preliminary breath test where roadside evidential breath tests are carried out following the rollout of roadside evidential breath testing devices and give registered health care professionals greater roles in testing drink drivers - both of which options would speed up the enforcement process and deal with more drink drivers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have made great progress in tackling drink drivers and the 2011 fatality figure for drink and drive accidents is the second lowest ever recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, last year 280 people died ruining the lives of families up and down the country so more needs to be done to eradicate this menace. That is why we are taking forward a package of measures to streamline enforcement against drink driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am determined to make the jobs of those who deal with drink drivers easier and less bureaucratic so that bringing offenders to justice is not left to chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, drivers who record less than 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath have the right to demand a blood or urine test - despite being over the legal limit of 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres. This is known as the statutory option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option dates back to the original introduction of breathalyser technology when there were concerns over reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his review of drink and drug driving Sir Peter North recommended the removal of the right to demand a blood or urine test as evidence showed people were using it as a delaying tactic. The government also believes that improvements in the accuracy of technology means that this option is no longer necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/government/consultations/enforcement-procedures-against-drink-drivers-and-other-offenders"&gt;consultation also seeks views&lt;/a&gt; on removing the requirement for a preliminary breath test where roadside evidential breath testing is used. At the moment, when a suspected drink driver is pulled over by police, they undergo a preliminary breath test and are then taken to a police station for a further evidential test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from the evidential test taken at police stations are the only ones used as evidence. Under the new plans, following the introduction of mobile evidential testing devices the police could perform the eventual test at the roadside so the preliminary test would not be required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also want to see a wider range of registered healthcare professionals given the power to take evidential blood samples in hospitals and to assess whether a driver may have a condition due to a drug. This will enable tests to be carried out more swiftly, easing the pressure on doctors who are currently the only professionals with the authority to carry out the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other proposals within the plans include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commissioning further research into the current process used to decide whether a driver banned due to drink driving can regain their licence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;further exploration of how greater use can be made of vehicle forfeiture powers to get the most dangerous and irresponsible motorists off the road, including drink drivers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation encompasses the legislative changes the government proposed in its response of March 2011 to the reports by Sir Peter North and the Transport Select Committee on drink and drug driving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation period runs until 2 January 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile breath testing devices are still subject to type approval by the Centre for Applied Science and Technology and have not yet been deployed.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Consultation on changes to enforcement procedures for drink driving offences</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has today &lt;a href="/government/consultations/enforcement-procedures-against-drink-drivers-and-other-offenders"&gt;launched a consultation on some enforcement issues relating to the current legislation on drink and drug driving&lt;/a&gt;.  This consultation encompasses the legislative changes the government proposed in its response of March 2011 to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100921035225/http://northreview.independent.gov.uk/docs/NorthReview-Report.pdf"&gt;reports by Sir Peter North&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmtran/460/46002.htm"&gt;Transport Select Committee&lt;/a&gt; on drink and drug driving (“&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm80/8050/8050.pdf"&gt;the Government’s response&lt;/a&gt;” ).  The changes covered in this consultation should not be confused with the legislation related to driving with a specified impairing drug in the body, which is currently passing through Parliament in the Crime and Courts Bill.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation on enforcement of drink driving will cover four potential legislative changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) withdrawal of the right people have to replace their breath alcohol specimens with either a specimen of blood or specimens of urine in cases where the lower of the two breath readings provided does not exceed 50 microgrammes (mcg) of alcohol per 100 millilitres (ml) of  breath (known commonly as the ‘statutory option’).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) removing the requirement for preliminary testing where evidential testing is undertaken away from a police station.  This would mean that a preliminary breath test would not to have to be taken in addition to two evidential breath tests, when mobile evidential breath testing devices are used away from a police station.  While such devices are not yet available, it is expected that they may be type approved within the next 2 years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) streamlining the procedure for testing drink drivers and drug impaired drivers in hospital so that a wider range of registered healthcare professionals are allowed to take evidential blood specimens.  This would make it consistent with other policing provisions.
4) the consultation asks for views on whether a health care professional other than a doctor should be able to assess whether a driver may be under the influence of a drug prior to evidential testing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislative changes proposed in this consultation would apply to the Road Traffic Act 1988.  Subject to the outcome of the consultation, we intend to legislate as soon as Parliamentary time allows on the matters covered in points 1-4 above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-proposals-in-the-consultation"&gt;Other proposals in the consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Road Traffic Act 1998 (and other parallel legislative provisions) apply similar measures to the drink drive offence to railways, shipping and aviation.  The consultation seeks views about whether any changes here should also apply to these other transport sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation explores how further use can be made of vehicle forfeiture powers to get the most dangerous and irresponsible motorists off the road including those who drive while under the influence of alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation document explores the scope for further research into the processes for reassessing whether a driver banned due to drink driving should regain their licence. The research would develop the evidence base for longer term solutions in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation seeks views about the way forward on three as yet un-commenced legislative provisions in the Road Safety Act 2006 relating to the training and punishment of certain road traffic offenders.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with the revised guidance on consultations, we propose to shorten the consultation time for this to just over 5 weeks.  We are particularly interested in the views of the healthcare sector on points 3 and 4 and are planning to meet representative bodies for medical professionals in early December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Passengers to benefit from Olympic boost to services</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music lovers and sports fans travelling to gigs and games will benefit from more convenient train services under plans to make it easier for operators to offer more flexible timetables, Transport Minister Norman Baker announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes, which are being introduced after a successful trial during the London 2012 Games, will mean that on special occasions train operators will be able to adjust a small portion of the timetable to better serve passengers without seeking permission from the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Olympic Games were a massive success and proved our transport system was able to successfully carry record numbers of passengers. We helped train operators cope with the changing demand by giving them more flexibility to give passengers the services they needed.
&amp;gt;This has proved such an unqualified success that we have decided to permanently cut the red tape involved in adjusting small portions of the timetable. The changes give train companies the opportunity to ensure passengers are able to plan ahead to ensure they make it to their football matches and concerts and back home again on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Roberts, Chief Executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies (&lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;), said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is good news for passengers. Train companies have been seeking greater freedom to adapt their timetables to suit the needs of their customers and this move will be a big boost for people wanting to enjoy many special events across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes enable operators in England to adapt their timetables to cater for events in the calendar year when changes in passenger demand are expected to be significantly different – such as during sporting and cultural events or during school holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train operators will be allowed to adjust up to 30% of their timetabled services for special occasions, ensuring that more frequent passengers are still able to enjoy regular services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Transport Secretary will retain discretion over all timetable changes and the new measures and passenger benefits gained will be reviewed within the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The General Consent protocol, which enables train operators to adjust a small portion of their timetables for special events, was trialled with Southern Trains from the 17 April – 23 June 2012. This was then extended to all English train operators during the London 2012 Games.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The decision follows the success of the pilots and following consultation with Passenger Focus, London TravelWatch and &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Secretary of State is not responsible for the management of services within Scotland and Wales&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Correction to the written answer to Parliamentary Question 97198</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I regret to inform the House that there was an inaccuracy in the answer given by the then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State to Parliamentary Question 97198 on 1 March (Official Report, Column 450W) about Driving: Licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; identifies poor performing MOT testing stations through a transparent and proportionate disciplinary points system published in the MOT Testing Guide. &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; cessate individual testers called Authorised Examiners (AEs) from carrying out MOT tests, not the test stations. AEs cessated in the last three years are 111 in 2008-09, 90 in 2009-10, and 89 in 2010-11 all after appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; identifies poor performing MOT testing stations through a transparent and proportionate disciplinary points system published in the MOT Testing Guide. &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; can take action against Authorised Examiners (AEs) and Nominated Testers (NTs).  AEs are an individual, partnership or company approved to carry out MOT tests.  NTs carry out the actual tests.  In the last three years, the Agency struck off 111 AEs in 08/09, 90 in 09/10, and 89 in 10/11, all after appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-major-ports-group-annual-parliamentary-reception"/>
    <title>UK Major Ports Group annual parliamentary reception</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction Charles (Charles Hammond – Chairman UK Major Ports Group/UKMPG).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along - I’m delighted to have this chance to meet with you this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="facts-are-stubborn-things"&gt;Facts are stubborn things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Adams, second President of the United States, said, “Facts are stubborn things”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for me, the stubborn facts prove that Britain’s ports are a national asset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every year more than 500 million tonnes of freight and well over 20 million international passengers pass through our ports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they account for over 95% of our imports and exports by volume&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and they employ around 130,000 people and contribute close to £7 billion to &lt;abbr title="Gross Domestic Product"&gt;GDP&lt;/abbr&gt; (Oxford Economics Report 2011)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="our-ports-matter-more-than-ever"&gt;Our ports matter more than ever&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, our ports matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with Britain facing the most serious economic challenge in a generation, they matter more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you create wealth, jobs and growth right here at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that contribution is absolutely vital to the health of our national economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But your economic importance doesn’t start and finish at our borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because you connect our country and our companies to new markets and new customers overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody has more experience, or more expertise, in accessing the global economy - seizing its opportunities, maximising its potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working day and night so that Britain is always open for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making sure we’re a top trading nation, as well as a leading maritime nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s who you are. It’s what you do - better than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s why you are key players. The people and the firms who can help Britain out-compete and out-produce the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="an-evangelist-for-the-ports-industry"&gt;An evangelist for the ports industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I have a tough act to follow in my predecessor Mike Penning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure this audience will agree that Mike was a vocal and effective champion for this country’s ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I want you to know that I’m determined to pick up where Mike left off by being an evangelist for your industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So be in no doubt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trust port or private company&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;small, medium or large enterprise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;north, south, east or west&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will be on your side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name on the ministerial door may be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our strategy and our policy for the maritime sector remains exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-right-environment-to-grow-and-succeed"&gt;The right environment to grow and succeed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m looking forward to visiting many of the ports you represent, to see for myself how they are coping in what remains a difficult trading climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know these are tough and testing times&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as always, your members have been equal to them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the fact that UK ports increased their total traffic by 1.5 per cent last year is a huge achievement when set against the backdrop of continuing worldwide economic difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that suggests your members are well placed to benefit as the economy picks up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, with interest rates at their lowest for generations, now is a good time for stable, profitable businesses to invest for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this government knows that we must play our part too.  And there are 2 main strands to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating an environment in which ports and maritime-related business of all kinds can succeed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making sure that the infrastructure for which government has direct responsibility complements and supports the work you do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’re supporting major container port developments like those already under construction at Felixstowe, London Gateway and Southampton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is crucial if these ports are to welcome the largest container vessels which are coming into service.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ships have the choice not to call in Britain at all if the infrastructure isn’t there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these investments will help make sure that as many deep-sea boxes as possible are delivered directly to this country.  And that the country is ready for recovery and growth in trade in manufactured goods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which UK port will they come? That’s up to you. I’ll be as interested as anyone to see how the competition in this sector plays out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And others will follow. Liverpool, Bristol, Dover and Teesport also have the necessary consents to expand their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond the container sector, it’s imperative that every port is able to pursue a vision for the future - whether that’s responding to the opportunities brought by offshore energy, or it’s tapping into the potential of the tourism and leisure market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, regardless of the business model or maritime market your members choose, I want to make sure the government creates the right environment for them to grow and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="better-infrastructure-less-regulation"&gt;Better infrastructure, less regulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create that environment we’re absolutely committed to investing in the strategic roads and rail infrastructure that serves UK ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes far-reaching improvements to the rail freight network…as part of a £9.4 billion rail investment package announced this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the new initiatives is a high capacity ‘electric rail spine’ running from the south coast ports to the west Midlands and Yorkshire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also looking at ways to relieve the congestion on road routes to and from ports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, we’ve set out a major scheme to boost the capacity of the A14 linking Felixstowe with the Midlands and the North,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most crucial arteries for goods coming into the country and -  together with measures to boost rail freight - this modernisation will help ease the flow of traffic around one of our biggest ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also removing the barriers you face so you can do your job efficiently and profitably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as being responsible for ports and shipping, I also have the title ‘Minister for Better Regulation’ within the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I want you to know that I also regard myself as ‘Minister for Less Regulation’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So believe me, if I find suffocating red tape that’s getting in your way and slowing you down, I will cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And where there are regulations which add no value, I will scrap them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while we’ve already run through the Red Tape Challenge formalities, here’s a challenge that remains open to you: let me know where there is still any redundant regulation and I will try to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="closing-remarks"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the case I’ve put this evening is that our ports have a front and centre role in the life of our nation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boosting jobs and growth in Britain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;acting as international gateways for trade and travel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helping us transform our economic prospects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then you have always been fundamental to this country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours is the industry that helped turn a small island nation into a major global player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An industry with a proud story to tell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also an industry with a great future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s a pleasure to be here this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I look forward to working with you all in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012 UK Bus Awards lunch speech</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you also for inviting me along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a pleasure to be here today at my third consecutive UK Bus Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one for every Transport Secretary since I became a Minister at the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I’m lucky enough to be sharing the stage with Jane (Jane Hill – BBC News).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A journalist and a newsreader, a TV anchor and a radio presenter - Jane is one of the country’s most familiar faces and familiar voices.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have it on good authority that Jane is a big fan of Radio 4’s “The Archers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drama come soap opera that seems to have been around forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters that not too many of the public would recognise in the street&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And people living in a make-believe world which critics claim bears little resemblance to everyday life in modern Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might say this all sounds a bit like the House of Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="speaking-up-for-the-bus-industry"&gt;Speaking up for the bus industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I hope I’ve not just been the consistent Ministerial face at the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; - I’ve also tried to be a consistent voice when it comes to speaking up for the bus industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve said it before and I’ll keep on saying it - Britain’s buses matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are a few familiar facts and figures that prove why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bus travel accounts for 63% of all public transport journeys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;last year in Great Britain buses clocked up 5.2 billion passenger journeys &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, as well as contributing more than £2 billion a year to the economy, the bus industry provides 124,000 direct jobs and supports an estimated 83,000 jobs through the supply chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buses also open up access to vital public services such as health and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, they provide a transport link between worker and workplace, with some two and a half million jobs accessed every day by bus, which is more than by all other forms of public transport combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, increasingly, buses are also helping to safeguard our environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, thanks to this government’s “&lt;a href="/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/background-to-the-green-bus-fund"&gt;Green Bus Fund&lt;/a&gt;” we’re seeing more and more low emission buses on our streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buses that emit around 30 per cent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than standard diesel buses and use around a third less fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And earlier this month I was pleased to announce an extra £20 million for what is now the 4th round of the Green Bus Fund, bringing the total support for this initiative to £95 million since its launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted in Greener Journey’s “Buses and Economic Growth Report” not only are buses the backbone of our public transport system, they can also boost economic growth and cut carbon by reducing congestion and replacing car journeys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="an-industry-equal-to-testing-times"&gt;An industry equal to testing times&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This then is an industry that makes a difference. But it’s also an industry that isn’t short of challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt; and concessionary travel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt; I of course recognise that the rate was cut by 20% from April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also think it’s worth remembering that the Government realised the importance of giving you plenty of time to get ready for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why we gave the bus market 18 months advance notice of the change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me say this on the issue of concessionary travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve made sure that bus operators will be reimbursed so that they are “no better and no worse off” by carrying concessionary passengers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, because, we want the processes surrounding this to be as fair as possible, we’ve also speeded up the appeals mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I know that it’s not easy for operators right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluctuating fuel prices and the backdrop of a tough economic climate make these testing times for businesses and families across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest figures show bus patronage was down 0.3% in non-metropolitan areas and while this is unwelcoming it is far from the apocalypse scene commentators were predicting. Indeed overall, bus patronage across England rose by 0.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also pleased to see that 85% of bus passengers are satisfied with their service. And even in the area of lowest satisfaction it was still 79%. I haven’t seen the latest comparable figures for satisfaction with politicians and journalists but I’m told it’s not quite that high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, these may be testing times but, once again, the industry is showing itself to be equal to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="green-light-for-better-buses"&gt;Green Light for Better Buses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I sense a mood of quiet optimism that was especially tangible at the recent 2012 Euro Bus Expo, which I was delighted to open and where I was able to speak with many in the industry.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also know that there is more to do. Now is not the time for the engine to tick over at the bus stop, we have to keep moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why earlier this year I set out my vision for buses in the &lt;a href="/government/publications/green-light-for-better-buses"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; policy document, “Green Light for Better Buses.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that this report will help provide stability in the industry by reforming subsidy, improving competition and Incentivise partnership working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its heart is a shared vision for a bus service that is reliable and flexible, efficient and innovative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One that offers competitive prices and smarter ticketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus service that gives taxpayers real value for money and passengers a travel option they want to use time and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus service that is successful and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus service that people want to use, not one they use because they have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="young-people"&gt;Young People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d argue that one of the best ways to ensure success and sustainability over the long-term is to encourage much greater bus travel among that section of the market that is literally the future of the industry - young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a challenge that cannot be side-stepped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, just this month the Youth Select Committee published its report on “Transport and Young People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That report called for the age at which young people start paying full fares to be set at 18 across England and for the introduction of a national concessionary scheme to provide a discounted bus travel card for those younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I am looking at this report very seriously and I really do want to work with operators, and also local authorities, to improve the deal for our young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as I said, this is a challenge we have to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s think about all the ways we can use bus services to help young people access employment and training opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s make bus travel easy and attractive for young people by building on initiatives like CPT’s  (Confederation of Passenger Transport) excellent “Bus for Us” interactive website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted that, since I launched it, over 80 of the UK’s bus operators are already signed up to “Bus for Us”  - equivalent to 85% of the bus market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to see all operators on board in the near future. There’s room on top for the rest. My message to the remaining 15% is “don’t miss the bus”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also be innovative about the fare deals and the discounts on offer to young people…and the great work done by Trent Barton in this area shows it can be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s deliver some consistency too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, TCA- led youth concessions are offered in 28 TCAs outside London, and a commercial youth concession is available in 80 TCAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are some good things going on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why is it that in some places there are no concessions at all? And how can it be that in one area a 16 year old might get free bus travel while, in another, a 14-year old pays full adult fare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s come together and work together to support our young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, let’s win over the next generation of bus passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pay-tribute-to-all-the-nominees"&gt;Pay tribute to all the nominees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me return to the reason why we are all here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said earlier that I’m proud to be the bus champion in government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m also just as proud of the people and organisations working in the bus industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, this afternoon, we rightly take the time to recognise some of the brightest and the best in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty two categories in this year’s awards: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals and teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities and  operators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cities and shires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small projects and big projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All making today’s shortlist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all with something in common….excellence and achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, these awards show that the hallmarks of your industry are innovation, professionalism and sheer hard work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also show that, at its heart, your industry is all about people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can talk about investment. And we can debate the pros and cons of one policy versus another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, when push comes to shove, it’s the people in the bus industry who make the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the difference because they understand the needs of the travelling public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the difference because they want to provide a first class service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the difference by delivering real improvements on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s who, and what, we are honouring today….and so I pay tribute to all of this year’s nominees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. They do say that making a speech is a bit like having a fight – any fool can start one, the real skill is knowing when and how to end it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I know you’re keen to get on with handing out those awards, so you’ll be pleased to hear that the “when” has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for “how to end it” it simply remains for me to thank you for your hospitality, to thank you for listening and to wish all those waiting to hear if they’ve won the very best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you and hopefully I’ll see you all next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Westbourne HS2 Alliance dinner</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction James (James Bethall, Westbourne Comms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough the importance of the work the Alliance does to build up a coalition of support for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We value your support for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; and we need other organisations to continue make the case for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; in a positive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your efforts are highly regarded and greatly appreciated, so it’s a genuine pleasure to be with you all this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-only-game-in-town"&gt;The only game in town&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac Singer, the Polish-American author and Noble Prize winner, once told a journalist: “We have to believe in free will. We’ve got no choice”.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s pretty much how I feel about high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I’m convinced that a high speed rail network won’t simply transform the way we travel in Britain, it will also transform the way we live, work and do business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And transform it for generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also one hundred per cent certain that opting out of a high speed future would be a disaster for Britain, a missed opportunity we’d regret for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for me, there’s only one choice that makes sense for our country’s success and our children’s future, and that’s &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is the only game in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bigger-picture"&gt;Bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; debate, we can talk about the line of route, design and technology or even mitigation measures and compensation packages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of these things matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also vital that we never ever lose sight of the bigger picture - the long-term potential of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the brief time I have tonight, that’s what Id like to focus on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="economic-potential"&gt;Economic potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;’s economic potential:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will mean faster journey times, more capacity and better connected cities and regions - which, in turn, means that British businesses will be able to use it to exploit new markets and win new customers both at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also create and support tens of thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; can help to power up the recovery and put people back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="social-potential"&gt;Social potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will help to close the decades’ long north-south divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will help to open up access to employment opportunities and essential services like education and health for millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in a very real sense, a high speed rail network is as much about delivering better life chances as it is about getting from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="environmental-potential"&gt;Environmental potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me then, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; makes economic and social sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can also see a persuasive environmental case for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because I really do believe that &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will offer people and businesses a high speed, low carbon alternative to short-haul flying and long-distance motoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="willing-to-accept-unwilling-to-postpone-determined-to-meet"&gt;Willing to accept, unwilling to postpone, determined to meet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I look at the bigger &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; picture I don’t just see an investment in a high &lt;abbr title="technology"&gt;tech&lt;/abbr&gt;, high capacity, high speed rail network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see an investment in a stronger economy, a fairer society and a cleaner and greener environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why it has my full on and flat commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that building high speed rail will be a test of Britain’s energy and skills. And yes, I know this challenge is as big as they come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also know this country - .its people and its companies, its spirit and resolve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I am absolutely convinced it’s a challenge that we in Britain are willing to accept, unwilling to postpone and determined to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="closing-remarks"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, when I first started out in politics I was told that the Golden Rule of public speaking was exhaust neither the subject nor the audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, down the years I’ve discovered another rule - never keep an audience from their dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, ahead of our dinner and discussion, it only remains for me to say thank you for listening and here’s to a night of good food and great conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister views multi-billion pound plans for the north west</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major upgrade to rail links which will bring over £4 billion of economic benefits to the north west is progressing well, said Transport Minister Simon Burns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister visited Manchester and Liverpool today to see for himself work on the Northern Hub and plans for the electrification of rail lines – both projects could bring up to 30,000 jobs to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Hub will see a new rail link being built (the Ordsall Chord), stations extended and journey times improved while the electrification programme will enable faster, more reliable and greener trains to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Burns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Transport provides the crucial links that allow individuals and communities to prosper and that is why this investment is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Commuters and businesses in the region will be big winners thanks to quicker and greener trains and more services across Manchester. But these improvements will also benefit the UK as a whole due the crucial role the north west plays in the country’s transport system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This investment demonstrates that the government is delivering on its commitment not only to improve the transport system but also to use it as an engine to drive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his visit the minister toured Manchester Airport and Manchester Airport railway station where he viewed plans for a 4th railway platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new platform will increase capacity by enabling the station to accommodate longer and more trains. He also visited Piccadilly station which will have extra platforms as part of the Northern Hub project and toured Tuebrook Sidings, in Liverpool, which is 1 of 13 compounds which will be used to store materials during the second phase of the north west electrification scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Northern Hub is a series of proposed projects to boost economic growth through better train services across northern England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The individual projects were identified in a study published by Network Rail in February 2010&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In July 2012 the government announced it was backing the full scheme. The full package of enhancements is set to be in place by 2019&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s electrification programme will also see rail lines on the Great Western Main Line electrified all the way to the South Wales Valleys. The Midland Main Line between Bedford and Sheffield will also be electrified&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A study by Network Rail estimates the investment will bring over £4 billion of wider economic benefits to the north west resulting in 30,000 new jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press enquiries: 020 7944 3108&lt;br&gt;
