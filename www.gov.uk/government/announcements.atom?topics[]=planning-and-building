    <title>First regional strategy to be abolished</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be achieved when East England’s regional strategy becomes the first to be formally abolished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top-down approach of regional strategies from the last administration imposed centrally set building targets on communities rather than giving local people the powers to plan. The regional strategies coincided with the lowest peacetime levels of housebuilding since the 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning and housebuilding works best when it is locally-led and from 3 January 2013 councils and local people across the former government office region for the East of England once again have control of deciding and shaping development in the places where they live. An order to abolish the strategy was laid in Parliament today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abolition of the East’s regional strategy reinforces the importance of the local plan, produced with the involvement of local communities, as the keystone of the planning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Regional planning built nothing but resentment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is the next stage in the abolition of the whole tier of regional government in East England. We are devolving power from unelected regional quangos down to elected local councils and to local communities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government made clear its commitment to return decision-making on housing and planning to local councils and to end the era of centrally-imposed targets which build resentment to development, and is introducing powerful incentives to ensure communities benefit from development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Localism Act 2011 legislated to provide powers to abolish the last administration’s regional strategies. European Union law requires strategic environmental assessments to be undertaken.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yesterday (10 December 2012) the government announced councils who welcomed new development in the last year will share £661 million from the New Homes Bonus scheme, which pays a cash bonus for every new home built or brought back into use. Over the next year, England’s 353 councils are set to share in the cash payout after delivering 142,000 new homes in the last year, including 58,000 affordable properties, and bringing a further 13,000 long-term empty properties back into use. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In addition the government is getting Britain building and has: 
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invested £19.5 billion of public and private funding in a programme to deliver 170,000 affordable homes, which is on track and exceeding expectations&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;introduced the FirstBuy scheme, which will help 27,000 first time buyers purchase a new build home, and the NewBuy Guarantee, which will help tens of thousands of aspiring homebuyers take their next step on the housing ladder with a fraction of the normal deposit, as little as 5%; leading house builders have recently praised these schemes for boosting the sales of new homes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;identified enough formerly-used, surplus public sector land to support 100,000 new homes, and already sold enough of this land to deliver 33,000 new homes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;introduced the £1.3 billion Get Britain Building and Growing Places schemes which will unlock stalled housing sites across the country&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s reform package is working. The latest housebuilding figures show starts on new homes are up by 18% compared to the previous quarter, and year on year completions are up by 6%. Housing starts are 52% higher than 2009, and recent housing supply figures also show net supply is at the highest level since the tail end of the unsustainable housing boom in 2008.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Town and Country Planning Association conference speech</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;England is famous for the beauty of its landscapes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Yorkshire Dales to the South Hams, from the Weald of Kent to the Cumbrian Lakes, England glories in countryside of which generations of man and nature are joint authors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these landscapes - together with the greater drama of their Celtic cousins - that draw visitors to these islands.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these landscapes that our most popular institution and your sister organisation, the National Trust, was set up to preserve in perpetuity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of England is its finest asset and, for each of us, our most precious inheritance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a conservative in both name and spirit, as a West Country boy and a Lincolnshire MP, as the son of a former director general of the National Trust and the brother of 1 of its conservation managers, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that nothing would do more to improve the health and happiness of the British people than if more of them got to spend more of their lives surrounded by beauty.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beauty lifts, calms, excites, inspires.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is more intoxicating than any narcotic, more soothing than any therapy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Britain becomes more prosperous, we must insist that it becomes more beautiful as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the beauty we seek, and the landscapes we treasure, are not only to be found in our open spaces.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the loveliest scenery in Britain is to be found in our villages, cities and towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to take you on a journey, which starts in my constituency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, the river Welland has snaked its way through the low contours of Lincolnshire from its source in Northamptonshire’s Hothorpe Hills.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It enters Lincolnshire at the point where 4 counties meet and passes through countryside that is pleasant but hardly memorable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wandering painter or poet would not give this stretch of the Welland valley a second look, were it not for the landscape of Lincolnshire limestone that is the town of Stamford.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford is not just 1 of England’s most beautiful towns; it is 1 of its finest bits of scenery.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man-made. Built from stone and timber frames and slate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the aesthetic equal of our most splendid hills, lakes and rivers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where did this landscape come from?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did it spring fully formed from the mind of some 17th century master planner, the brainchild of a Lincolnshire Haussman?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford is, as the Royal Commission for Historic Monuments pronounced, ‘a town of discrete buildings’, each 1 unique. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earls of Exeter from nearby Burghley House provided long leases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the local community of wool, leather, cloth and hemp merchants, apothecaries and solicitors indulged themselves with a great variety of stone window surrounds, doorways, eaves, corner and chimney details.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did so within a broad set of rules set out in the London manuals of Rome educated James Gibbs but almost always used local architects and builders.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford was the spontaneous product of human initiative, haphazardly executed and totally unplanned, motivated by the desire for profit, the love of God and that age-old urge that keeps makeover shows in business, the desire to make your house nicer than your neighbours’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next stop is north of the border, in Great Britain’s first New Town.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, by contrast, was an example of municipal town planning at its boldest and most inspired.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to the economic stagnation into which Edinburgh had slipped after the Act of Union, in 1752 the Provost, George Drummond, launched an architectural competition to design a new cityscape of wide streets, crescents and squares, featuring symmetrical terraces of town-houses as well as purpose-built shops and public gardens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six year old James Craig won the competition and, in 4 stages between the 1760s and the 1850s, he, Robert Adam, William Chambers and William Playfair all stayed loyal to the original vision and developed their own variations on a Greek revival theme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In building their New Town, Edinburgh’s town councillors not only restored commercial and cultural vigour to Scotland’s capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also created 1 of the most beautiful landscapes in the British Isles.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who can resist the melancholy charm of a walk in the rain around Charlotte Square and through Ainslie Place? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would wager that the Facebook pages of recent visitors to Scotland contain at least as many photographs of Bute House and Moray Place as they do of Loch Lomond or Glencoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Stamford in the early 1600s, and in Edinburgh 150 later, beauty came about as a result of the natural human urge to get together with one’s neighbours to build a place in which it would be a pleasure to live and work, to raise a family and do business.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the same generous set of instincts that, another hundred and fifty years later, inspired Ebenezer Howard to build Letchworth Garden City. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I am skating on very thin ice telling members of the Town and Country Planning Association anything about the Garden City movement, when your association was founded to promote just that.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do want take a moment, as a layman, lacking all planning qualifications, to say why, like the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, I believe that we have so much to learn from Ebenezer Howard and his garden cities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genius of Letchworth, like so many of the most appealing towns and cities, lies as much in the spaces between the buildings as in the buildings themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By resisting the temptation to cram as many houses as possible onto the available land and adopting their golden rule of twelve houses to the acre, Letchworth’s architects, Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin allowed room for the organic intermingling of nature and architecture.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buildings are buttressed by front and back gardens, the roads are lined with broad verges and trees, the town is criss-crossed with footpaths and patchworked with allotments and parks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ebenezer Howard himself put it, “Parks and gardens, orchards and woods, are being planted in the midst of the busy life of the people, so that they can be enjoyed in the fullest measure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letchworth and the other garden cities work as living, breathing urban communities because, as an Ebenezer Howard put it, they combine “the advantages of the most energetic and active town life, with all the beauty and delight of the country.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the way most English people want to live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to find a way to build places like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what has been holding us back?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only been planning minister for a few months but I have observed the debate about housing and planning for over ten years and I think I know what is wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are trapped in a vicious circle.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People look at the new housing estates that have been bolted on to their towns and villages in recent decades and observe that few of them are beautiful.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, not to put too fine a point on it, many of them are pig-ugly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Harrisons Wharf in Purfleet that I visited last week.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure the flats inside are nice enough but they occupy an overbearing and unbroken slab of dismal brickwork that is an insult to the community it borders, cutting it off from a stretch of the River Thames which, in Victorian times, attracted day-trippers from London keen to take a pleasant walk along banks of the river.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since new housing estates are all too often soulless and formulaic, and those who will inhabit them will add to the pressure on local roads, primary school places and doctor’s appointments, existing residents oppose any proposal to build new houses on green field sites, even when the land is of low environmental quality.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities respond to the wishes of local voters by putting too few sites into their local plans. And this drives the cost of development land up to stratospheric levels (roughly £3 million an hectare in the South East and East of England by 2010.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers respond by stuffing as many units as they can onto any site and, in an attempt to make the properties affordable, skimp on room size, architectural features, vernacular materials, communal spaces and landscape design.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, because we don’t build beautifully, people don’t let us build much. And because we don’t build much, we can’t afford to build beautifully. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the coalition, and my personal mission as planning minister, is to help us break out of this vicious circle once and for all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to get back on to that confident, progressive path, which created Stamford, Edinburgh New Town and Letchworth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to build beautiful and affordable places once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have we done to bring this about? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles’ first step, in June 2010, was to scrap John Prescott’s blanket density target of 30 dwellings per hectare and to stop the garden grabbing that was destroying the precious green spaces that make Britain’s cities so pleasant to live in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government then embarked on a root and branch reform of the planning system and the creation of the National Planning Policy Framework. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a mammoth task which had to be masterminded by a minister with a mammoth brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, my predecessor, Greg Clark, is blessed with exactly that - as well as the unfailing patience and politeness required to bring the good ship Reform to dock with most of those interested in planning and development still on board.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Planning Framework establishes a few clear principles, which it is now my job to drive through.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That local councils should take charge of development in their areas by drawing up local plans.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that alongside the power to plan comes the responsibility to provide new houses to meet people’s aspirations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through their local plans, councils must bring forward enough land to meet the objectively assessed housing needs of their area over the next 5 years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they do so, they will be able to protect precious open spaces against speculative development.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Secretary of State and I will back them to the hilt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if they fail to take their responsibilities seriously, the presumption in favour of sustainable development will fill the vacuum and make the vital decisions that they are ducking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the Framework, Grant Shapps introduced the New Homes Bonus, which gives local councils additional money for every new home for which they give planning permission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in what I believe will turn out to be our most revolutionary step, the government launched neighbourhood planning through which villages, parishes and other neighbourhoods can take control of their future and decide for themselves how and where development should take place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be talking more about our ambitions for neighbourhood plans after the Autumn Statement.
So the government has acted to ensure that more land is brought forward for development and that local communities have an incentive to welcome new housing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now for planners, architects and developers, large and small, to seize the opportunity we have created and start designing beautiful places, which local people will welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, on the edge of Bishops Castle in Shropshire, Bob Tomlinson and Carole Salmon set out to create a new, contemporary village, a friendly place that people would want to live.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was The Wintles, 1 of the most exciting and enchanting collection of new houses anywhere in England.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The houses are all different.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are unashamedly contemporary but incorporate vernacular features in a bold and imaginative way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They use a wide range of both natural and manufactured materials and make a priority of the spaces between the buildings (both private and communal) and the planting of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wintles did not get everything right first time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which experiment ever does?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not as integrated into the rest of Bishops Castle as some long-standing residents would like. And, to replicate it on a large scale, one would need to find a way to build houses that are just as beautiful and just as sustainable but cost less to build.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Bishops Castle I believe that the Living Village Trust created a model for our future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of which Ebenezer Howard would be proud.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In which, once again, we build beautiful new urban landscapes full of affordable houses surrounded by green spaces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be our goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Lancashire flag flying high above Whitehall</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flag features the iconic red rose of Lancaster, which is the county flower of Lancashire, on a background of golden yellow - the livery colours of the county. The red rose is a symbol for the House of Lancaster, immortalised in the verse “In the battle for England’s head/York was white, Lancaster red” referring to the 15th century War of the Roses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historic county of Lancashire dates from the 12th century and emerged during the industrial revolution as a major commercial and industrial region. The county encompassed several hundred mill towns and collieries. By the 1830s, approximately 85% of all cotton manufactured worldwide was processed in Lancashire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Eric Pickles holding the flag of Lancashire with two Lancashire MPs" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1207/lancashire_flag.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Eric Pickles is joined by Lancashire MPs Eric Ollerenshaw OBE and Mark Menzies&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 2 years flags for all the English counties have been flown outside the department, to celebrate the important place counties play in the nation’s cultural heritage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of other flags has also been hoisted above the building to recognise national days of significance such as the Red Ensign flag for Merchant Navy day, the Armed Forces flag for Armed Forces Day and the flag of the Falkland Islands to mark the islands’ liberation day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has also published a new, ‘&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flying-flags-a-plain-english-guide"&gt;Plain English guide to flying flags&lt;/a&gt;’. This will make it easier than ever before for individuals, businesses and community groups to fly their chosen flag without incurring costs of up to £335.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide provides a clear summary of the new liberalisation of controls over flag flying that were recently introduced by the Secretary of State. It is a simple way of knowing which flags can be flown without the consent of the local planning authority so that communities can continue to fly them with joy and pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“England’s counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been celebrating this patriotic pride by flying a range of flags outside my department over the past couple of years. The new plain English guide will make it easier than ever to do this, so I look forward to seeing more flags flying around the country with the relaxation of these rules.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Dawson from the Friends of Real Lancashire said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Successive governments have confirmed the boundaries of Lancashire, and we welcome their further confirmation by this government, which demonstrates the valuable part that traditional counties play in modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the flying of traditional county flags outside the department’s office will lead to further measures to promote the identity of Britain’s traditional counties. We welcome the flying of the Lancashire flag in celebration of Lancashire Day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geoff Drive, Leader of Lancashire County Council said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re very pleased that the Department for Communities and Local Government is flying the Lancashire flag to celebrate Lancashire Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lancashire is a county with great history and tradition and a bright future through industries such as aerospace and advanced manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“2012 has been an extraordinary year for Lancashire, with the Open Golf Championships at Royal Lytham, royal visits for the Diamond Jubilee, the Preston Guild and welcoming the Olympic torch relay. Flying our flag at the heart of government will be a fitting end to a tremendous year for our county.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relaxation of regulations for flying flags came into force on 12 October 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Measures to reduce bureaucratic barriers to growth and infrastructure</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/growthandinfrastructure.html"&gt;Growth and Infrastructure Bill&lt;/a&gt;, currently being considered in Parliament, will help the country compete on the global stage by introducing a comprehensive series of practical reforms that will reduce confusing and overlapping red tape that delays and discourages business investment, new infrastructure and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals in the Bill include reducing the number of different consents infrastructure developers require. The government is also consulting on a new streamlined ‘one-stop-shop’ service and on reducing the number of bodies developers need to consult on every application. The proposed reforms will deliver a swifter, more efficient planning process while ensuring interested parties can continue to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reforms will also open up the fast-track planning process used for nationally significant infrastructure projects to additional types of nationally significant development. It will be open for the first time to business and commercial projects that are important to delivering growth and prosperity and boosting the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new types of developments that could be considered under the nationally significant infrastructure system include: manufacturing and major tourism and leisure proposals, office development such as research and development facilities, and warehousing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers would be allowed to request that their application for these nationally significant business projects be determined through the infrastructure planning system which ensures decisions are made within 12 months from the beginning of examination. Existing requirements to consult local communities are retained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consultations on these two proposed reforms to the major infrastructure planning process were issued today. (See &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/nationally-significant-infrastructure-planning-extending-the-regime-to-business-and-commercial-projects" title="Nationally significant infrastructure planning: extending the regime to business and commercial projects"&gt;extending the regime to business and commercial projects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/nationally-significant-infrastructure-planning-expanding-and-improving-the-one-stop-shop-approach-for-consents" title="Nationally significant infrastructure planning: expanding and improving the ‘one stop shop’ approach for consents"&gt;expanding and improving the ‘one stop shop’ approach for consents&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Boles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is vital we secure investment in new nationally significant infrastructure and commercial development, and that quicker and better planning decisions are made, if we are to help boost the economy and create the new jobs we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Planning delays help no one. They bring uncertainty for local people and local firms and can deter new investment all together. By streamlining the planning process to make it quicker and easier for these national significant projects to be decided we can ensure sustainable development gets underway without delay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent reforms have already given significant additional powers to councils and communities so they can decide on the scale and location of development in their areas. With this power comes a responsibility to ensure that local planning decisions are efficient and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Growth and Infrastructure Bill will also give planning applicants the ability to apply directly to the Planning Inspectorate where there is clear evidence that a council’s planning service is performing very poorly and failing to administer a proper service for both applicants and local residents.  A consultation recently published sets out how these proposals would work, including the basis for assessing performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>New powers for homeowners and businesses to improve their properties</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new powers will make it easier for for homeowners to make improvements in a way that also protects neighbours’ amenities, says Planning Minister Nick Boles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reforms would, for a time limited period, slash planning red tape, sweep away unnecessary rules and bureaucracy and help tens of thousands of homeowners and companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the 200,000 homeowner applications submitted each year are uncontroversial. Almost 90% are approved but still have to go through an application process that is often costly and creates delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases the current system adds little value yet forces homeowners wishing to extend their home more than a few metres from the property’s rear wall to fill in complicated application forms that can take 8 weeks or longer for the council to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/extending-permitted-development-rights-for-homeowners-and-businesses-technical-consultation" title="Extending permitted development rights for homeowners and businesses: technical consultation"&gt;consultation paper&lt;/a&gt; published today proposes making it quicker, easier and cheaper to build small-scale single-storey extensions and conservatories by extending permitted development rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister made clear that safeguards will remain to ensure any impact on neighbours and communities is acceptable. The new rights will not apply in protected areas such as national parks, conservation areas, areas of outstanding natural beauty and sites of special scientific interest and do not remove the requirement for separate listed building consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permitted development only covers the planning aspects of development and does not remove requirements under other regimes, such as building regulations, the Party Wall Act or environmental legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Boles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These proposed reforms will make it easier for thousands of hard working families to undertake home improvements to cater for a growing family or to build a conservatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Homeowners and businesses must be allowed to meet their aspirations for improving their homes and premises but this won’t be at the expense of neighbours, communities and protected areas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that up to 40,000 families a year wishing to build straightforward extensions will benefit from the proposals, and will be able to undertake home improvements to cater for a growing family or look after an elderly relative without unnecessary costs and bureaucracy. Some 160,000 homeowner applications will continue to be considered through the planning system as at present, including all the larger, more complex and controversial cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals will save householders £150 in planning application fees along with many indirect savings on transaction costs such as professional fees, production of scaled drawings and time spent compiling and presenting information. The estimated total savings on the planning application process is up to £2,470 depending on the level of information required to support the application. If the requirement to seek planning permission were removed these costs would no longer be incurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Don Foster hails localism progress</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Don Foster told delegates at a conference on Tuesday that in just 3 months over 1,600 enquiries have been received by the Community Rights support website from groups interested in exercising the new powers and over £80,000 in grants have already been awarded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister was speaking at a gathering of over 500 community enterprise and social action practitioners held in Bristol by &lt;a rel="external" href="http://locality.org.uk/" title="Locality"&gt;Locality&lt;/a&gt;, the UK’s leading network of community and social enterprises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to delegates, Don Foster said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Localism is at the very core of what we are trying to achieve. Communities know their areas best and that is why we are not just talking about pushing power back to neighbourhoods - we are making it a reality and these figures show that it is happening where it matters, on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“New initiatives such as: the Community Right to Bid allowing people to step in and save the facilities and buildings that are important to them; neighbourhood planning, gives them a powerful tool to help shape their surroundings; and the Community Right to Challenge, allowing them to challenge the way a service is run and even bid to run it themselves, are all vital steps in moving power away from Whitehall and town halls and into the hands of local people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Across the country, communities are showing they have the ambition and determination to secure ownership of important local assets and get new projects off the ground, and today is a vital opportunity to share this knowledge and experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community organisations and activists from across the country will meet at the convention to discuss how local communities can play a greater role in shaping their areas and hear from those who have already delivered ground-breaking projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locality Chief Executive Officer Steve Wyler said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Locality ’12 will bring together the most inspiring community organisations in the country. Within our membership there is an extraordinary reservoir of talent, knowledge and experience which has never been more important than it is today. In these difficult times, community enterprise, community asset ownership and community-led delivery of services offers a beacon of hope for us all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Government plans helping local people to get jobs and boosting growth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles visited Cambridgeshire and Suffolk and saw how local businesses and civic leaders are using government funding to help boost local development and deliver the government’s drive for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While on the tour of the local area, Mr Pickles visited an enterprise zone, a previously stalled housing site and a high-tech research park to see the effects of government investment delivered with a localist approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles began the day by opening a new training centre in the Alconbury enterprise zone, a former airfield and brownfield site. This new training centre will train hundreds of local people to further develop the site. Over the course of the development period, the enterprise zone will create in excess of  8,000 jobs in high-tech research, development and manufacturing. The site owners, Urban&amp;amp;Civic are working with JobCentre Plus, the local authority and local further education colleges to establish a jobs and skills ‘hub’ which will support local people into work with additional contractors and companies coming to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enterprise zone has already delivered a simplified planning process that turned around consent for the marquee “incubator” building in just 36 days and using its business rate benefits has attracted high-tech research and development firm Enval to the area.
Uniquely, the zone will be rolled out alongside a wider residential development which could include 5,000 new homes, public transport infrastructure including guided busways and cycle networks; energy, water and waste infrastructure; community facilities including schools and a health centre; and 700 acres of landscaped green space with over half a million trees planted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his tour, he also visited the site of the Northstowe new town which will eventually provide around 10,000 new homes. Planning permission was recently given for the first phase, which would see the development of 1,500 new homes. Mr Pickles reaffirmed the government’s commitment to continuing to work with local partners to accelerate delivery and remove barriers to the establishment of this high quality new town. By unblocking the site, the government has given a vital boost to local job creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles also paid a visit to the Haverhill Research Park and saw how the New Anglia and Greater Cambridgeshire Great Peterborough local enterprise partnerships have contributed £2 million each from the government’s Growing Places Fund. The funding will enable the provision of infrastructure and site works to open up a 29.5 acre site that will create 350 homes, employment space, a hotel and leisure facilities which will establish 2000 new jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Local enterprise partnerships are unlocking much-needed local growth and providing strong local incentives for companies looking to invest. Using enterprise zones - like the one in Alconbury - and the Growing Places Fund, civic leaders and businesses are helping to create jobs, homes and leisure facilities that people need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is huge potential in sites like Northstowe to boost local economies and we simply cannot afford to have them lying idle because of earlier agreements that are no longer viable. Britain is in a global race today with rising nations like China and Brazil. Countries like ours will only be able to compete if we make it easier for businesses to invest and quicker for infrastructure to get built.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Planning Inspectorate essential to new planning measures</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government recently announced a number of new measures in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/growthandinfrastructure.html"&gt;Growth and Infrastructure Bill&lt;/a&gt; to reduce confusing and overlapping red tape that delays and discourages business investment, new infrastructure and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Boles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“New planning measures will put the Planning Inspectorate centre stage in ensuring we have a swift and effective planning system that helps boost local economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By expanding permitted development rights, cutting red tape and streamlining the planning process we can save householders money and help businesses create jobs and compete.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his first visit to the Inspectorate in Bristol on Thursday, the minister discussed the work of planning inspectors with Inspectorate Chief Executive Sir Michael Pitt and toured the National Infrastructure Division and Planning Appeals Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Planning applicants no longer face threat of double charging</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New changes to planning laws will ensure planning applicants no longer face the threat of being double charged a costly planning levy for local infrastructure, Planning Minister Nick Boles has confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possible double charging has been identified by builders and developers as disproportionate and making key development and regeneration proposals unviable that would bring locally-supported homes and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed change, applicants will be able to amend planning conditions on existing consents to make them feasible without having to pay another &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/communityinfrastructurelevy/"&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy&lt;/a&gt; on the same development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading British developer Land Securities has announced it will proceed with an estimated £350million scheme that will deliver 2,500 jobs as a result of the proposed changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning Minister Nick Boles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stopping this unnecessary double charging is an important step in the Government’s bid to do all it can to get the economy growing by supporting locally-led sustainable development.
&amp;gt; “This is just one of many measures we have committed to in order to unblock barriers to growth and to make the planning system simpler and more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Community Infrastructure Levy helps support growth by contributing to essential infrastructure.  Funds are raised from developers undertaking new building projects and can be used to fund a wide range of infrastructure that is needed as a result of development, including new or safer road schemes, flood defences, park improvements, green spaces and leisure centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft regulations laid in parliament - and soon to be debated - include measures to stop applicants being charged the levy twice, if they amend existing planning consents through Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bill to boost growth and infrastructure goes before Parliament</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New legislation to support the aspirations of hard working people by reducing the bureaucratic barriers that stop British businesses from creating jobs has been introduced to Parliament today to support local jobs and local growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Growth and Infrastructure Bill will help the country compete on the global stage by setting out a comprehensive series of practical reforms to reduce confusing and overlapping red tape that delays and discourages business investment, new infrastructure and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlocking thousands of new jobs and billions of new investment in energy projects helping keep the country’s lights on by allowing existing consents to be varied and releasing £160 million in new gas infrastructure;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating a new optional ‘employee-owner’ status for companies to offer, giving workers a financial stake in their firm’s growth and success through tax-free shares;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preventing unexpected hikes in business rates on local firms over the next five years. Tax stability is vital as business rates are the third biggest outgoing for firms;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting building going on stalled housing sites, by allowing the reconsideration of economically unviable ‘Section 106’ agreements. This could release some of the 75,000 affordable and private homes currently stalled. Unrealistic conditions currently mean no development, no regeneration and no community benefits;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping remove red tape which hinders superfast broadband being rolled out to local homes and businesses, especially in rural Britain facing a ‘digital divide’;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cutting back the volume of paperwork which applicants have to submit with a planning application, which go over and above what is reasonably needed to properly inform decisions about the proposed development;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stopping misuse of town and village green applications to undermine planned development, whilst protecting its use to safeguard cherished community spaces and ensure the protection of genuine town and village greens;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementing the recommendations from the ‘Penfold’ review to remove other over-lapping development consent regimes, where multiple permissions from different government agencies are required on top of planning permission; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speeding up the planning system for large scale business and commercial projects. Where developers choose the fast-track route decisions will be taken in twelve months from the start of examination. Existing requirements to consult local communities are retained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These common sense reforms will support local jobs and local firms. They complement the changes we are already delivered through the Localism Act, from streamlined planning guidance and, shortly, from the local retention of business rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning Minister Nick Boles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Growth and Infrastructure Bill will boost investment and local economic growth. It removes confusing and overlapping red tape, whilst ensuring democratic checks and balances and environmental safeguards remain in place.
&amp;gt; “Britain is in a global race today with rising nations like China and Brazil. Countries like ours will only be able to compete if we make it easier for businesses to invest and quicker for infrastructure to get built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Lord Taylor to review practical planning guidance</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A government review of planning practice guidance is being undertaken by former MP Lord Taylor, Planning Minister Nick Boles announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Taylor of Goss Moor will lead an external group that will look to streamline some 6,000 pages of practice guidance that explains statutory provisions, planning and the planning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Taylor has invited Simon Marsh, Andrew Whitaker, Trudi Elliott and Councillor Mike Jones to join the group. They will be sitting as individuals and not representatives of their respective organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large amount of planning practice guidance currently used - added to over the years and often contradictory - makes it difficult for residents and businesses to engage effectively with the planning system. This review will streamline that practical guidance to make the planning system swifter and more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clearer, reduced set of planning practice guidance will better support growth, help create the homes and jobs that the country needs, protect and enhance our natural and historic environment, and help put power back into the hands of communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review follows the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/national-planning-policy-framework--2"&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/a&gt; which distilled around 1,000 pages of planning policy into a streamlined, easy-to-understand 47-page document. This guidance review will not involve any changes to national policy set out in the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Taylor said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am very pleased to accept the role of Chair of the review of planning practice guidance. I am determined the review will make a significant contribution to the wider work on planning reform, and the aim to make planning simpler, more transparent and accessible for everyone involved in delivering sustainable development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Boles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The planning system needs to be supported by practical guidance that is clear and easily accessible if it is to be effective. Even planning experts struggle to navigate the 6,000 pages of guidance that currently supports the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that Lord Taylor has agreed to lead this review of practice guidance and I look forward to reading the recommendations of his expert group.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Taylor, Lord Taylor of Goss Moor, was author of the Taylor Review of Planning (Rural Economy and Affordable Housing - Living Working Countryside, 2008). He is chairman of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.housing.org.uk/"&gt;National Housing Federation&lt;/a&gt; which represents 1,100 housing associations across England, chairman of the St Austell Eco-Town Strategic Partnership and was, until recently, founder Chair of the Rural Coalition (representing 14 national organisations interested in the sustainable development of rural communities). He was MP for Truro and St Austell for 24 years from 1987, until he stood down at the 2010 general election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Marsh from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/"&gt;Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,&lt;/a&gt; Andrew Whitaker from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hbf.co.uk/"&gt;Home Builders Federation,&lt;/a&gt; Trudi Elliott from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.rtpi.org.uk/"&gt;Royal Town Planning Institute&lt;/a&gt; and Councillor Mike Jones, Leader of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/"&gt;Cheshire West and Chester Council&lt;/a&gt; are sitting independently and not representing their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government pledges £12 million to save British heritage icon Ironbridge Gorge</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government has stepped in to save one of Britain’s most famous vistas - the world heritage site at Ironbridge Gorge - by committing a £12million ‘keystone’ to conserve and protect it, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2229505.jpg" alt="The iron bridge over Ironbridge Gorge"&gt;Ironbridge Gorge is home to the world’s first ever cast iron bridge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Described by writer Charles Hulbert in1837 as “the most extraordinary district in the world”, Ironbridge Gorge in Telford and Wrekin, regarded as the birthplace of the industrial revolution and a symbol of Great British ingenuity, is under threat from landslides and slippage which could damage and even destroy the historic site and tourist industry it supports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding will go to restoring and protecting Ironbridge Gorge so that generations to come can enjoy the landscape and an area that sparked a new age of modernity in Britain and across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site, which is home to the first ever cast iron bridge, sits alongside such marvels of the world as the Taj Mahal, Great Wall of China and the Egyptian Pyramids, on list of world heritage sites and plays an important role in the local economy. Each year the Ironbridge Gorge draws in over half a million tourists from near and far to the area and pumps £20million into the economies of Telford and Wrekin and the wider Shropshire area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constantly shifting river banks and the weight of stone in the abutments squeeze the Bridge, cracking ironwork and buckling the deck. The first reports of cracking in the Bridge were made as early as 1784, and repair and maintenance has become a necessary and regular ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The picturesque 18th century Ironbridge Gorge stands as a monument to modernity and the industrial revolution - a testament to British ingenuity and ambition that has been universally protected as a World Heritage Site for all to marvel at. This summer we have seen just how much there is to be proud of in Great Britain so it is vital that we do not let places like Ironbridge Gorge deteriorate or slide out of sight.
&amp;gt; “Today I can announce that the Government is stepping in with a £12million keystone investment that will preserve Ironbridge Gorge’s place in history as one of the world’s great symbols and a site of outstanding beauty for generations to come, making certain it can continue to draw in visitors and bring money into the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communities and Local Government will pay a total of £2.2million during 2012-14 for the stabilisation of Ironbridge Gorge. The Government has made a commitment to provide a further fund of up to £9.8million in 2014-15 subject to approvals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1986, the Ironbridge Gorge became one of the first group of seven UK sites to be awarded World Heritage status by UNESCO. The designation of the Ironbridge Gorge as a World Heritage Site recognised the area’s unique contribution to the birth of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, the impact of which was felt across the world. It was the achievements of pioneering industrialists including Abraham Darby, William Reynolds and John Wilkinson that led to the Ironbridge Gorge becoming by the close of the 18th century the most technologically advanced area in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention was ratified by the UK in 1984. The Convention provides for the identification, protection, conservation and presentation of cultural and natural sites of ‘outstanding universal value’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK currently has 28 World Heritage Sites.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 There are now nearly 800 World Heritage Sites worldwide and these are added to each year when the World Heritage Committee meets to consider new nominations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a site is inscribed on the World Heritage List, a responsibility is placed upon the community and country within which it is located to care for and protect the Site on behalf of the wider global community and future generations.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Housing and growth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on housing and planning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the coalition government inherited a legacy where house building had fallen to its lowest rates since the 1920s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a top-down planning system that built nothing but resentment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a regime of regional planning quangos that created paralysis and confrontation -  after 6 years of preparation, by the general election, less than 60 councils had completed local plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was no development. No regeneration. No community benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government wants to get the economy growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove unnecessary red tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support locally led sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November, the government published a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/laying-the-foundations-a-housing-strategy-for-england--2" title="Laying the foundations: a housing strategy for England"&gt;housing strategy&lt;/a&gt; to support a thriving, active and stable housing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, we published a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2" title="National Planning Policy Framework"&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/a&gt; to condense 1,000 pages of central planning guidance to just 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housebuilding is up: 29% higher in 2011 than in 2009. But there is more to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, my department is announcing a further series of common sense measures to promote house building and support locally-led economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical details are laid out in a written statement which has been laid before the House. I will summarise the key points for Hon Members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;following on from &lt;a href="https://whitehall-admin.production.alphagov.co.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11300/2204242.pdf" title="Review of the barriers to institutional investment in private rented homes"&gt;Sir Adrian Montague’s independent report (PDF 272 KB)&lt;/a&gt; on supporting the private rented sector, we are providing £200 million of new funding to support institutional investment in high-quality rented homes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thanks to the action we have taken to tackle the last government’s deficit, we are passing on the lower costs of borrowing. We will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to £10 billion to support private investment in the private rented sector and in new affordable housing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we will support up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, flexibilities and capital funding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. The last government wanted to demolish Victorian terraces with John Prescott’s Pathfinder programme. By contrast, we are getting homes back into productive use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in total we will invest another £300 million in these measures to support new affordable homes and bring empty homes into use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we actively want to support home ownership, which fell under the last Parliament despite a Labour pledge to increase it by a million&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we are extending our successful FirstBuy scheme for first time buyers, with an additional £280 million of funding, helping up to 16,500 additional first-time buyers to purchase a home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to free up more brownfield land for development and regeneration, we will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land and empty offices through a targeted programme of transfers from other government bodies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we will work with local authorities and developers to unlock locally supported large sites. Just last week, we were back to unblock the Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet Valley - a major ex-industrial site that had stalled for a decade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working with local communities and councils. But some councils need to raise their game, by failing to make planning decisions in a timely way. Planning delays create uncertainty both for local residents and local firms. So we will introduce a series of practical measures to help speed up planning decisions and appeals, and major infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some complex developments take time to assemble. So we are allowing for developers to extend the duration of existing planning permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are making it easier for developers to change unrealistic Section 106 agreements. A development which isn’t built means no Section 106 payments. Common sense reforms will result in more regeneration, more housing and more community benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainable development should go hand in hand with environmental safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can confirm that we have protected the Green Belt, in line with our commitment in the coalition agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has always the case that councils can amend local Green Belt boundaries should they wish - and we will support councils which choose to. This can include introducing new Green Belt protection around new large developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas. We encourage councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are to protect our countryside, we need to focus more growth in our town centres. So we are introducing measures to make it easier to turn empty commercial buildings into housing. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nation, we have great pride in our homes. We want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements - such as building a new conservatory. So we will be seeking to simplify and increase permitted development rights for householders. Cutting back municipal red tape in this way could provide a particular boost for small traders and small builders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker, these practical measures build on the housing, local government finance and planning reforms already in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving more power to individuals, to communities, to councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing new incentives to support local shops, local firms and local economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering sustainable development and getting Britain building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commend this statement to the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Common sense planning reform to create more homes and boost the high street</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has approved a new measure that will increase the number of homes in town centres and help increase footfall on high streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New planning rights will allow more flats to be created above shops without the need for planning permission. Two flats will be allowed to be created in office or storage space under new permitted development rights coming into force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change further streamlines the planning system, making it easier, quicker and cheaper for people to create new homes in existing underused space. It has the potential to help increase the amount of affordable housing and ensures better use is made of existing developed land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relaxing planning restrictions on creating flats above shops can also help increase the vitality of town centres by increasing footfall and providing a boost to high street regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These are common sense planning reforms that will deliver more affordable homes in areas where there are good transport links whilst ensuring better use of existing developed land.
&amp;gt; “Cutting this red tape should be a shot in the arm for the high street increasing footfall and providing a boost to regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning Minister Greg Clark Mr Clark said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Government is determined to make the very best use of existing buildings to provide more homes as quickly and simply as possible. This change offers real potential to provide more affordable housing and give a much needed boost to our high streets.
&amp;gt; “Ensuring unused space above shops can be used in a better way is one of the many changes the Government has introduced to streamline the planning system and to cut unnecessary bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has already taken steps to improve the planning system through the National Planning Policy Framework and the Localism Act, which are already delivering results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also announced proposed measures to simplify the planning system further by making it easier to temporarily re-use some buildings without needing planning permission, streamlining the paper work needed for planning applications and speeding up planning appeal decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has also outlined a package of measures to help high streets reclaim their role at the heart of our communities. These include encouraging town centres to become Town Team partners to benefit from the support and advice available from the Government and leading retail experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change in permitted development rights applies to A1 (retail units) and A2 (financial/professional services units) commercial properties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current legislation only allows for one flat to be created above a shop without the need for a planning application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new permitted development rights will come into force on 1 October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Cash boost for communties supporting neighbourhood planning</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New funding to help communities bring jobs and homes to their neighbourhood using improved planning powers was announced today by Planning Minister Greg Clark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neighbourhood planning gives people a major say in shaping development in their area. It gives communities the power to help decide where development should go and the type and design of development that can be granted automatic planning permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A £10 million fund is now available to help councils ensure their communities are able to finalise people’s plans for homes, businesses and facilities in their neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 200 communities are already using the new planning powers introduced in the Localism Act to work up plans that can, for example, decide the location of new homes and decide the green spaces communities are keen to protect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils are today invited to apply for grants of up to £30,000 for each scheme to help pay for the costs of getting plans in place. Payments will be paid to councils to help them support and advise groups taking forward neighbourhood plans and to pay towards the examination of plans and a local referendum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Clark said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have seen enormous enthusiasm from communities around England, jumping at the chance to be in the driving seat of deciding the future vision of their neighbourhood.
&amp;gt; “This fund will give councils and community groups working on plans a big boost in getting their vision in place as soon as possible to ensure people can enjoy the benefits sooner rather then later.
&amp;gt; “Neighbourhood planning is making sure local residents are, for the first time, centre stage in helping decide their neighbourhood’s future. It is giving people the chance to plan positively and will help deliver the homes and jobs their communities need to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eden-valleys-plan-a-step-closer"&gt;Eden Valley’s plan a step closer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Upper Eden Community Plan Group has their plan well underway after the enthusiasm of residents to be at the centre of decision making ensured they were one of the first areas to use these new powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area covering 17 parishes in and around Kirkby Stephen in Cumbria has already been designated a neighbourhood plan area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plan that focuses on how and where to provide new housing, affordable housing for older people and better broadband connectivity has now been passed to the Eden District Council for a formal consultation. Local people and businesses will be invited to comment before a final referendum is held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Payments will be made in two payments. The first, of £5,000 will be made once a neighbourhood area has been designated. The second payment of £25,000 will be made on successful completion of the neighbourhood planning independent examination.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details of the Upper Eden Community Plan can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uecp.org.uk/"&gt;www.uecp.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Green Belt provides an important protection against urban sprawl, providing a ‘green lung’ around towns and cities. The Coalition Agreement commits the Government to safeguarding Green Belt and other environmental designations, which they have been in the new National Planning Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eric Pickles takes steps to kick-start stalled development</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expert brokers will spearhead a fresh drive to get stalled housing deals up and running and builders back on moth-balled sites, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles is concerned that too much development is being stalled because of economically unrealistic agreements negotiated between councils and developers at the height of the housing boom. This results in no development, no regeneration and no community benefits at all when agreements are no longer economically viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deals, known legally as Section 106 agreements, require developers to make a financial contribution to the community or provide housing, amenities or infrastructure as part of their planning permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams of intermediaries will now offer a free-of-charge advice and support service to councils and developers and will be available to help kick-start renegotiations of these deals to stop them being a barrier to getting building underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="councils-to-benefit-from-expert-advice"&gt;Councils to benefit from expert advice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brokers will begin work immediately with an initial wave of councils that are keen to address obstacles that are preventing development in their area before working with other councils around the country. The experts will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide technical expertise to unlock negotiations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;act as go-betweens in disputes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;offer access to a range of support services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is today also launching a consultation that proposes giving developers the option to ask councils to renegotiate Section 106 obligations if they were agreed prior to April 2010. Currently these obligations cannot be renegotiated for five years once a council refuses a request for voluntary renegotiation by a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tackling problems with stalled development is essential to getting builders back on moth-balled sites and building the homes we need. There is huge potential in sites to boost local economies and we simply cannot afford to have them lying idle because of earlier agreements that are no longer viable.
&amp;gt; “The support and advice the expert brokers will offer is one of the many measures we have introduced to get development underway and I hope councils grab this chance to make use of the support we are offering.
&amp;gt; “Our reforms to the planning system are already cutting planning red tape and making the system simpler and more accessible to communities and businesses. And further changes we’re introducing will simplify national planning policy even more and streamline the planning application process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils in Leeds, Ipswich, Corby, Swindon, Ashford, Gloucester, Kirklees, Carlisle, Northumberland and Durham will the first to benefit from the support offered by the expert brokers and will identify key stalled sites they want to see back up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And opening up the renegotiation process further will provide another new opportunity to help get developments back on track, provide affordable housing and bring wider benefits for communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers are clear that any renegotiations of Section 106 agreements will not remove the developer’s obligation to provide critical infrastructure or other contributions to offset the effects of the development, and they should not result in land banking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deals need to be realistic and deliverable and will take commitment from both councils and developers to ensure they are delivered swiftly. And councils need to ensure they continue to consider local decision making processes when agreeing new deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams of expert brokers, along with officials from the Department and the Homes and Communities Agency will join together to work with the councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pat Ritchie, chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a sector we need to see as many stalled sites as possible unlocked to deliver much needed new homes. We are currently using our investment to do this through Get Britain Building, while our support in unlocking large projects in the planning system - through our ATLAS team - is highly valued by local authorities and the private sector.
&amp;gt; “So where sites are stalled because of agreements signed under very different economic conditions, we will work with councils to help see how we can get them moving again while meeting the needs and priorities of local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that there are currently more than 1,400 housing schemes of more than 10 housing units with planning permission that are stalled and unblocking these developments is a key part of the Government’s Housing Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support and advice being offered to councils is just one of a number of measures the Government is taking to help boost development. The £570million Get Britain Building fund is tackling the housing shortage and creating jobs and the £770million Growing Places Fund is providing local areas with flexible funding to get the infrastructure built needed to build new homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement is a key step in encouraging all local authorities to consider renegotiating Section 106 agreements where development has stalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2011, the chief planning officer wrote to planning authorities asking them to review agreements. The new National Planning Policy Framework requires councils to take account of market conditions and be sufficiently flexible to prevent development being stalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consultation document on renegotiating S106 agreements can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/renegotiationobligationsconsult"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/renegotiationobligationsconsult&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consultation proposes to amend the Town and Country Planning (Modification and Discharge of Planning Obligations) Regulations 1992 (“the 1992 Regulations”), in relation to England.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glenigan Data, March 2012, estimates that there are currently 1,400 housing schemes of over 10 housing units with planning permission that are stalled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Section 106A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 allows voluntary renegotiation of a planning obligation at any time. Where voluntary agreement cannot be reached there may be a formal request to reconsider an obligation when that obligation is five years old. The local authority must take a decision on such a request. If the local authority decision is not to renegotiate terms then there is a right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consultation proposes that for planning obligations agreed on or prior to 6 April 2010, the relevant local authority can be asked to formally renegotiate the terms one month after the introduction of new regulations. In effect this will mean that the formal period of five years is reduced to between two and half and five years for these obligations. For all planning obligations agreed after 6 April 2010, the period will remain at five years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New statutory tests were introduced for most planning obligations on 6 April 2010 which ensure that obligations agreed after that date must only cover what is necessary to make the development acceptable, must be directly related to the development and reasonable in scale and kind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Government’s Housing Strategy is entitled &lt;em&gt;Laying the Foundations: A Housing Strategy for England&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government has already taken steps to improve the planning system through the National Planning Policy Framework and the Localism Act and recently announced a number of measures to kick-start growth and reduce planning red tape. These include proposals to make it easier to re-use some existing buildings without needing planning permission, streamlining the amount of paperwork needed for a planning application, speeding up planning appeal decisions and reducing the volume of planning guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Get Britain Building fund provides Government investment in developments that revive building. This investment takes the form of loans or equity investments and is administered by the Homes and Communities Agency, the body responsible for assessing applications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Abolition of regional strategies</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the Government’s policy to revoke existing regional strategies outside London, reflecting manifesto commitments made by both Coalition parties in the 2010 general election and subsequently incorporated into the Coalition Agreement. The Localism Act 2011 provides for the abolition of regional strategies in a two-stage process. The first stage, to remove the regional planning framework and prevent further strategies from being created, took effect when the Localism Act received Royal Assent on 15 November. The second stage would be to abolish the existing regional strategies by secondary legislation. However, any final decision on this must take account of assessments of, and consultation on, the possible environmental effects of revocation of each of the existing regional strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Environmental Assessment process is set out in an EU Directive (Directive 2001/42/EC). In March 2012, the European Court of Justice issued a significant ruling on the interpretation and application of the Directive (Inter-Environnement Bruxelles ASBL &amp;amp; Others v Government of the Brussels-Capital Region).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, and before the decision of the European Court of Justice, there has already been consultation with the statutory consultation bodies on the scope and level of detail of the environmental reports. Public consultation took place between October 2011 and January 2012 on the basis of environmental reports published in October 2011. Detailed responses were provided in the course of this exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the decision of the European Court of Justice, in the light of planning policy and legislation that have been put in place since January 2012, in light of the earlier consultation responses, and in order to be meticulous in observing the requirements of the Directive, the Government is now updating the environmental reports and undertaking additional consultation. We are publishing the first of the updated environmental reports: the report in respect of the proposed &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/strategic-environmental-assessments"&gt;revocation of the East of England Regional Strategy&lt;/a&gt; shortly and will place a copy in the Libraries of both Houses. This report builds on and is intended to supersede the previous report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period for consultation responses will remain open for eight weeks. We welcome and encourage all interested parties to respond. At the end of that period we will consider all consultation responses, including those already submitted during the October 2011 to January 2012 response period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks my Department will publish updated environmental reports relating to the proposals on each of the other regional strategies, so that those proposals too can be the subject of additional consultation. In each case there will be an 8 week period for consultation responses. All updated environmental reports will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses as they are published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed revocation of the Regional Strategies may be regarded as a material consideration by decision makers when determining planning applications and appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In respect of plan-making, the National Planning Policy Framework implementation period provides councils with the incentive to get their plan policies up to date and in doing so they can have regard to the policy to revoke Regional Strategies and the new National Planning Policy Framework policies. A local plan document must be in general conformity with the regional strategy at the stage that the plan is submitted for examination but it is open to councils when preparing local plans to take account of the policy to revoke up to the time of submission. Local authorities can also bring forward proposals (for example on housing targets) which have a local interpretation to them in their plans, based on their own sound evidence base where that is justified by the local circumstances. That evidence base is likely to be more up to date than that included in the Regional Strategies. Each case will depend on its particular facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Next steps to improve the planning system and support sustainable development</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further moves to simplify the planning system and make it more accessible to people in communities were set out today by Planning Minister Greg Clark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package of measures includes proposals to make it easier to re-use some existing buildings without needing planning permission including the so-called ‘meanwhile’ use of vacant commercial buildings; streamlining the amount of paperwork needed for a planning application; speeding up planning appeal decisions; reducing the volume of planning guidance; and ensuring planning departments are properly resourced to assess applications promptly and efficiently, reducing the burden on council taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has already taken steps to improve the planning system through the National Planning Policy Framework and the Localism Act, which are already delivering results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the rate at which councils are putting in place a local plan is increasing in comparison to the average over the previous seven years and over 100 local authorities are now working with front-runner communities on neighbourhood planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s proposals will help to maintain the rapid pace of reform by removing unnecessary barriers, streamlining paperwork, and supporting swifter decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Clark said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our reforms to the planning system are making it simpler, clearer and more accessible to people in communities.
&amp;gt; “Following the simplification of the national planning policy in the National Planning Policy Framework, these proposed changes streamline the process of applying for planning permission.
&amp;gt; “Our aim is to have a system that applicants and members of communities can be confident will give a reliable, swift and fair outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making it easier to re-use existing agricultural, retail and commercial buildings, such as offices and warehouses, without the need to submit a planning application, supporting small business growth. A consultation is being published on changes to the Use Classes Order, which determines the flexibility with which such buildings can be re-used. The consultation also proposes allowing so called ‘meanwhile’ or temporary uses of certain buildings to open up premises to new businesses and to bring redundant buildings back into use, in line with recommendations in the Portas Review.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cutting out unnecessary information in the application process to make the system clearer, and easier to use, without undermining the ability for councils to make well-informed decisions. A consultation setting out proposals is being published today.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Following the approach of the National Planning Policy Framework in distilling 1,000 pages of policy into around 50, the next challenge is to review around 6,000 pages of supporting planning guidance. Details of the approach to be taken will be announced shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speeding up the process for determining planning appeals - proposals on shortening and streamlining the process will be published for consultation later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uprating local councils’ planning fees in line with inflation thereby reducing the burden on ordinary council taxpayers, who otherwise end up subsidising developers. Planning fees are set by Government and have not been increased since 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring councils whose planning decisions are consistent with an up to date local plan are not ordinarily liable for costs if their decision is appealed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making technical changes to the operation of the Community Infrastructure Levy including ensuring that developers are not charged the levy twice, on the same development, if they amend existing planning consent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extending the funding to April 2013 to the four organisations providing advice and support to communities leading the way on neighbourhood planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A consultation paper on allowing greater permitted development rights in changing between Use Classes is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reusebuildingsconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reusebuildingsconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A consultation paper setting out a range of proposals to streamline the information requirements for planning applications is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/streamlininginfoconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/streamlininginfoconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy allows local authorities in England and Wales to raise funds from owners or developers of land undertaking new building projects in their area. The money can be used to fund a wide range of infrastructure that is needed as a result of development, including new or safer road schemes, flood defences, park improvements, green spaces and leisure centres. The Government will introduce regulatory changes in the Autumn to improve the operation of the levy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government is proposing to improve the performance of statutory consultees in the planning process by ensuring that there is an effective mechanism for applicants to obtain an award of costs where a statutory consultee has acted unreasonably. A consultation with detailed proposals is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/statutoryconsulteeconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/statutoryconsulteeconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The four organisations providing support on neighbourhood planning are: the Royal Town Planning Institute; the Prince’s Foundation for Building Community; the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England working with the National Association of Local Councils and Locality (the Building Communities Consortium). The further funding will be available until the end of the financial year to enable the four support providers to offer practical and bespoke advice and assistance to those communities leading the way with their neighbourhood plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Eric Pickles flies Falklands flag to mark 'Liberation Day'</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles raised the flag of the Falkland Islands today outside the Department for Communities and Local Government in Whitehall, London, to mark the Islands’ Liberation Day and the start of a new flag flying programme by the Department in this Jubilee year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2161124.jpg" alt="Flag of the Falkland Islands"&gt;The Falklands’ flag outside Eland House&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles has asked for the flags of the United Kingdom’s Overseas Territories - from Anguilla to the Turks and Caicos Islands - to be proudly flown by the Department as part of a formal recognition of the continued important and close relationship with the country. This follows from a programme of flying England’s county flags last year. The Falklands’ flag, which is also being flown outside Downing Street and the Foreign Office, appears alongside the Union flag, which is flown all year round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flags will be flown at appropriate times in the coming months to recognise national days of significance. Britain has 14 Overseas Territories which encompass over 600,000 square miles and are home to 260,000 people - more than Nottingham or Newcastle. The Falkland Islands are made up of over 700 islands with the two largest, West and East Falkland home to around 3,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberation Day on 14 June marks the anniversary of the Falkland Islands being freed by British forces after an unprovoked Argentine invasion thirty years ago - marking the end of the battle in the South Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the ceremony of hoisting the Falklands’ flag, Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, we pay tribute to the bravery of our Armed Forces thirty years ago in liberating the Falklands from totalitarian aggression.
&amp;gt; “British forces put their lives on the line to defend British sovereign territory, the British way of life and the rights of British people to determine their own future. This is was a victory both for freedom and the indefatigable spirit of the Islanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hon Dick Sawle MLA said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This year is an important one for Falkland Islanders. Not only does it mark 60 years on the throne for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, but also, 30 years since the cessation of hostilities with Argentina. As a proud member of the UK Overseas Territory family, relations between the Islands and the UK are closer than ever. I am sure that this gesture by the DCLG will be appreciated by all Islanders.
&amp;gt; “Liberation Day is the perfect day to fly the Falkland Islands flag and we are grateful for Her Majesty’s Government for its continued support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department is currently assessing responses to a discussion paper on relaxing the planning regime on flag flying and allowing people to fly more flags without having to seek and pay for planning consent from their local authority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 14 UK Overseas Territories, 11 of which have permanent populations.  Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands are all in the Caribbean. Bermuda is in the North Atlantic Ocean whilst the Falkland Islands and the Territory of St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha are located in the South Atlantic. Pitcairn, with a population of less than 60 people, is the only Territory in the Pacific. Gibraltar and The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekilia in Cyprus are the only territories in Europe. The remaining Territories, ie the British Antarctic Territory, the British Indian Ocean Territory, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (in the South Atlantic Ocean) do not have permanent populations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
