    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Minister for the Middle East and North Africa Alistair Burt gave a statement on the attack on Shia pilgrims in Nasiriya and the bombings in Baghdad today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was appalled to learn of the attack on Shia pilgrims in Nasiriya which has killed and maimed so many people, and of the bombings in Baghdad earlier today. We denounce and condemn these atrocities in the strongest terms. Our prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families and loved ones of these innocent civilians killed or injured in today’s attacks.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I urge the political parties and leadership to renew their efforts to break the current political impasse so that together they can focus on the reconstruction of Iraq and bring security and stability and raised quality of life to its citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
