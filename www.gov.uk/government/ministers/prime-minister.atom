    <title>MOD shines at the Civil Service Awards</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Civil servants gathered together yesterday for the awards ceremony at Lancaster House in London. Hosted by &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/" title="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; TV presenters Jon Sopel and Sian Williams, the event honoured outstanding individuals and teams across government for their contribution to public services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/news/civil-service-awards" title="Civil Service Awards 2012"&gt;The Civil Service Awards&lt;/a&gt; celebrate and promote innovation and improvement across the entire breadth of central government. They recognise people who are leading the way in these areas and champion them as examples of best practice that can be applied across the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/" title="Civil Service"&gt;Civil Service&lt;/a&gt;. This year 850 nominations were received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Awards featured 18 main categories. The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; was shortlisted in two of them. As well as the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt;’s civilian Standing Joint Commander [&lt;abbr title="Standing Joint Commander"&gt;SJC&lt;/abbr&gt;] (UK) nomination, Staff Sergeant Mark Smith and Staff Sergeant Andrew Laurie were nominated for the Achieving Better for Less Award. The judges accepted the fact that Defence has a unique &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; and opened the competition up to Service personnel as well as civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full citations and a list of all the winners can be found at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://network.civilservicelive.com/pages/view/710933/civil-service-awards-winners-2012" title="Civil Service Awards Winners 2012"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a video message at the event Prime Minister David Cameron said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This summer we showed the world the best face of Britain and your efforts were a big part of that success. So I am very pleased to see a special category tonight recognising achievements in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Britain’s Civil Service is a great source of national pride. Your excellence, innovation and professionalism and your values, integrity and impartiality, honesty and objectivity are rightly respected around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening the event, Sir Bob Kerslake, Head of the Civil Service, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not often we have a chance to celebrate the excellent work we do in the Civil Service. What these nominations demonstrate is that it is a great place to work and what we do matters greatly to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to sincerely thank all of you for your passion and dedication and innovation; it is truly impressive, it is truly great. You should all feel incredibly proud of your achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Olympic Team Award was a one-off category created for the 2012 Civil Service Awards to celebrate individuals, teams and volunteers who showed excellence in delivering the &lt;a href="London%202012" title="http://www.london2012.com/"&gt;2012 Games&lt;/a&gt;. Over 100 nominations were received for this category alone. The award was judged by a panel including the new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.teamgb.com/" title="British Olympic Association "&gt;British Olympic Association&lt;/a&gt; Chairman, Lord Sebastian Coe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a video message played just before the winners were revealed Lord Coe said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The quality of the London Games was predicated almost entirely on the secure, robust relationships that we formed. And nowhere were those relationships more secure and robust than across government. There were 19 government departments that helped us deliver the Games. No organising committee alone can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many of you I know worked long and hard and put all sorts of things on hold to make sure these Games were the extraordinary success they were. Thank you for being such true and trusted teams to help us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting the award to the &lt;abbr title="Standing Joint Commander"&gt;SJC&lt;/abbr&gt; (UK) Olympics Team, Jonathan Stephens, Permanent Secretary at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/" title="Department for Culture, Media and Sport"&gt;Department for Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/a&gt;, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This summer was a summer like no other. It was a great opportunity to put on a show to the world. It was also only made possible by the very best of public service and Civil Service delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Staff Sergeants Andy Laurie and Marc Smith" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1181/CSAwards01.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking moments after receiving their award, the &lt;abbr title="Standing Joint Commander"&gt;SJC&lt;/abbr&gt; (UK) Olympics Team said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are really proud of what we have achieved. We worked so hard over the summer. It’s just recognition of that achievement. The award is not just for us, it’s for our families and friends who put up with us being away from them every weekend for six months and for supporting us when we worked long hours during the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces contribution to the Games was recognised throughout the summer but this award recognises the civilians too. It shows the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; as a team, with civil servants and military working together. It doesn’t matter if it’s in Afghanistan or the UK - we can still do a good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; team was up against Operation Stepchange from the &lt;a href="/government/organisations/department-for-transport" title="Department for Transport"&gt;Department for Transport&lt;/a&gt;, which tested travel and business continuity plans across government in readiness for the Games; the UK Wide Operations Olympic and Paralympic Torch Team from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which co-ordinated the Olympic Torch Relay across the UK; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalparks.org.uk/" title="Royal Parks"&gt;Royal Parks&lt;/a&gt;, which hosted a number of the Olympic events watched by two million spectators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service Awards support the wider Civil Service reform plan. One of the plan’s main priorities is for all government departments to find new ways of delivering services. It aims to transform the Civil Service so that it will have a more innovative and less hierarchical culture, with a much sharper focus on outcomes rather than processes, and will be more flexible and corporate. Many aspects of the plan came from &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/tell-us-how" title="Tell Us How"&gt;‘Tell Us How’&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/" title="Cabinet Office"&gt;Cabinet Office’s&lt;/a&gt; suggestion scheme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; itself uses GEMS, its own staff suggestion scheme, to encourage innovation within Defence. The ideas scheme was launched in 1996 and is open to all Defence civilian and Service personnel, including ex-employees, anywhere in the world. It is the third most successful ideas scheme in the world. Those who make successful suggestions receive a financial reward. GEMS is a key part of Transforming Defence. It falls under the Behaviours and Business Improvement workstream, linking closely with the ‘Be A Leader - Think Defence - Do It Better’ behaviour change work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GEMS also glittered at the Civil Service Awards, showing the rest of Whitehall how we in Defence are ‘Doing It Better’. Staff Sergeant Mark Smith and Staff Sergeant Andrew Laurie, who were nominated for the Achieving Better for Less Award, earlier this week won the GEMS Idea of the Year Award and a commendation in the Most Operational Benefit category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their Armoured Frame Electrical Layout is a training aid for &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/reme/reme.aspx" title="Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers"&gt;Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers&lt;/a&gt; vehicle mechanics to fix electrical problems in protected mobility vehicles. This is currently a real problem in Afghanistan, and this innovation will help the mechanics in theatre to learn how to make faster repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two Staff Sergeants were up against the Respiratory Team from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/index.htm" title="Department of Health"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, which in the end won the Achieving Better for Less Award. The team retendered contracts for the regional Home Oxygen Service. The other nominee was the Property Asset Management Unit which is a shared service between the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.education.gov.uk/" title="Department for Education"&gt;Department for Education&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government" title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;Department for Communities and Local Government&lt;/a&gt;. It maintains the buildings for both departments at a significantly reduced cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff Sergeant Mark Smith and Staff Sergeant Andrew Laurie said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although we didn’t win our category we were very pleased to be nominated. We work with civil servants quite closely and it was a privilege to come here and see the recognition they received. We felt the winning nomination deserved it, and we commend them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permanent Secretary Jon Thompson said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My congratulations to the &lt;abbr title="Standing Joint Commander"&gt;SJC&lt;/abbr&gt; (UK) Team for their win, and to Staff Sergeants Smith and Laurie for their nomination. There was fierce competition from other government departments at the Civil Service Awards this year and the bar was set very high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt;’s strong performance at the Awards recognises our commitment to ‘Doing It Better’, and shows how highly our innovative work is regarded outside the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/piracy-ransoms-task-force-publishes-recommendations"/>
    <title>Piracy Ransoms Task Force publishes recommendations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Task Force was established by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, after the London Conference on Somalia in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 14-nation Task Force, brought together policy makers from some of the world’s largest Flag States (countries where vessels are registered), nations whose seafarers are most commonly at risk, and those countries at the forefront of the military response to piracy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Task Force made four recommendations in its final report to the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia in New York:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a new strategic partnership between Flag States, the private sector and law enforcement agencies that brings together those tackling piracy and those subjected to it in a united effort to break the piracy business model;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop a more co-ordinated approach to information-sharing to provide evidence to pursue and prosecute all involved in piracy;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strengthen co-ordination between Flag States, the private sector and military responders to prepare for potential hostage situations; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage implementation of anti-piracy measures, including greater compliance with Best Management Practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister, David Cameron, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today’s conclusions from the Piracy Ransoms Task Force are a welcome step in the right direction. International action, led by the UK, is starting to beat back in the global fight against piracy. The dramatic reduction in pirate activity in the past year shows how important collective action is, and the recommendations of the Task Force should make it harder for pirates to receive, and to profit from, ransom payments. But seafarers of all nations remain at risk, and we must continue to work to break the piracy business model, with the ultimate ambition of bringing an end to ransom payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK Government firmly supports and endorses the conclusions of the Piracy Ransoms Task Force. Only through the international community working together to break the pirates’ business model will we reach a position whereby pirates are no longer able to receive or profit from ransom payments. The Government will continue to work as a leading member of the Contact Group and with industry in taking forward the implementation of the task force’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>  Life Sciences Strategy: one year on</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="progress"&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report shows that the UK has generated more than £1 billion on industry and private sector investment within 12 months.  This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£500 million from GSK to build its first new manufacturing plant in almost 40 years at Ulverston in Cumbria and invest more in its two sites at Montrose and Irvine in Scotland as a direct response to the introduction of the Patent Box&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£25 million leveraged in from the private sector to bridge the ‘Valley of Death’ adding to a government commitment of £49 million to 64 projects through the Biomedical Catalyst&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£294 million through the UK Research Partnership Investment Fund (&lt;abbr title="UK Research Partnership Investment Fund"&gt;UK RPIF&lt;/abbr&gt;) from businesses and charities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real progress has been made working closely with companies across the sector to ensure the measures in the strategy are making a real difference to their work and their decisions to invest in and remain in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes investing £1 billion per annum through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt; to boost networks between academia, industry and the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="revolutionising-the-fight-against-cancer"&gt;Revolutionising the fight against cancer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Cameron also announced that the UK will be the first country in the world to introduce to introduce high-tech &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; mapping for cancer patients and those with rare diseases, within the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt;.  Up to  100,000 patients over three to five years will have their whole genome – their personal &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; code –sequenced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genome profile will give doctors a new, advanced understanding of a patient’s genetic make-up, condition and treatment needs, ensuring they have access to the right drugs and personalised care far quicker than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also help to develop life-saving new drugs, treatments and scientific breakthroughs, which experts predict could significantly reduce the number of premature deaths from cancer within a generation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has earmarked £100 million: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to train a new generation of British genetic scientists to lead on the development of new drugs, treatments and cures, building the UK as the world leader in the field. And train the wider healthcare community in harnessing this technology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to pump-prime &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; sequencing for cancer and rare inherited diseases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to build the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt; data infrastructure to ensure that this new technology leads to better care for patients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="reaction"&gt;Reaction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Science and Universities David Willetts said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Life sciences is one of the most truly international sectors – so if we are to continue to be a world player and compete in the global race we must do everything we can to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the past year, our initiatives have attracted more than £1 billion of private sector investment to the UK. We can see clear evidence the UK is succeeding in creating the right environment to attract global investment to our shores and continue to be world leader in life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am announcing today that we are committing a further £100 million to support this sector out of the extra money for science announced by the chancellor in his Autumn Statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron has given his reaction to Barack Obama’s victory in the US Presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister spoke during his visit to Jordan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would like to congratulate Barack Obama on his re-election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have really enjoyed working with him over the last few years and I look forward to working with him again over the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are so many things that we need to do: we need to kick start the world economy and I want to see an EU-US trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Right here in Jordan I am hearing appalling stories about what has happened inside Syria so one of the first things I want to talk to Barack about is how we must do more to try and solve this crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Above all, congratulations to Barack. I’ve enjoyed working with him, I think he’s a very successful US president and I look forward to working with him in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a significant moment for Somalia, and an important step towards a renewed political process. I congratulate Hassan Sheikh Mohamud on his victory and welcome the part played by outgoing president Sheikh Sharif, to bring Somalia to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The coming months and years are critical for Somalia’s transition to democracy. Somalia’s leaders must now work together to build a more representative and transparent system, tackle corruption and strengthen security and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

Britain will continue to support Somalia’s people and leaders, so that Somalia can fulfill its potential as a peaceful, inclusive and prosperous nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and Brazil to co-host event to tackle global hunger</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost one in three of the world’s poorest children cannot reach their full potential due to malnutrition.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday 12 August, Prime Minister David Cameron and Vice President Michel Temer of Brazil will challenge global leaders to step up efforts to improve nutrition and reduce the rate of stunting among the world’s poorest children between now and the next Olympics in 2016.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global Hunger Event will help to strengthen these commitments by identifying pioneering new ways of working to tackle malnutrition and bringing in new champions to support the global movement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central part of London’s successful bid for the Games has been the legacy it will create for Britain - reinvigorating one of the poorest parts of the country and inspiring a whole generation of young people.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that this event on the closing day of the Games will mean that London 2012 also has a lasting legacy for millions more children around the world by improving their nutrition and giving them the opportunity to fulfil their potential too.
