    <title>Minister for Europe renews UK commitment to EU enlargement </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister gave a press briefing for European journalists today following his participation in the General Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 11 December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK remains a strong supporter of EU enlargement to all countries of the Western Balkans, Iceland and Turkey. I’ve just returned from the General Affairs Council in Brussels where I was pleased to have a long discussion on EU enlargement. Its conclusions make clear the EU’s continued support for enlargement. This is important, and a message that I hope will be heard clearly in the accession and pre-accession countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Enlargement is good for the EU and one of the EU’s greatest achievements. The European Union, alongside NATO, has been an instrument of peace and reconciliation that has helped spread democracy and the rule of law across our continent, and helped make armed conflict between EU members unthinkable. At the same time an enlarged Single Market, another of the key success stories of the EU, has opened up prosperity and opportunity to hundreds of millions of people. An outward-looking approach and a continuing commitment to enlargement should be seen by all EU Member States as signs of strength and vigour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Enlargement is also good for wider security and prosperity across the continent. The accession of new Member States helps promote security, stability and prosperity across Europe, based on a firm foundation of democracy, human and civil rights, and respect for the law. The focus on good neighbourly relations is particularly important for a region such as the Western Balkans which saw conflict only two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a respect for this firm foundation and its benefits which drives the UK’s scrutiny of progress and focus on conditionality. So the UK is clear that there will be no pause after Croatia’s accession. But equally there will be no movement without progress on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Foreign Secretary visited Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo in October. He set out clearly the UK’s support for each country’s EU future. But he stressed to the political leaders that they needed to take the necessary steps to deliver. I hope political leaders in all of the aspiring countries will do so and that we will see further progress being made towards the EU early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And the UK remains committed to Turkey’s EU membership. We strongly believe that this would contribute to Europe’s prosperity and security, and the EU remains the strongest lever for reform in Turkey. We are focused on making real progress on the accession process in 2013 and we fully support the Irish Presidency in their desire to open a new acquis Chapter during their Presidency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I will attend the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 10 December, and I will attend the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 11 December in Brussels. The Foreign Affairs Council will be chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton of Upholland, and the General Affairs Council will be chaired by the Cypriot Presidency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="foreign-affairs-council"&gt;Foreign Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-russia-summit"&gt;EU-Russia Summit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will discuss the EU-Russia Summit which will be held in Brussels on 21 December. Whilst I do not expect conclusions to be issued, we will aim to ensure that this meeting, the 30th such summit, delivers concrete results for the EU in its relationship with Russia. The discussion provides an opportunity for the UK to steer the EU’s objectives for the Summit and to ensure discussion focuses on concrete achievable outcomes, such as: resolution of the Siberian overflight charges; movement on market reform; positive developments in the energy relationship; underlining Member States’ concerns on human rights and democratic standards; and a more effective Partnership for Modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="western-balkans"&gt;Western Balkans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will review the situation in the countries of the Western Balkans, in advance of the discussion of EU enlargement at the GAC the following day. This will be an opportunity to consider the latest developments in the EU-facilitated dialogue between the Prime Ministers of Serbia and Kosovo: the UK welcomes the leadership of Baroness Ashton on this and is keen to see further improvement in the relations between the two sides. There may also be some discussion of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the pace of reform has recently slowed and renewed progress is badly needed, as well as consideration of the situations in Macedonia and Albania. I do not expect conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="southern-neighbourhood"&gt;Southern Neighbourhood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a discussion on Syria. Further to a UK drive to increase EU support to Syrian civil society, I anticipate that the EEAS will present its vision on how the EU can support civil society in coping with the consequences of the ongoing conflict and better prepare it for political transition. We also expect discussion on the relationship between EU Member States and the newly formed Syrian National Coalition. Having successfully amended the EU arms embargo (and sanctions package) by setting a three-month renewal period, we will make fresh arguments in support of amending the arms embargo ahead of the March 2013 deadline in a way that offers sufficient flexibility to increase practical support to the Syrian opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers may also take stock of recent events in Libya, including how to support the priorities of the new Prime Minister, Ali Zidan, and his government which has now taken office. There will be an opportunity to discuss the provision and coordination of international assistance to the new Libyan authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council may discuss events in Egypt following President Mursi’s 22 November Constitutional Declaration. The situation on the ground is changing rapidly, but we will argue for the EU to respond appropriately to the latest developments and clearly underline support for continued progress towards democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="middle-east-peace-process"&gt;Middle East Peace Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions on the Middle East Peace Process will focus on follow-up to the 29 November UN General Assembly Resolution, including the EU’s response to the Israeli decisions to build 3,000 new housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, to unfreeze planning in the area known as E1 and to withhold tax revenue from the Palestinian Authority. EU Ministers will also discuss facilitating a rapid return to credible negotiations in order to secure a two-state solution. We will reiterate our condemnation of the Israeli decision, underlining the threat this poses to the two-state solution, and stress the need to continue work to build on the May FAC conclusions. We will also emphasise the need for the US, with the strong and active support of the EU, to do all it can in the coming weeks and months to take a decisive lead and push the peace process forward urgently. Additionally the UK will stress the need to build on the Gaza ceasefire and to address the underlying causes of the conflict including more open access to and from Gaza for trade as well as humanitarian assistance, and an end to the smuggling of weapons. The UK will support conclusions covering these points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-us"&gt;EU-US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This item has been re-scheduled from November’s FAC. Ministers will have the opportunity to discuss the EU’s priorities with the US following the US presidential elections on 6 November and the re-election of President Obama.  I expect the discussion to cover a spectrum of leading international issues, including the global economy and a possible EU-US free trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
We also expect Ministers to agree conclusions on Ukraine and the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="general-affairs-council"&gt;General Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a substantial agenda for the GAC in December. There is a legislative deliberation on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union; a presentation by the Commission on the Annual Growth Survey; Preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December; endorsement of the 18 month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece; and a discussion on Enlargement, covering all potential candidates and including the adoption of EU Common positions for the Accession Conference with Iceland. Due to the large agenda, I expect many of these items to be brief and I expect most of the discussion to focus on the preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December and on Enlargement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="statute-of-the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union"&gt;Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot Presidency hopes to secure agreement on a selection method for additional judges at the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union: we have not yet received the final proposal for this.  I remain concerned at the current backlog at the General Court, which is damaging to the interests of British business.  My priorities in the discussion will be: to ensure that there is proportionate common law representation among any additional judges; that the costs of additional judges are covered within existing budgets; and that the selection method provides the Court with the stability it requires to function effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="european-semester-and-the-annual-growth-survey"&gt;European Semester and the Annual Growth Survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission will present key elements of the 2013 annual growth survey which can be found on the Commission’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual growth survey sets out the Commission’s views on the economic priorities for Europe for 2013, focusing on fiscal consolidation, promoting economic growth and employment. The survey, which represents the first stage of the 2013 European Semester, focuses on growth-friendly fiscal consolidation measures across the EU.  The European Semester is the EU-wide framework for coordinating structural reforms and growth-enhancing policies. We do not expect this item to be opened for substantive discussion but, in the event that it is, I will be supporting the focus on growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="preparation-for-the-december-european-council"&gt;Preparation for the December European Council&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agenda for the December European Council will cover: economic policy, including Economic and Monetary Union and Banking Union; defence; enlargement; and foreign policy. The last two items are covered by the separate sections of this Written Ministerial Statement on enlargement and on the Foreign Affairs Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the European Council meeting will focus on agreeing a legislative framework for Banking Union and an agenda for further Economic and Monetary integration in the Eurozone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the December European Council the Prime Minister will seek to ensure the integrity of the Single Market at 27, including in the context of the Banking Union and the European Banking Authority. We will also press for further progress on growth and ensure that the timetable for further integration in the Eurozone progresses at the right pace and in the right way.  I will argue that these concerns should be addressed prior to the December European Council so that solutions to these issues can be put to leaders on 13 and 14 December.
The December European Council agenda item on defence will pave the way for further discussion in 2013.  I will argue for a focus on developing capabilities, enhancing operational effectiveness and strengthening the European defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-18-month-programme-for-the-presidencies-of-ireland-lithuania-and-greece"&gt;The 18-month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAC has been asked to endorse the 18-month programme of the Council. This sets out the combined programme for the Irish, Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies of the European Council covering the period January 2013 to June 2014. I expect the programme to be published shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="enlargement"&gt;Enlargement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will seek to agree conclusions taking stock of progress on EU enlargement, and on the stabilisation and association process in the Western Balkans. The Commission released their Annual Enlargement Package on 10 October.  In this communication, the Commission recommended: (i) opening accession negotiations with Macedonia; and (ii) granting Albania candidate status subject to the completion of three specific measures and evidence of continued commitment in the fight against organised crime and corruption. We believe the communication to be a broadly fair and balanced assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will seek conclusions reconfirming the European Council’s support for EU enlargement and recognising that the accession process gives strong encouragement to political and economic reform and reinforces peace, democracy and stability. We agree with the Commission’s view that closer relations with the EU should be based on the principles of delivery on commitments, fair and rigorous conditionality, and good communication with the public. We agree that key challenges remain for most enlargement countries, including in the area of the rule of law. We also support a focus on freedom of expression and regional co-operation, particularly for the Western Balkans countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out the Government’s views on the Commission’s reports in my explanatory memorandum of 18 October. We will seek Council conclusions welcoming Croatia’s continued progress towards meeting all of its commitments in full before its expected accession on 1 July 2013, while reiterating the Commission’s call for Croatia to sharpen its focus to ensure this is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will seek conclusions that provide a fair and balanced assessment of Turkey’s progress, which will inject much needed momentum into the process to allow accession negotiations to move forward in 2013. I will argue that Iceland should be commended on the progress made in accession negotiations this year, while recalling the need for Iceland to address existing obligations, such as those identified by the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority under the European Economic Area Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also expect the Council to welcome the opening of accession negotiations with Montenegro in June 2012, while calling for early progress in the area of the rule of law, in line with the new approach to accession negotiations endorsed by the Council in December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the FAC discussion of 10 December, the GAC will discuss the Commission’s enlargement package for the Western Balkans countries. We remain fully supportive of a future for all of the Western Balkans countries in the EU, once conditions are met. We want the European Council to commend good progress on reform in Macedonia through the High Level Accession Dialogue, and hope the European Council will be able to build on this by agreeing to the Commission’s fourth successive recommendation to open accession negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a further report from the Commission, the December European Council will not be in a position to grant candidate status to Albania; we will want it to call on Albania to make early progress on reform implementation and establish a track record on tackling organised crime and corruption to enable a decision in 2013. I will argue for Council conclusions that underline that Serbia still needs to make real progress to deliver a “visible and sustainable improvement” in its relations with Pristina before accession negotiations can be opened, while noting that this remains in reach if recent progress continues.  We want the Council to welcome the Commission’s assessment that a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo is feasible and to signal that negotiations should begin as soon as possible.  We agree with the Commission’s assessment that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress on its EU agenda has stalled. We will want the Council to press the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to make progress and deliver quickly on those issues they themselves have agreed to, for example, on the EU road map agreed in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Written Ministerial Statement on Foreign Office public records</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 5 December 2011, I informed the House of our plans to make a large collection of colonial administration files available to the public over a 2 year period (Official Record column 6WS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have today made the fourth tranche of files available for the public to view at The National Archives (TNA) at Kew. This marks the half way point. I am pleased to confirm that we remain on track to complete the transfer of the entire collection of files to TNA by the end of 2013 as per the schedule published on the FCO website. As promised, we have kept redactions to an absolute minimum. I am very grateful to the Independent Reviewer, Professor Anthony Badger, for overseeing this work with such care and commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains the case that the FCO is still unable to confirm the existence or destruction of 170 boxes of Top Secret colonial administration files known to have been returned to the UK. There is some evidence that the Singapore Top Secret colonial administration files were destroyed as part of a review of FCO post files in the 1990s. The FCO continues to search for these files or for further evidence of their destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work on the colonial files has, regrettably, caused a short-term backlog in the regular annual transfer of some FCO departmental files from 1981 and 1982. Additional staff resource has been allocated to tackle this. We will publish on the FCO website a timetable to transfer the remaining 1981 and 1982 files between 2013 and 2015.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his statement to the House on 5 May 2011 (Official Report, column 24WS), my Right Honourable Friend the Foreign Secretary undertook to implement in full the recommendations of the Cary review into the colonial administration files.  These included an up to date inventory of the FCO’s archival holdings. This has brought to light a large accumulation of other material outside the FCO departmental file series, much of which is over 30 years old and therefore overdue for review.  The FCO has not identified any colonial administration files amongst these papers beyond those currently being transferred. In keeping with this Government’s commitment to transparency, we will be publishing a copy of the high level inventory of these “Special Collections” on the FCO website. We remain fully committed both to complying with our public records obligations and to doing so with maximum transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Kosovo offered membership to European Bank of Reconstruction and Development</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister for Europe, David Lidington, has welcomed the decision on 16 November by the Governors of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to offer membership to the Republic of Kosovo.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Lidington said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome yesterday’s decision by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to offer membership to the Republic of Kosovo. EBRD membership will help Kosovo in its efforts to achieve greater socio-economic development, prosperity and stability for all its citizens.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is the latest example of Kosovo’s progress towards becoming fully integrated into the international community. The UK will remain strong supporters of Kosovo’s efforts towards this goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Written Ministerial Statement on the Foreign Affairs Council</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs will attend the Foreign Affairs Council on the afternoon of 19 November. My Right Honourable Friend the Minister for International Security Strategy will attend the European Defence Agency Steering Board and the Defence Foreign Affairs Council on the morning of 19 November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a joint lunch for Foreign and Defence Ministers to consider the issues outlined below. These meetings will be held in Brussels and will be chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton of Upholland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will attend the General Affairs Council on 20 November, and the preceding dinner with President Van Rompuy on 19 November. The meeting will be chaired by the Cypriot Presidency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the EDA Steering Board, Ministers will be expected to agree as usual the EDA’s budget and work programme for the forthcoming year and its indicative work plan for the next 3 years.  Also on the agenda are the EDA’s approach to pooling and sharing and the defence contribution to the development of EU policies. The Pooling and Sharing Report gives a progress update of ongoing activity such as the Helicopter Training Programme and Maritime Surveillance Networking, proposes new opportunities for pooling and sharing, and includes the Code of Conduct for Pooling and Sharing which Ministers are expected to adopt. Ministers will be updated on EDA work on the interaction between defence and wider EU policies such as Industry and Market, Research and Innovation and European Space Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defence Foreign Affairs Council&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agenda is expected to focus on EU Operations and the Defence Task Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Operations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session on EU operations should open with an update on the current state of play in each of the EU’s CSDP (Common Security and Defence Policy) operations. It is anticipated that discussion could then focus on the future of the EU Training Mission in Somalia. The UK is supportive of a third mandate for EUTM Somalia, so we will look to push for extension of the mandate and to set out our thinking on the design of that mandate. The Mali operation is the subject of a specific discussion during the joint lunch, so we do not expect it to be discussed during this session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Task Force&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will receive an update from the European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services on the EU Defence Task Force’s efforts in supporting competitiveness, and on innovation of the European defence industry within the internal market. The Defence Task Force is an internal EU Commission body co-chaired by the Commission’s DG Market and DG Enterprise, established in 2011 to identify measures to improve the internal defence market and improve the European defence industrial base.  It is focused on the three main areas of the internal market, the Commission’s Defence Industry Policy and defence research and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defence and Foreign Ministers Lunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mali   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over an informal lunch, Ministers will discuss the draft Crisis Management Concept being drawn up as part of the planning process for a CSDP mission to Mali. We do not expect Conclusions to be issued from the lunch. This is an opportunity for the UK to express its support for accelerated planning towards a CSDP mission while ensuring that due rigour is applied to that planning process.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2013 European Council on Defence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will have an orientation debate on CSDP ahead of the 2013 European Council on defence. The December 2012 European Council will commission the relevant EU institutions to conduct preparatory work through the course of 2013. The discussion at the FAC will centre on this tasking. We welcome the European Council looking at this issue and will be pushing for a tasking framed around enhancing European military effectiveness and a more efficient European defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Affairs Council&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southern Neighbourhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will review developments in Syria, Lebanon, Libya, and Egypt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers are likely to discuss recent events in Syria and their impact on EU efforts to support a peaceful transition. The UK is pushing for agreement to the full renewal of the EU’s restrictive measures on Syria which come up for renewal on 1 December, and will encourage other Member States to increase their humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Lebanon, following the bomb attack in Beirut on 19 October, we expect Conclusions which will condemn that attack and reiterate the EU’s strong commitment to Lebanon’s stability and independence. The Conclusions will reiterate the EU’s support for the work of the Lebanese Armed Forces and urge all Lebanese parties to engage in the dialogue being led by President Sleiman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers may take stock of recent events in Libya, including the appointment of Prime Minister-elect Ali Zidan and progress in the approval of his government. There will be an opportunity to discuss the provision and coordination of international assistance to the new Libyan authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Egypt, the Council will discuss follow-up to the EU-Egypt Task Force in Cairo which takes place on 13-14 November. The Task Force is a key moment in resetting the EU’s relationship with Egypt. We will continue to encourage greater emphasis on the principles of more-for-more in the follow-up to it, in line with EU ambition to use the ENP to incentivise reform. The Task Force will also discuss work, including in the UK, to improve repatriation of assets stolen from transition countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yemen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is almost one year since the transition process in Yemen began with the signing of the Gulf Co-operation Council Initiative on 23 November 2011. The transition remains broadly on track, with President Hadi successfully appointed after an interim election in February, and the formation of a national unity government. The proposed Conclusions would show our support for these efforts but also encourage the Yemenis to continue in this vein through the successful preparation and launch of an inclusive National Dialogue, and preparations for full national elections in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle East Peace Process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle East Peace Process discussions will focus on the prospect of a Palestinian application to the UN General Assembly to upgrade their status to that of a non-member observer state. The UK will emphasise the need for EU countries to vote in a manner which advances our shared goal of realising the two state solution. We will make clear that we are encouraging the new US administration to act quickly to put its full weight behind ensuring the Israelis and Palestinians return to substantive negotiations resulting in the resolution of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be an in-depth discussion of Ukraine following the parliamentary elections on 28 October. The discussion will consider how to take forward the EU-Ukraine relationship in the light of the elections and other developments.  We do not expect there to be Conclusions in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers are expected to agree Conclusions which will highlight our concerns about the insecurity in eastern DRC; condemn the actions of M23 and other armed groups; call for the cessation of all outside support for M23; and underline the importance of the government of the DRC showing leadership in resolving the problems. Ministers will also have the opportunity to consider what steps should be taken next to help to resolve the situation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuba&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will discuss the current situation in Cuba and the future of EU-Cuba relations. EU-Cuba relations are currently governed by the 1996 Common Position, which can be &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996E0697:EN:NOT"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU-US&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will have the opportunity to discuss the EU’s priorities with the US following the US presidential elections on 6 November and the re-election of President Obama. We expect the discussion to cover a spectrum of leading international issues, including the global economy. We will stress the importance of an EU-US trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Affairs Council&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key item of discussion will be the preparation for the November European Council on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The General Affairs Council (GAC) has led on the preparation of the MFF, which has been discussed at every GAC over the past year. Key issues such as the overall size of the MFF 2014-20 and the composition of spend in the different headings will be taken forward to the November European Council.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the MFF we expect this GAC to discuss the Commission’s work programme for 2013, follow up on the agreements reached at the October European Council and the agenda for the December European Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiannual Financial Framework&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will focus initially on issues around Cohesion policy, on which the Presidency hopes to secure a partial general approach on two remaining negotiating blocks: financial management, and the common strategic framework. Financial management deals with the processes for examination and acceptance of accounts and for financial corrections. The Common Strategic Framework is an annex to the Common Provisions Regulation which provides a strategic orientation at EU level for the funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main item will be preparation for the special November European Council on 22 and 23 November. This will be discussed at a dinner with President Van Rompuy on 19 November and again during the Tuesday 20 November session.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot Presidency has produced various iterations of the ‘negotiating box’ which now has an upper ceiling of numbers for the MFF. The Presidency has made it clear that they expect further downward revisions and I will be arguing that the upper ceiling is far too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect a further version of the negotiating box to be issued before the GAC. This will be &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/special-reports/mff/negotiating-box"&gt;available here.&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be emphasising the strength of feeling on budget size in the UK as demonstrated by the recent vote in the House of Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also emphasise again that we will not agree to any changes to Own Resources, including the UK abatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow up to the October European Council and agenda for December European Council&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the October European Council the Commission was urged to make progress on implementation of the Growth Compact and to speed up delivery on growth enhancing measures such as concluding trade agreements. The Commission have indicated that they will undertake to put proposals on a range of issues on the table before the end of the year. I will urge the Commission to press forward on the issues we consider priorities, including the annual growth survey and the internal energy market, but also to maintain momentum in other areas such as the trade agenda, where the need for progress was highlighted in particular in the October European Council. I will emphasise the need for progress on trade deals with Singapore, Japan, Canada and also the United States, which the Prime Minister discussed with President Obama when they spoke after his re-election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister for Europe David Lidington visits Sweden</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden is a key strategic partner for the UK; we share common goals, views and values across a broad spectrum, from Europe to trade to defence.  Sweden shares UK interests over single market, financial services, Eurozone ins and outs, enlargement and global free trade, as well as reform of the EU.  UK and Sweden are also close economic and trading partners - in 2011 Sweden was UK’s 10 largest export market and the UK was Sweden’s 3rd largest export market.  Given the breadth of the overlap, the Minister had much to talk about with his Swedish partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister Lidington discussed UK-Sweden co-operation on key EU issues, including Eurozone, Banking Union, Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and Future of Europe with EU Minister Birgitta Ohlsson.  In his meeting with Foreign Minister Carl Bildt he discussed foreign policy issues, including Iran, Syria and Russia, as well as the EU’s Eastern partnership, particularly Ukraine and Belarus, and EU enlargement with focus on Western Balkans and Turkey.  Focus for the Minister’s meeting with State Secretaries from the Prime Minister’s Office and the Finance Ministry was key EU economic/financial issues, such as Eurozone, Banking Union and MFF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister also spoke at UI/The Swedish Institute of International Affairs on the future of Europe and how the EU can develop politically, economically and institutionally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Membership of the euro is not an essential part of what it means to be an EU member.  We want a Europe that respects its diversity; members that want to integrate on different subjects.  We need arrangements that ensure EU institutions are accountable to and work for all member states, not just a subset of member states.  There is now a sub-debate on what architecture is right for a more diverse EU.  We need to make it possible for the EU to develop in a way that recognises member state diversity.  For that we do not need to change treaties but apply subsidiarity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is in UK’s interest to be an active member of the EU, for example for the single market, the single voice in trade and foreign policy co-operation.  How effective member states such as the UK and Sweden can be outside the Eurozone, depends in part on culture and in part on rules in the EU, and the treaties.  We must safeguard the single market of the 27 in the treaties.  There are many like-minded groups on issues that do not follow this divide, e.g. on the single market or on trade.  All member states must be treated on an equal basis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before returning to London Minister Lidington met the visiting Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and EU Minister from Kosovo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister for Europe visits Yerevan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The UK highly values its relationship with Armenia as we mark twenty years of our relations”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the meeting with the President both sides stressed importance of Armenian-UK bilateral relations. Serzh Sargsyan expressed his hope that the visit of Mr. Lidington would become an impetus for the strengthening of the relations and deepening of cooperation between two countries. He highlighted the importance of cooperation between Armenia and Great Britain in the framework of relations with the European Union. Mr. Lidington mentioned that the UK is deeply grateful for the contribution that Armenia continues to make to the peace-keeping forces in Afghanistan and was impressed by the progress Armenia had made in developing closer ties with the EU and NATO.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Receiving David Lidington in Armenian Government building the Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan stressed that the level of the Armenian-British economic cooperation is increasing and in this context. He also briefed the Minister on the reforms taking place in Armenia, directed at the development of small and medium businesses, reduction of tax and customs administration and creation of free economic zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Office Minister said that he is very pleased to see a whole range of British brands in Yerevan and stressed the importance of strengthening commercial ties between UK and Armenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Ministry of Foreign affairs Armenian Minister Edward Nalbandian and Mr. Lidington discussed ways of further deepen cooperation in political, scientific, educational, cultural and other spheres. Minister Nalbandian said, “This year we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Armenia and the United Kingdom and we can state that the cooperation between the sides is on a sustainable basis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response the Minister said “United Kingdom considers Armenia as a long-term and valuable partner and his visit is aimed at the provision of a new impetus to the cooperation with Armenia”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Nalbandyan presented the current stage of the negotiations over the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. He touched upon the damage to regional stability and security caused by the release of Ramil Safarov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister for Europe responded that the United Kingdom fully supports the OSCE Minsk Group processes. He mentioned that the UK shares the provisions in the statements of the European Union, Council of Europe and OSCE Minsk Group over the release of Ramil Safarov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his two day visit he met with leading businessmen to better understand the economic opportunities presented by Armenia for both trade and investment. He also discussed increasing awareness of the human rights situation in Armenia and exchanged views on regional and international issues with well-known Armenian analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the reception organised by the Armenian British Business Chamber the Minister stressed that he wants to look at how to build further economic and commercial relations between the UK and Armenia and that now the British Government is working on bringing out a business mission to Yerevan in November.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overseas Territories flags flown over Foreign Office</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From now on, the flag of each UK Overseas Territory will be flown over the FCO one day every year, to mark a significant day in each of their respective histories.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Lidington said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I send my greetings and best wishes to all Gibraltarians on Gibraltar National Day. It is a day to celebrate the people of Gibraltar, their community and identity. It is fitting that Gibraltar’s flag should be flown annually in London to mark this occasion.”      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Simmonds said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am pleased that the FCO is celebrating this new era of positive engagement between the UK and the Territories by flying their flags over our building in London. The Government is determined to show our commitment to this relationship in a year which has seen a number of important landmarks, including the publication of the White Paper.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 14 June, the flag of the Falkland Islands was flown over the FCO, 10 Downing Street and the Department for Communities and Local Government to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the islands’ liberation. The flags of all Territories were flown as part of the Diamond Jubilee pageant and will be featured in future ceremonies of State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Office Minister disappointed by verdict on Tymoshenko appeal</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am disappointed to hear that Yuliya Tymoshenko’s final domestic appeal against her October 2011 conviction has been turned down by the Higher Specialized Court of Ukraine for Civil and Criminal Cases.  We have consistently drawn attention to independent expert concerns about the conduct of Ms Tymoshenko’s trial, and that of other opposition figures.  The UK will continue to press Ukraine to end selective justice and to ensure that the opposition is able to participate fully in free and fair parliamentary elections in October. Progress on Ukraine’s Association Agreement with the EU will remain difficult without clear evidence that Ukraine is embracing democracy and the rule of law.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Report of the Human Rights Council on Syria</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest report of the Human Rights Council mandated Commission of Inquiry into human rights violations in Syria was published today.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister, David Lidington, said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The evidence of human rights violations and abuses perpetrated by all parties, documented in the latest UN Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry report, is a chilling reminder of how far the situation in Syria has deteriorated over the last six months.  I am particularly disturbed by the reports of human rights violations and abuses committed against children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The report is clear that the gravity, frequency and scale of human rights violations perpetrated by the Syrian Government and its Shabbiha militia far exceeds abuses committed by anti-government armed groups.  The Syrian government has not simply failed in its responsibility to protect its citizens, but continues to repress them on a daily basis. The report lays the blame squarely at the regime’s door for the horrific massacre in Al-Houlah, confirming the earlier findings of UNSMIS and British-trained human rights activists.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The wide ranging information collected by the Commission of Inquiry, including details of individuals believed to be responsible for these crimes, will make a significant contribution towards efforts on accountability. I commend its work in gathering more than 1,000 witness statements since September 2011, as well as examining significant amounts of disturbing material such as photographs, videos and medical records.  As an independent body, its work is invaluable and we call for an extension of its mandate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
