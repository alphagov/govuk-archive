    <title>Government accepts proposals to improve garage standards</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorists are being encouraged to find out if their garage is approved by a set of industry-standard codes to make sure they are getting value for money.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call comes after the government accepted a number of proposals made by industry experts to help drive up standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Motorists’ Forum has set out a raft of recommendations aimed at making sure motorists have the best possible consumer experience when having their vehicles serviced or repaired in a report released today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will promote the wider adoption of self-regulation (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;-&lt;abbr title="Trading Standards Institute"&gt;TSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) codes of practice by garages and encourage greater publication of information regarding services they offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an AA survey*, 78% of people always use the same garage meaning that only a minority of motorists shop around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the work carried out by the Motorists’ Forum and believe the recommendations will help build on existing best practice in the industry without the burden of extra legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important that consumers feel confident in the quality and the value for money of the services they are receiving from garages. The Forum’s report has offered some useful proposals for how this can be achieved more consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would urge motorists to find out if their local garage has been approved by the codes to ensure they are getting a fair service and value for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will now use their strong relationships with the industry and stakeholders to promote the adopted recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK car service and repair sector is worth around £6.9 billion per year to the GB economy with 150,000 MOT tests taking place every working day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Motorists’ Forum report on garage customer experience can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-report-of-the-motorists-forum-sub-group-on-improving-customer-service-experience-at-garages"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s response can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-motorists-forum-report-on-garage-customer-experience"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Motorists’ Forum is made up of a group of experts convened by the DfT. Organisations include the AA, RAC, &lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, Centre for Automotive Management, &lt;abbr title="compulsory basic training"&gt;CBT&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Transport for London"&gt;TfL&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Association Of British Insurers"&gt;ABI&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Freight Transport Association"&gt;FTA&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association"&gt;BVRLA&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety"&gt;PACTS&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders"&gt;SMMT&lt;/abbr&gt; as well as representatives from the DfT and Highways Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Trading Standards Institute (&lt;abbr title="Trading Standards Institute"&gt;TSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) will be taking over responsibility for the consumer codes approval scheme from the Office of Fair Trading (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;). The new scheme will maintain the rigour of the current scheme, but will streamline the approval process and make it self-funding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responsibility for vehicle roadworthiness and testing lies with DfT and &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; administers the MOT scheme. Responsibility for consumer protection legislation lies with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is already considerable consumer protection legislation in place to cover the practices of garages which choose to trade unfairly or who are not competent to trade; both from the perspective of individual consumer rights through sale of goods and services legislation, and through the application of criminal sanctions, principally via the Consumer Protection from unfair trading regulations&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Improving motoring services</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Road users, businesses and other stakeholders were today invited to suggest improvements to the way motoring services such as driving tests and vehicle licensing are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is putting customers firmly at the heart of the way motoring services are delivered so that they best serve the consumer while getting the best possible deal for the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the Department for Transport is outlining broad reform proposals for the 4 motoring services agencies: Driving Standards Agency (DSA); Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA); Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) and the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roads Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you drive, run a business or pay taxes you will be a customer of ours and I hope you will have your say about how we can improve the services we offer you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much progress has already been achieved and it is now much easier to use digital services to get driving licences, and sort out vehicle tax. We have also already announced that we are bringing the driving test closer to customers by exploring a range of different locations, such as colleges and retail premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But there is more that can be done and this consultation is about the government listening to its customers before agreeing the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department’s 4 agencies are already engaged in programmes of reform to deliver long term financial stability and efficiency, and better services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation sets out a longer term view of the future of these reforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Position the agencies at the forefront of digital services, ensuring that those who find access to digital services difficult are supported to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support economic growth and vehicle manufacturing by reforming the Vehicle Certification Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring the driving test closer to the customer by exploring opportunities to improve convenience to customers. This includes assessing options for the delivery of the practical test. We are keen to explore all options that maintain the integrity of the test and high quality standards whoever is the provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transform &lt;abbr title="heaviy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt;, bus and coach testing by expanding joint ventures and collaboration with private sector providers, and reducing the number of government owned test stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliver better customer services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider rationalising the number of bodies and agencies involved in delivering services - delivering services as simply as possible, increasing flexibility and innovation, improving efficiency and reducing costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 7 March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation is the department’s response to the government’s broader vision for public services as set out in the civil service reform plan, the Open Public Services white paper and the government digital strategy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The consultation document can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/motoring-services-strategy"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Consultation on Motoring Services Strategy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today announcing the publication of a &lt;a href="/government/consultations/motoring-services-strategy"&gt;consultation document on the Department for Transport’s Motoring Services Strategy&lt;/a&gt;. In line with the government’s broader vision for public services as set out in the Civil Service Reform Plan, the Open Public Services White Paper and the Government Digital Strategy, the department is outlining broad reform proposals for its four motoring services executive agencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driving Standards Agency (DSA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Strategy sets out three principles for the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;putting consumers and businesses at the heart of what we do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalising the number of bodies and agencies involved in the delivery of our services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working more closely and collaboratively with our partners to deliver services, and boost economic growth by creating opportunities for small and medium size businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this we will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maximise the digital delivery of services to motorists and improve the customer experience. We will also ensure that those who find access to digital services difficult are supported to do so&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reform the Vehicle Certification Agency(VCA) which provides high quality and trusted service to the automotive industry and is recognised for its quality and integrity.  We will look at ways to help VCA to grow and contribute more to the wider economy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explore ways to improve the convenience to customers of the driving test by looking at the locations from which we deliver them &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;transform &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt;, bus and coach testing by expanding joint ventures and collaboration with private sector providers, and reducing the number of government owned test stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalise the number of agencies and reconfigure our organisations to reduce cost and improve consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are inviting views and responses from as broad a range of organisations and users of our services as possible This will include road users, businesses, trade associations, road safety groups, transport associations and others. Improving the way we engage with and listen to them will help to design better services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 7 March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Garage customer experience</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today publishing the &lt;a href="/government/publications/government-response-to-motorists-forum-report-on-garage-customer-experience"&gt;government’s response to the Motorists’ Forum sub-group report recommendations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Motorists’ Forum has set out a raft of recommendations aimed at making sure motorists have the best possible consumer experience when having their vehicles serviced or repaired in the report released today. The Department for Transport (DfT) and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) have worked closely together to produce the government response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car service and repair sector is worth around £6.9 billion per year to the GB economy with 150,000 MOT tests taking place every working day.  The garage industry is important both to transport policy (especially road safety) and as part of a wider landscape of consumer affairs.  It is important that consumers feel confident in the quality and the value for money of the services they are receiving from garages.  The Motorists’ Forum’s report has offered some useful proposals for how this can be achieved more consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome the work carried out by the Motorists’ Forum and believe the recommendations we plan to adopt will help build on existing best practice in the industry and encourage garages to improve customer services, without the burden of extra legislation.  The recommendations we will be adopting will promote the wider adoption of self-regulation (OFT-TSI) codes of practice by garages and encourage greater publication of information regarding the services they offer.  As of November this year we have already introduced the requirement to have vehicle mileages printed on MOT certificates to help combat ‘clocking’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DfT and BIS will now use their strong relationships with the garage industry and stakeholders to promote the adopted recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Road safety</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to update the House on the launch of the government’s latest Think! Road Safety campaign, targeted at drink driving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action by successive governments over the last 30 years has meant that the number of people killed in drink drive accidents has been reduced by over three-quarters since 1979.  But drink driving remains a problem, 280 people lost their lives in 2011 in drink drive accidents on Britain’s roads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in partnership with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.acpo.police.uk/"&gt;Association of Chief Police Officers (&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, so that people see education and enforcement working together, the government has just relaunched its successful Think! campaign aimed at reminding drivers – particularly young drivers, who are over-represented in the casualty figures – of the risks of getting behind the wheel after consuming alcohol: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://think.direct.gov.uk/"&gt;http://think.direct.gov.uk/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt; enforcement anti-drink and drug driving enforcement campaign seeks particularly to focus on well-intentioned drivers who do not think they are breaking the law but may be over the legal limit by the time they get into their cars in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, at the end of last week I launched a further round of the very successful &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/campaign-to-reward-designated-drivers-launched-by-coca-cola-great-britain-and-think"&gt;designated driver campaign, in partnership with Coca-Cola&lt;/a&gt;. Now in its 5th year, the nationwide campaign offers designated drivers a ‘buy one get one free’ deal on Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero at participating pubs.  The campaign began last Thursday and will run until the end of December. Further details are available at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/designated-driver/"&gt;http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/designated-driver/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Campaign to reward designated drivers launched by Coca-Cola Great Britain and THINK!</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designated drivers will be rewarded with a ‘buy one get one free’ deal on Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero, this Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the winter period designated drivers across the UK will give lifts to friends and family as they enjoy a festive night out at pubs and bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Great Britain and the Road Safety Minister, Stephen Hammond MP, will today celebrate and pledge to reward responsible drivers, at the launch of this year’s designated driver campaign at the Mason Arms pub in Central London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in its 5th year the nationwide designated driver campaign will reward drivers who choose not to drink alcohol with a ‘buy one, get one free’ offer on Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and CokeZero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme will run for 3 weeks from 6 to 31 December and is part of an ongoing partnership with the THINK! driver friendly campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dedicated website has also been set up to encourage consumers to take advantage of the offer. From the 6 December designated drivers and their friends can visit &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/designated-driver/"&gt;the Coca-Cola website&lt;/a&gt; to find a participating pub in their area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hammond, Road Safety Minister, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our THINK! campaign makes it clear that drink drivers risk losing their licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am pleased that THINK! will be teaming up with Coca-Cola and pub chains across the country to reward designated drivers as well as reminding people of the consequences of getting a drink drive conviction. No one wants to spend their Christmas in a police cell.  My message is clear: don’t drink and drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon Woods, General Manager, Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Designated drivers provide an amazing service to friends and family. They allow people to have a good night and also help keep roads safe, so everyone can enjoy the Christmas period. By rewarding drivers who choose not to drink with a free Coke, Diet Coke or Coke Zero, we hope even more people will be encouraged to do the right thing and become responsible drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kieron Murphy, Licensee, Masons Arms: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We see a lot of people come in over the Christmas period who are responsible for driving their friends and family home at the end of the night. That’s why we are delighted to be participating in Coca-Cola’s designated driver campaign this year.  It will reward our regulars and make sure they still have a good night out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch event will take place on 6 December (7.30-9am) at the Mason Arms, Maddox Street, London. The designated driver campaign forms part of Coca-Cola Great Britain’s pledge to promote the positive role in which soft drinks can play as credible alternatives to alcohol. The designated driver campaign is a key feature of Coca-Cola Great Britain’s overall commitment to responsible marketing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="about-the-research"&gt;About the research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research was conducted by Populus for Coca-Cola in November 2011 with 2000 adults. Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;79% of women have used a designated driver at the end of a night out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;men are more likely to abstain from alcohol with 63% having given it up to drive friends/family home before &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;62% of adults plan to go to a pub or bar over the Christmas and New Year period&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two thirds of those aged 65+ have been a designated driver compared to just over half of 18 to 24 year olds &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;however 18 to 24 year olds will give the most lifts over the Christmas and New Year period, on average taking 5 people &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the majority of those polled never drive home after drinking more than one alcoholic drink on a night out (83%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nearly half of respondents thought that the best thing about designated drivers is that they stop people drink driving, while 3 in 4 believe it is because they ensure people can get home safely at the end of a night out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="about-coca-cola-great-britain"&gt;About Coca-Cola Great Britain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Great Britain is responsible for marketing 21 brands and over 100 products to consumers across Great Britain, focusing upon developing new brands, extending existing brands and protecting trademarks including Coca-Cola (recognised as the world’s most valuable brand). Other Coca-Cola Great Britain brands include Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Fanta, Sprite, Dr Pepper, Oasis, Glaceauvitaminwater, Schweppes, 5 Alive, Lilt, Kia Ora, Relentless Energy Drink and Powerade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola Great Britain portfolio is worth £1,998 million with value sales growth of 8.4% year on year.  Within this the My Coke trilogy (Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coke Zero) is worth £1,150 million, growing at 6.4% in value year on year (Neilsen, w/c 11/02/12).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Great Britain is committed to developing innovative, responsible and sustainable initiatives that help protect the environment.  Recently the company launched its PlantBottle™ plastic made from up to 22.5% plant-based materials and up to 25% recycled plastic as the latest step on its journey towards petroleum-free plastic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is also dedicated to recycling, with 97% of site waste recycled or recovered. For more information about Coca-Cola in Great Britain, please visit the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.coca-cola.co.uk"&gt;Coca-Cola website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="about-the-think-drink-drive-campaign-and-driver-friendly-initiative"&gt;About the THINK! drink drive campaign and driver friendly initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of people killed in drink drive accidents has been reduced by over three-quarters since 1979 thanks to more than 30 years of government education campaigns and measures to improve enforcement. However, drink driving is still a problem and provisional statistics show that 280 people lost their lives in drink drive accidents on Britain’s road in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The THINK! campaign has had a long-standing and well supported partnership with the on-trade and soft drinks industry. In December 2009, this was developed into the ‘driver friendly’ campaign which aims to support the designated driver through the provision of promotional offers and ‘rewards’, linked to the purchase of soft drinks, on their night out. Coca-Cola GB is leading the way for Christmas 2012, and their designated driver promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Institute of Advanced Motorists </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank-you for that introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank-you also for asking me along - it’s an absolute pleasure to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="not-complacent"&gt;Not complacent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I took up my post I inherited a road safety record second to none. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This country is a genuine world leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean for a single minute that it’s ‘job done’ or ‘mission accomplished’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, the provisional figures for the year ending June 2012 show a reduction in fatalities compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, it is very welcome news that, for all road users, the numbers killed and seriously injured are down 17% compared with the 2005-2009 average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s also worth remembering that, while the 2011 figures were slightly up on 2010, the 2010 figures were exceptionally low, and that 2011 was still lower than 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in spite of all we have achieved, we should never forget that road deaths are not statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are someone’s mother or father, brother or sister, son or daughter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are real lives cut short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as Simon (Simon Best – &lt;abbr title="Institute of Advanced Motorists"&gt;IAM&lt;/abbr&gt;) reminded us, road accidents also hit the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers and the graphs may change from year to year, but one thing stays constant - accidents carry a heavy human cost and a huge economic price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why this government is not complacent on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we will continue to do all we can to make our roads safer in our ambition to be the safest we can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in the short time I have today I don’t want to talk you through every last dot and comma of the government’s road safety agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I would like to do is give you an insight into my thinking around some of the key priority areas as I see them - a brief but broad overview if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="localism"&gt;Localism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let me touch on an issue Simon mentioned in his speech - the important road safety role of local authorities, especially in terms of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are testing economic times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I recognise that local government, just like central government, faces tough spending choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also know that it is local communities, rather than Whitehall bureaucrats, who are best placed to design local road safety solutions to meet local road safety challenges&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that includes deciding where to focus their resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what localism is all about - the power to choose for yourself, backed by the funding to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are giving more than £1 billion to local councils enabling them to improve the transport infrastructure – including the design of better and safer roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re investing £600 million in local transport through the Local Sustainable Transport Fund – which again gives authorities greater power to deliver their own transport projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Transport for Manchester secured £32.5 million from the Fund for their ‘Let’s get to work project’ - a project designed to give people the kind of viable travel options that allow them to make their journey to work in way that is healthier and safer, cleaner and greener, whether it’s walking, cycling or hopping on the local bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the &lt;abbr title="Local Sustainable Transport Fund"&gt;LSTF&lt;/abbr&gt; projects contain a cycling element – not just providing better routes, but also making roads safer for cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take the issue of cycle safety very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial at a time when thousands of people are taking up bike riding - inspired by the heroics of our Tour de France, Olympic and Paralympic cyclists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the department has recently launched a THINK! cycle safety campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve made £30 million available to tackle dangerous junctions for cyclists across the country&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have made it simpler for councils to put in place 20mph zones - and install Trixi mirrors to improve the visibility of cyclists at junctions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycle safety is about embracing technology and changing behaviour. So we will continue to develop new ideas and initiatives to build on the progress we’ve already made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="drug-driving"&gt;Drug driving&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d argue that one of the great successes of road safety over the last 40 years has been the extent to which drink driving has become socially unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the number of drink drive deaths has fallen by more than 75% since 1979. The culture has completely changed from social necessity to social pariah, such is the view of today’s drink drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sadly, people are still losing their lives because of drink drive collisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;280 were killed last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, through our award winning THINK Campaign, we continue to push home the message that people who drive while over the limit risk losing their licence, being fined or even going to prison. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, they have to be aware that they could injure, or worse kill someone – including someone they love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve also just launched a drink-drive consultation which includes proposals to close down the legal loopholes where some drivers try to avoid prosecution by demanding to replace their breath test with blood or urine tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink driving kills. Fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in my view, it is just as socially unacceptable and dangerous to drive while impaired by drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we tackled drink driving in the 1980s, now in the 2010s, it’s time to defeat drug driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I believe we have to make sure that drug drivers face the full force of the law, just like drink drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the government is taking three major steps to do just that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;type approval will shortly be given to drug testing devices for police stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we expect to introduce road-side drug screeners during 2014&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and the new law to prosecute drug-drivers will also come into come into effect by the summer of 2014 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This government is on the side of the motoring majority who abide by the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to the reckless minority of drivers who think they can take drugs, jump behind the wheel and get away with it, my message is clear and it’s simple - you will be caught and you will be punished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-hard-core-few-and-the-law-abiding-many"&gt;The hard core few and the law abiding many&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now say a few words about the hard core few and the law abiding many. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re targeting enforcement efforts against the dangerous behaviour of the hardcore few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drivers who commit serious, deliberate and repeated offences - the ones with a poor attitude rather than poor skills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told you about cracking down on drink drivers. But there’s no hiding place for the uninsured either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, for example, we’re making full use of existing powers to seize an offender’s vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police seized around 140,000 vehicles for this offence last year, and the level of uninsured driving has decreased from around 2 million drivers in 2005 to 1.2 million drivers in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also introduced the continuous insurance enforcement scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insurance industry estimate that, with the introduction of this scheme - assuming that police enforcement continues at its current rate - the level of uninsured driving could be reduced by up to 40% in the next 5 years&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the law abiding many that’s good news, both for road safety and, I hope, for future insurance premiums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I believe it’s absolutely vital to support the law abiding many.
The motorists who want to do the right thing and who just need a nudge in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, that means offering more educational options to drivers who make genuine mistakes, display poor skills or commit occasional low level offences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means improving training and testing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the reason we’ve made changes to the practical portion of the driving test so that, instead of being taught how to pass a test, people will actually learn how to drive safely on their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s why we want to tackle careless driving with proportionate sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 14 June, the government consulted on proposals to make careless driving a fixed penalty offence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorists who commit less severe examples of the offence - such as driving too close to another vehicle - would be offered training to help them improve their safety skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if anyone knows the benefits of driver education and training, then it’s this Institution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You understand the positive impact it can have on road safety by preventing collisions and crashes from taking place in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="older-drivers"&gt;Older drivers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also recognise the impact of changing demographics on motoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so do I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Simon pointed out, with an ageing population the number of older drivers on our roads is set to increase over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the report you’ve just launched about older drivers is a welcome contribution to the on-going debate about what this might mean for road safety and road users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the overall aim must be to maintain a balance between freedom of movement for older drivers and road safety for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; is not considering compulsory testing for older drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I’m concerned the crucial factor for road safety is not age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters is skills and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters is the physical and mental fitness of the driver to drive competently and safely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that applies to young drivers as well as older drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognise that we have to do everything we can to make sure young motorists are as safe as they can be on our highways, whether they are driving on the motorway, through town or along country lanes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the safety and ability of young drivers is a key priority for the government which is why we have adapted the driving test to reflect real conditions on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of ongoing measures to reduce the risks of accidents, the department is working with young people, the insurance industry, and other partners to identify what more can be done - and we are considering several options to ensure that newly qualified drivers are properly prepared and able to drive safely &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the use of telematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-car technology like this means insurers now have a real time data feed which allows them to see an individual’s driving behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some evidence suggests that young drivers could see their annual premiums fall by 20% more with a black box installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But research so far also shows that telematics can significantly reduce crash rates and levels of risky driving behaviours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome the increasing number of insurers who are making use of this technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are supportive of any measures that make driving safer and also want to see improvements in young driver safety reflected in their insurance premiums. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="closing-remarks"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I was always taught that there isn’t much point in silent gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as well as thanking everyone here for your hospitality today, I’d also like to say a big ‘thank-you’ to the Institute itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you don’t just campaign for safer roads - you actively do something to make them a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than half a century you have raised driving and riding standards and improved the skills of road users, both on two wheels and four wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down the years you have helped to prevent accidents, save lives and make Britain’s highways some of the safest on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as the Road Safety Minister, I want to pay tribute to everyone at the Institute - your hard work and your expertise makes a real and lasting difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Speed limit exemption for life-saving services</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proposals to allow drivers from a wider range of emergency services to break the speed limit in order to save lives, have been published today for consultation by Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police, fire and ambulance services are already allowed to exceed speed limits in the course of their emergency response duties and this is not changing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3 month consultation exercise will examine the possibility of extending the exemption to other services including those carrying organs for transplant, bomb disposal units and coastguard vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will also look at amending road safety legislation so that emergency drivers would be required by law to complete high-speed training before exceeding the limit. But this will not place any additional burden on police, fire and ambulance services which already run an effective voluntary training scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Police, fire and ambulance service drivers are highly trained individuals who are at times required to exceed the speed limit in order to save lives. It is only right that we look at allowing other services whose duties can mean the difference between life and death to exceed the speed limit when responding to emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is also time to look at the legal requirements of emergency vehicle training so we can build on the rigorous standards the police, fire and ambulance services have already applied through their code of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While emergency service drivers are not exempt from the offences of dangerous and careless driving, the current legislation allows drivers in some circumstances to break speed limits legally as well as exempting them from certain traffic regulations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation document can be viewed on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/speed-limit-exemptions"&gt;DfT website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Services currently exempt from speed limits include Police, the Fire Service, the Ambulance Service and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (shortly to be replaced by the National Crime Agency)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The full list of services who have expressed an interest in being exempt are listed within section 5 of the consultation document, they include Ministry of Defence bomb disposal units, fire (other than for fire and rescue authorities which are covered), conveyance of human tissue for transplant, blood transfusion, mountain rescue, mine rescue, radiation emergencies, coastguard and lifeboat launching&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The emergency services set up a joint emergency services’ speed limit exemption driver training group to develop their procedures. It also includes representatives from the Driving Standards Agency, the Institute of Advanced Motoring and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. It has developed a Code of Practice which is based around current best practice for each of the exempt organisations and reflects what is being taught there, recognising that there are organisation specific competencies. The consultation proposes using this Code of Practice as the basis for the regulated standards for the mandatory training courses to be used following the proposed legislative change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The consultation includes a set of criteria designed to establish the rationale of each request, balancing the operational need for the exemption against any potential road safety risk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The consultation proposes amending the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 and make any legal exemption dependent on drivers attaining the core competencies identified in the Emergency Services’ Code of Practice&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Speed limit exemptions for emergency vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department has today published a consultation paper on Speed Limit Exemptions for vehicles used for emergency purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation paper proposes that Section 19 of the Road Safety Act (2006) is brought into effect. Section 19 allows the Secretary of State for Transport to designate other vehicle purposes as being exempt from speed limits in certain circumstances and if drivers of said vehicles complete successfully a “high-speed training course”.  Section 19 replaces Section 87 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act (1984) in relation to exemptions from speed limits for certain vehicle purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department recognises that there are certain vehicle purposes that the wider public may well consider as having a speed limit exemptions but which do not currently.  These include, for example, vehicles used to carry human tissue for transplant, mountain rescue teams, bomb disposal squads and others listed in the consultation document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branches of the Emergency Services (Police, Fire Service &amp;amp; Ambulance Service) are currently exempt from speed limits and provide appropriate training to their staff.  No additional requirements will be placed on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has worked with representatives of the police, fire and rescue, NHS ambulance services, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and road safety stakeholders on the development of standards for driver training.   This led to the creation of a code of practice based on the principles applied in each organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department seeks to identify the core competencies specified in the code of practice and include them in regulations. It also proposes that the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) will take responsibility for the accrediting and quality assuring training providers seeking to provide high speed driver training courses, against the competences identified in the code of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration within the consultation document is to exempt paramedics and other medical personnel from the requirements to wear seatbelts in the back of ambulances, particularly when providing emergency treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Tough new measures to tackle drink drivers</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A package of tough measures to crack down on drink drivers has been unveiled today by Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included in the proposals are plans to remove the statutory right to a replacement blood or urine test where a breath test reading is above and close to the legal limit, closing the loophole which allows those testing positive in breath to sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also intends to legislate to allow police the option not to perform a preliminary breath test where roadside evidential breath tests are carried out following the rollout of roadside evidential breath testing devices and give registered health care professionals greater roles in testing drink drivers - both of which options would speed up the enforcement process and deal with more drink drivers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have made great progress in tackling drink drivers and the 2011 fatality figure for drink and drive accidents is the second lowest ever recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, last year 280 people died ruining the lives of families up and down the country so more needs to be done to eradicate this menace. That is why we are taking forward a package of measures to streamline enforcement against drink driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am determined to make the jobs of those who deal with drink drivers easier and less bureaucratic so that bringing offenders to justice is not left to chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, drivers who record less than 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath have the right to demand a blood or urine test - despite being over the legal limit of 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres. This is known as the statutory option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option dates back to the original introduction of breathalyser technology when there were concerns over reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his review of drink and drug driving Sir Peter North recommended the removal of the right to demand a blood or urine test as evidence showed people were using it as a delaying tactic. The government also believes that improvements in the accuracy of technology means that this option is no longer necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/government/consultations/enforcement-procedures-against-drink-drivers-and-other-offenders"&gt;consultation also seeks views&lt;/a&gt; on removing the requirement for a preliminary breath test where roadside evidential breath testing is used. At the moment, when a suspected drink driver is pulled over by police, they undergo a preliminary breath test and are then taken to a police station for a further evidential test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from the evidential test taken at police stations are the only ones used as evidence. Under the new plans, following the introduction of mobile evidential testing devices the police could perform the eventual test at the roadside so the preliminary test would not be required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also want to see a wider range of registered healthcare professionals given the power to take evidential blood samples in hospitals and to assess whether a driver may have a condition due to a drug. This will enable tests to be carried out more swiftly, easing the pressure on doctors who are currently the only professionals with the authority to carry out the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other proposals within the plans include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commissioning further research into the current process used to decide whether a driver banned due to drink driving can regain their licence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;further exploration of how greater use can be made of vehicle forfeiture powers to get the most dangerous and irresponsible motorists off the road, including drink drivers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation encompasses the legislative changes the government proposed in its response of March 2011 to the reports by Sir Peter North and the Transport Select Committee on drink and drug driving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation period runs until 2 January 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile breath testing devices are still subject to type approval by the Centre for Applied Science and Technology and have not yet been deployed.&lt;/li&gt;
