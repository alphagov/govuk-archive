    <title>The Port of Dover</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Dover Port transfer scheme decision announced.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2010 Dover Harbour Board (DHB) submitted a voluntary transfer scheme in accordance with section 9 of the Ports Act 1991, which allows a relevant port authority to voluntarily submit a transfer scheme, which, if confirmed by the Secretary of State for Transport, would allow the port to be privatised.  This was followed by a statutory consultation period on Dover’s transfer scheme that ended on 25 March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 16 May 2011 the then Secretary of State for Transport, The &lt;abbr title="Right Honourable"&gt;Rt Hon&lt;/abbr&gt; Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Philip Hammond), launched a consultation on the criteria that the government considers relevant when considering the appropriateness of the sale of a major trust port. The revised criteria - Secretary of State for Transport’s guidance note concerning procedure for the sale of trust ports - was published on 3 August 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the revised criteria, DHB submitted more information in June 2012, and there was a further 6-week period for representations which ended on 27 July 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took over as decision minister from the &lt;abbr title="Right Honourable"&gt;Rt Hon&lt;/abbr&gt; Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers) in September 2012 and wish to announce the decision, on behalf of the Secretary of State, to the House today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decided not to confirm DHB’s transfer scheme. I reached my conclusion taking into account the published policy. I concluded that the transfer scheme proposed would not ensure a sufficient level of enduring community participation in the port. I also concluded that so far as the board made the application in order to be able to obtain the additional finance necessary to undertake the proposed redevelopment of the Western Docks, there were other options available to secure that redevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/government/publications/dover-transfer-scheme-decision-letter"&gt;full decision letter will be available on the department’s website&lt;/a&gt; shortly after this statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My honourable friend, the Parliamentary under Secretary of State, &lt;abbr title="Honourable"&gt;Hon&lt;/abbr&gt; Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond), as Minister for Maritime will now discuss with DHB, their plans for the future of the port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Passengers come first in new Civil Aviation Act </title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Civil Aviation Act has become law today and paves the way for airports to offer better facilities and information for passengers.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passengers have today been placed firmly at the heart of UK airport regulation as a new Civil Aviation Act becomes law. The Act paves the way for the Civil Aviation Authority (&lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;) to motivate airports to deliver better facilities, provide more information for passengers and give greater incentives for airports to prepare for disruptive events such as severe weather. The Act also makes provisions for future reforms to the Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing (&lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt;) scheme, which offers financial protection for holiday makers in the event of their tour operator going bust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Act sees a number of key changes to the powers and responsibilities of the aviation regulator, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;giving the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; a single overriding duty, for its airport economic functions, to further the interests of passengers and owners of cargo in the provision of airport operation services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creating a flexible licensing regime for regulated airports, enabling the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; to include licence conditions that require airports to respond more effectively when things go wrong (e.g. severe weather)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allowing the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;, where appropriate, to replace fixed price caps on airports with lighter touch forms of regulation and removing unnecessary central government involvement from airport regulation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; more effective enforcement powers, allowing it to impose sanctions of up to 10% of an airport operator’s annual turnover and daily amounts of 0.1% of turnover for breaching licence conditions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; with a new role in promoting better public information about airline and airport performance levels, enabling passengers to make informed decisions when making travel arrangements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; with a new role to promote better public information about the environmental effects of aviation and measures taken to mitigate adverse effects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conferring certain aviation security functions currently carried out by the Department for Transport, on to the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;. Responsibility for aviation security policy, and giving aviation security directions to industry, will remain with the Secretary of State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Act also enables Ministers to make future changes to the &lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt; holiday protection scheme, including the ability to bring holidays sold by airlines into the scope of the scheme. Earlier this year, the government introduced secondary legislation to update the &lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt; holiday protection scheme, making it more relevant to today’s market. The new powers in the Act will enable the protection available to consumers to be further strengthened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aviation Minister Simon Burns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is an important milestone in our drive to put the passenger experience unequivocally at the heart of how our airports are run.  Aviation is vital for providing the UK with the connections we need to do business, travel for leisure and visit our friends and families around the world.  I am grateful for the cross-party support this Act has received during its passage through Parliament – ensuring passengers and those sending cargo can enjoy the benefits of this new regime as swiftly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the Act has received Royal Assent, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; will work to bring the new airport economic regulatory framework fully into force in April 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Act introduces, and enables, reform in 4 main areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the framework for economic regulation of airports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the legislative framework of the Civil Aviation Authority&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing scheme (&lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conferring certain aviation security functions currently carried out by the Department for Transport, on to the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; - responsibility for aviation security policy remains with the Secretary of State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new regulatory regime for airports, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; is empowered to carry out a market power test, as set out in the Act, to determine whether an airport operator should or should not be subject to economic regulation. This replaces the designation of airports for price control regulation by the Secretary of State. Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports are currently designated and their current price controls, set under the Airports Act 1986, will continue to run until 31 March 2014. Over the next 18 months, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; will determine how to apply the new regime set out in the Act to the airports that are subject to economic regulation after this date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the existing regime, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; has 4 duties for the purposes of economic regulation, these are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to further the reasonable interests of users of airports within the UK. Users comprises airlines, passengers and other user of air transport services at the airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to promote the efficient, economic and profitable operation of such airports &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to encourage investment in new facilities at airports in time to satisfy anticipated demands by the users of such airports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to impose the minimum restrictions that are consistent with the performance by the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; of its functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; is also required to take account of international obligations notified to it by the Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures set out today will replace these with a single primary duty and a number of further duties to which the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; must have regard in carrying out the primary duty for the purposes of airport economic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="primary-duty"&gt;Primary duty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to further the interests of passengers and owners of cargo (both present and future), in the provision of airport operation services and to do so, wherever appropriate, by promoting competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="further-duties"&gt;Further duties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to ensure that licence holders are able to finance their provision of airport operation services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to secure that all reasonable demands for airport operation services are met&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to promote economy and efficiency on the part of licence holders in their provision of airport operation services at regulated airports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to secure that licence holders are able to take reasonable measures to reduce, control or mitigate adverse environmental effects of the airport to which the licence relates and aircraft using that airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to have regard to any international obligation of the UK notified to it by the Secretary of State&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to have regard to the principles of better regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; will have a duty not to impose or maintain unnecessary burdens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expanded regulation-making powers in the Act would allow more holidays to be included in the &lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt; scheme and would provide even greater clarity for consumers whilst ensuring a level regulatory playing field for businesses selling flight-inclusive holidays. The government’s intention is that such a step would only be taken following full consultation with stakeholders including an impact assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Industry launches new rail technical strategy</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New techniques and technologies to improve the performance and cost-effectiveness of the railway.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail industry leaders have outlined a 30 year vision for the railway through a new edition of the ‘Rail technical strategy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Rail technical strategy’ describes how technology can help the railway increase capacity, improve reliability, cut carbon emissions and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy has been developed by the Technical Strategy Leadership Group – a cross-industry expert body with representatives from across the rail industry – and endorsed by the Rail Delivery Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.futurerailway.org"&gt;Read the Rail technical strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister of State for Transport  Simon Burns MP welcomed the strategy saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the industry picking up the baton to develop this Rail technical strategy. Technology has a vital role to play in improving the railway’s performance, cutting its costs along with carbon emissions and delivering a better travelling experience for passengers. By setting in place a 30 year vision, the railway is demonstrating that it has a bright and exciting future, and the potential to support our economy and society for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK Air-Rail Conference</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>The economic importance of air-rail connections, and the government’s record of investment and modernisation.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along, it’s a genuine pleasure to be here this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="no-nation-was-ever-ruined-by-trade"&gt;No nation was ever ruined by trade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Benjamin Franklin, one of America’s founding fathers, who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No nation was ever ruined by trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That statement was spot on when Ben Franklin made it back in the 18th century and it is spot on today, in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade is Britain’s economic lifeblood. We’re an island nation that’s at our best when we’re a trading nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the very reason this government is re-balancing our economy - moving Britain from a ‘spend and borrow’ past to a ‘make and sell’ future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if they’re going to trade, then our entrepreneurs have to connect - connect with customers and markets, connect with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the modern world that usually means a business trip and a seat on a plane - which also means a journey to an airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why air-rail links matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the theme of your conference rightly reminds us, these links are all about ‘connecting for growth’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now ‘growth’ is the word on everyone’s lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s hardly surprising in these testing times of a Eurozone crisis, a fragile global economy and a record-breaking inherited debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while there is sill a long way to go, recent economic figures show we are moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do think there is a tendency in some quarters to talk about growth as though it’s an abstract concept - something that’s separate and stand-alone; something with a life-force all of its very own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost as though some commentators believe growth will magically appear of its own volition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that it’ll come about if you say the word often enough, or you want it badly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well actually, out there in the real world, you can’t talk or wish an economy into growing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t wave a wand and conjure up growth from thin air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can’t sit back and wait for it to fall in your lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth comes through hard slog: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the competitive company and the skilled workforce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the inventors and innovators &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the risk takers and wealth creators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and yes… a supportive and empowering government &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is who and what drives growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s where transport can play such a massive part - by providing the vital connections that help to support and sustain growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the bottom line is - the government understands the overriding economic imperative of modernising our railways, our airports and the links between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="railways"&gt;Railways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me take each of those areas in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the railways, where we’re engaged in a massive effort to renew and rebuild Britain’s rail networks - and just this summer we announced a new rail investment programme worth more than £9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re driving through landmark projects like Crossrail, Thameslink and the Northern Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to electrify more than 850 miles of track, compared to the 10 miles electrified by the last administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, right across the country, we’re making rail travel a whole lot better with new services and extra carriages, more seats and faster journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our focus doesn’t begin and end with the conventional railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also recognise the huge potential benefits of high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know that our country and our economy need more than a high speed line - they need a high speed network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what we’re going to build with &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only links London and Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also speeds further north to Manchester and Leeds, and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only opens up business opportunities at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also opens up business opportunities abroad by ensuring passengers have an opportunity to connect up with the Channel Tunnel rail link (HS1) and Heathrow airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will, of course, give people much quicker journey times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is so much more than simply a faster way to get from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; also means more capacity and better connected cities and regions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which, in turn, means that British businesses will be able to use it to exploit new markets, win new customers and attract new investment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will create and support tens of thousands of jobs and so help to power up the recovery and put people back to work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also help to deliver better life chances for millions of people by opening up access to employment opportunities and essential services like education and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s even a persuasive environmental case for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because it will offer people and businesses a high speed, low carbon alternative to short-haul flying and long-distance motoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no exaggeration to say that &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will transform the way we live and work every bit as much as it transforms the way we travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So make no mistake - the government’s commitment to this game-changing project is full on and flat out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="airports"&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now turn to the subject of airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Wright Brothers defied gravity in a box-shaped biplane made of spruce and covered in cotton, air travel has shrunk our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in doing so, it has also broadened our horizons, personal and business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So airports have a front and centre role in keeping our country prosperous, as well as keeping it connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we’re working hard to make sure the aviation sector continues to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the Civil Aviation Bill, legislation that will improve the passenger experience by reforming the 25 year old set of regulations that currently govern our main airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve consulted on our draft Aviation Policy Framework - a framework that forms the basis for future sustainable aviation growth in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, to increase reliability and reduce delays, we’ve been trialling operational freedoms at Heathrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thinking ahead too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to make sure that the future of aviation in Britain is one where our airports are globally competitive and where you can connect to places all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m not talking about the future as just the next 4 or 5 years, but in terms of the next 4 and 5 decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aviation faces long-term challenges that require long-term solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lots of people and lots of organisations have ideas about what those solutions should look like including, I’m sure, many of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports’ Commission to explore the evidence, consider the options and make recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Howard has now named the members of his commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its terms of reference have been published. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job of work is underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so let me be clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is determined to build the consensus needed to deliver a lasting solution to this country’s aviation needs, and we believe that the Airports’ Commission is the way to do precisely that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="air-rail-links"&gt;Air-rail links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you take a look at this country’s major airports you will probably notice any number of things that mark them out and make them unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look again though and you’ll also see there are 2 things they have in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they act as global gateways to new markets and new customers - which means they are not just national transport assets, they are national economic assets too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But second, they’re set to become much easier places to get to and fly from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because we’re making real and lasting improvements to those crucial connections between the train and the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me highlight some of the key investments and modernisations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;electrification of the Midland Mainline improves access to Luton, while Valleys electrification improves access to Cardiff Airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;electrification and capacity enhancements between Leamington and Coventry enables more Crosscountry trains to run via Birmingham Airport &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extra platform capacity at Redhill means more opportunity for Gatwick services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in Greater Manchester the Metrolink tram extension is due to open in 2016 and will take passengers from the city centre into Manchester Airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as part of the Northern Hub improvements, there will be an extra platform at Manchester Airport, which will allow more and longer trains to serve the airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;investment in the Ordsall Chord and additional platforms at Piccadilly station means that trains from Bradford, Halifax and Rochdale will be able to get to Manchester Airport for the first time &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new £500 million rail link will give direct western access to Heathrow Airport and is expected to cut passenger journey times from the Thames Valley, the south-west, Wales and the west Midlands by around half an hour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;once it’s completed, Crossrail will provide new services linking Heathrow with the West End, the City of London and Canary Wharf.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thanks to Thameslink, Gatwick will get new direct services to destinations north of London, such as Cambridge, Stevenage and Welwyn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, not only will &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; make it much easier for passengers from London and the south-east to get to Birmingham Airport… &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will also mean that people and businesses in the Midlands and the north of England get improved access to Heathrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an impressive list of projects and programmes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if you add it all up, what you get are train services that work for rail passengers and air passengers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks"&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay - whenever I make a speech I’m always conscious of the words of President Bill Clinton who gave the following advice about public speaking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;if you can’t say what you want to say in 20 minutes or less, you should go away and write a book about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m sure that lovers of literature everywhere will be greatly relieved to know that I have no plans whatsoever to be an author - which means it’s time for me to conclude my speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I finish up though there’s something I want you to know, and it’s this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting for growth isn’t just at the top of your priority list – it’s right at the heart of our transport policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seamless air-rail journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better, faster, closer links between the station platform and the check-in desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s our vision, that’s our ambition and, step by step, that’s what we’re delivering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Widespread support for greater rail devolution</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Consultation responses published today reveal widespread support for rail devolution.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passengers and local communities could achieve better rail services and value for money for taxpayers if they have more say on how their railways are run, according to responses to a government consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feedback published today also reveals widespread support for rail devolution. The consultation asked individuals, regional groups and interested organisations to give their views on how devolution might work and what the benefits were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rail Minister Simon Burns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are determined to provide the best possible rail services for passengers and ensure that we reduce the cost of running our railways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ensuring decisions are taken by those best placed to make them – those who live and work in those areas – could make certain not only that services are planned to maximise value for money for taxpayers but that passengers get services they need and want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation also revealed enthusiastic expressions of interest in helping to manage the railways from regional groups in London, the West Midlands and the north of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responses highlighted the success of regions where the operation of rail services has already been devolved, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merseyside, where Merseytravel has been responsible for the management of rail services since 2003&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London, where Transport for London has been responsible for the operation of London Overground services since 2007&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scotland and Wales, where the operation of regional services is managed by the Scottish government and the Welsh Assembly government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses also showed support for transport models specifically designed for particular regions on the basis of local geography and the structure of local networks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A consultation document, ‘Rail decentralisation’, was published on 8 March 2012. Comments were invited by the end of June 2012. This is available on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/rail-decentralisation-devolving-decision-making-on-passenger-rail-services-in-england"&gt;the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Department for Transport’s response to the rail decentralisation consultation is available on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/rail-decentralisation-devolving-decision-making-on-passenger-rail-services-in-england"&gt;the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government remains committed to seeking to implement an appropriate form of decentralisation in those parts of England where it is sensible to do so. Following the responses to the consultation, &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; will continue informal discussions with those bodies who have submitted proposals or firm expressions of interest. It will consider further a number of issues that need to be resolved in order to proceed with any decentralisation agreement, subject to any changes to franchising policy which may emerge from the Brown review of the rail franchising programme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most train services are specified, procured and funded centrally by the Department for Transport in London. A public consultation has shown broad support for devolving greater responsibility for local rail services to local authorities, Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs) and Transport for London, where conditions are right&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proposals for decentralisation have been received from the Rail in the North consortium comprising Transport for Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire PTE with York City Council and South Yorkshire PTE; Centro and Transport for London&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expressions of interest have been received from West of England Partnership (the Greater Bristol area), Devon and Cornwall Councils, Merseytravel, the Association of North East Councils and Cumbria County Council&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is envisaged that interested bodies will be ready to submit formal proposals in the first half of next year. In the meantime, the Department for Transport will continue informal discussions with these bodies as they prepare and consult on their formal proposal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Around 70% of respondents to the consultation said they supported devolution of powers to manage the railways to regional bodies&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Westbourne HS2 Alliance dinner</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by the Rt Hon Simon Burns MP, Minister of State for Transport.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction James (James Bethall, Westbourne Comms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough the importance of the work the Alliance does to build up a coalition of support for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We value your support for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; and we need other organisations to continue make the case for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; in a positive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your efforts are highly regarded and greatly appreciated, so it’s a genuine pleasure to be with you all this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-only-game-in-town"&gt;The only game in town&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac Singer, the Polish-American author and Noble Prize winner, once told a journalist: “We have to believe in free will. We’ve got no choice”.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s pretty much how I feel about high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I’m convinced that a high speed rail network won’t simply transform the way we travel in Britain, it will also transform the way we live, work and do business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And transform it for generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also one hundred per cent certain that opting out of a high speed future would be a disaster for Britain, a missed opportunity we’d regret for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for me, there’s only one choice that makes sense for our country’s success and our children’s future, and that’s &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is the only game in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bigger-picture"&gt;Bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; debate, we can talk about the line of route, design and technology or even mitigation measures and compensation packages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of these things matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also vital that we never ever lose sight of the bigger picture - the long-term potential of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the brief time I have tonight, that’s what Id like to focus on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="economic-potential"&gt;Economic potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;’s economic potential:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will mean faster journey times, more capacity and better connected cities and regions - which, in turn, means that British businesses will be able to use it to exploit new markets and win new customers both at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also create and support tens of thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; can help to power up the recovery and put people back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="social-potential"&gt;Social potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will help to close the decades’ long north-south divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will help to open up access to employment opportunities and essential services like education and health for millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in a very real sense, a high speed rail network is as much about delivering better life chances as it is about getting from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="environmental-potential"&gt;Environmental potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me then, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; makes economic and social sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can also see a persuasive environmental case for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because I really do believe that &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will offer people and businesses a high speed, low carbon alternative to short-haul flying and long-distance motoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="willing-to-accept-unwilling-to-postpone-determined-to-meet"&gt;Willing to accept, unwilling to postpone, determined to meet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I look at the bigger &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; picture I don’t just see an investment in a high &lt;abbr title="technology"&gt;tech&lt;/abbr&gt;, high capacity, high speed rail network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see an investment in a stronger economy, a fairer society and a cleaner and greener environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why it has my full on and flat commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that building high speed rail will be a test of Britain’s energy and skills. And yes, I know this challenge is as big as they come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also know this country - .its people and its companies, its spirit and resolve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I am absolutely convinced it’s a challenge that we in Britain are willing to accept, unwilling to postpone and determined to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="closing-remarks"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, when I first started out in politics I was told that the Golden Rule of public speaking was exhaust neither the subject nor the audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, down the years I’ve discovered another rule - never keep an audience from their dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, ahead of our dinner and discussion, it only remains for me to say thank you for listening and here’s to a night of good food and great conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister views multi-billion pound plans for the north-west</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Major upgrades to rail links in the north west are progressing well.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major upgrade to rail links which will bring over £4 billion of economic benefits to the north-west is progressing well, said Transport Minister Simon Burns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister visited Manchester and Liverpool today to see for himself work on the Northern Hub and plans for the electrification of rail lines – both projects could bring up to 30,000 jobs to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Hub will see a new rail link being built (the Ordsall Chord), stations extended and journey times improved while the electrification programme will enable faster, more reliable and greener trains to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Burns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Transport provides the crucial links that allow individuals and communities to prosper and that is why this investment is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Commuters and businesses in the region will be big winners thanks to quicker and greener trains and more services across Manchester. But these improvements will also benefit the UK as a whole due the crucial role the north-west plays in the country’s transport system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This investment demonstrates that the government is delivering on its commitment not only to improve the transport system but also to use it as an engine to drive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his visit the minister toured Manchester Airport and Manchester Airport railway station where he viewed plans for a 4th railway platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new platform will increase capacity by enabling the station to accommodate longer and more trains. He also visited Piccadilly station which will have extra platforms as part of the Northern Hub project and toured Tuebrook Sidings, in Liverpool, which is 1 of 13 compounds which will be used to store materials during the 2nd phase of the north-west electrification scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Northern Hub is a series of proposed projects to boost economic growth through better train services across northern England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The individual projects were identified in a study published by Network Rail in February 2010&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In July 2012 the government announced it was backing the full scheme. The full package of enhancements is set to be in place by 2019&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s electrification programme will also see rail lines on the Great Western Main Line electrified all the way to the South Wales Valleys. The Midland Main Line between Bedford and Sheffield will also be electrified&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A study by Network Rail estimates the investment will bring over £4 billion of wider economic benefits to the north-west resulting in 30,000 new jobs&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Nuneaton North Chord event</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by the Rt Hon Simon Burns MP, Minister of State for Transport.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for asking me along today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m genuinely delighted to be here because what you’ve achieved with this new chord really matters. And let me tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, today we earn our living in a global marketplace - one where what we sell in Boston or Shanghai is just as important as what we make in Bristol or Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that rail freight is more important than it’s ever been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving products and raw materials quickly and reliably - that’s how you power up the recovery and grow the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="economic-sense-environmental-sense"&gt;Economic sense, environmental sense&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although this new chord isn’t massive in scale like Crossrail or &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;, it’s certainly a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investment worth more than £25 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investment that will allow freight traffic to travel through Nuneaton station, without affecting passenger services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investment that means better and faster links between the global gateway of Felixstowe and the Midlands, the north west and Scotland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this new chord makes sound economic sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you consider the chord’s potential to cut carbon emissions and ease traffic congestion by attracting freight from road to rail, then it soon becomes obvious that it makes environmental sense too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusions---right-investment-right-project-right-reasons"&gt;Conclusions - right investment, right project, right reasons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add all that up and what you have is the right investment, in the right project, for the right reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, before I finish I just want to say a big thank you to everyone who made this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have done a terrific job of work and, if I had a hat, I’d take it off to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on that note it is now my absolute pleasure to declare the Nuneaton North Chord officially open (minister unveils plaque).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Peterborough Station makeover – official opening</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by the Rt Hon Simon Burns MP, Minister of State for Transport.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along. It’s a genuine pleasure to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my officials first asked me if I was interested in a makeover, I thought they meant for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for my self-esteem the officials in my private office eventually put me straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The makeover is right here at Peterborough Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, looking around, I can see that every penny of that £3 million was well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-makeover-that-really-delivers"&gt;A makeover that really delivers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a new station front, a bigger main concourse and a much brighter interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a new information point, as well as a new customer waiting area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People using the station will feel safer and more secure thanks to improved &lt;abbr title="Closed Circuit Television"&gt;CCTV&lt;/abbr&gt; coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated ticket machines mean less hassle and more convenience for passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, talking of convenience, even the toilets have been refurbished.
Looked at from any angle, this is a makeover that really delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m pleased to say it doesn’t stop there. Because I understand there’s more to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be new lifts and footbridges, as well extra and longer platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all the work is due to be completed by the end of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bigger-picture"&gt;Bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, the passenger friendly changes we see here are part of a much bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we’re actually engaged in a massive rail modernisation effort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new services and extra carriages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more seats and faster journeys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;transforming conventional rail and backing rail high speed rail &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From massive, multi-billion pound projects like Crossrail, to smaller multi-million pound projects like Peterborough, we’re renewing and rebuilding Britain’s railways and making them truly fit for the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="team-effort"&gt;Team effort&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that it takes a real team effort to pull off something like this - from back office to building site, from accountants to architects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as far as I’m concerned, it doesn’t matter if you were sat in front of a computer or you wore a hard hat, or whether you’re from Network Rail or part of East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were involved in modernising this station then you should feel very proud of yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I’d like to take this opportunity to applaud you for an absolutely fantastic job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common interests and a common purpose….coming together and working together to achieve this station improving, passenger friendly end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a big thank-you for all of your hard graft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks--cutting-ribbonplaque-unveiling"&gt;Concluding remarks – cutting ribbon/plaque unveiling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience “I wish they’d gone on longer” is rarely a tribute paid to a public speaker, especially a politician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, without any further ado, it’s an honour and a privilege to declare this station open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>All party parliamentary rail in the north group reception</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by the Rt Hon Simon Burns MP, Minister of State for Transport.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introductory-remarks"&gt;Introductory remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction Julie (Julie Hilling - Chair of &lt;abbr title="All Party Parliamentary Group"&gt;APPG&lt;/abbr&gt;). And many thanks for asking me along today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reputation of this group and its members as rail champions for the north really does go before you, so I’m genuinely delighted to be here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to kick things off with a promise - always a hostage to fortune for a politician I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyway, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you all have packed diaries and busy schedules - so I promise to try and keep my speech short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to say keep it “brief”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, since becoming a minister, I’ve discovered that Whitehall is the only place on earth where, without a trace of irony, the term “brief” is used to describe a ten thousand word document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern enough, connected enough, fast enough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have a pretty straightforward view about Britain’s rail network, and it’s this - out-dated and over-burdened railways just won’t cut it in today’s global economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They cost hard working families and hard pressed businesses time and money. And, in these testing economic times, you can be sure they are anything but an engine for powering up the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t do our environment too many favours either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest, relying on creaking and crumbling rail infrastructure is no way to shrink transport’s carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it doesn’t matter if it’s a regional link or a national network - Britain needs railways that are modern enough, connected enough and fast enough:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern enough to support economic growth and spur job creation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connected enough to spread prosperity and open up life-changing chances for people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And fast enough to attract passengers and freight away from less eco-friendly alternatives like long-distance road travel and short-haul flying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="rolling-up-our-sleeves"&gt;Rolling up our sleeves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am absolutely convinced that a good rail system can do great things - socially, economically and environmentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as we all know, the good and the great don’t come about simply because politicians are very keen on them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you only get concrete results by rolling up your sleeves and getting on with it. And that’s precisely what this government’s been doing on rail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£18 billion invested in our railways during this Spending Review period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A massively ambitious programme of rail modernisation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And a range of groundbreaking reforms…. …from driving down costs and driving up efficiencies to devolving decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, on the second of those reforms, devolution, I know that there was a big response from people and organisations in the north to our rail decentralisation consultation…so I want to thank everyone who took the trouble to have their say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No community left out, no region left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a government that believes in top quality railways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that belief is underpinned by a rock-solid principle. Namely that no community should be left out, no region should be left behind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I’m concerned, if we want all of Britain to be open for business then we can’t afford for any part of Britain to be isolated or disconnected from the country’s wider transport system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local, and actually national success, demands that north, south, east and west are plugged in and joined up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transforming-the-performance-and-prospects-of-rail-in-the-north"&gt;Transforming the performance and prospects of rail in the north&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the very reason that transforming the performance and the prospects of rail in the north is a first order priority for the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when it comes to one particular component of rail services in the north, I’ll admit that the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; hasn’t enjoyed its best media coverage lately. I’m of course talking about the west coast mainline bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t for one minute seek to carp or complain about that coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serious matters tend to generate serious headlines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also demand a serious response…which is why we are facing up to what went wrong and putting things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None-the less, I genuinely hope that none of the recent coverage obscures the bigger, and more positive, picture about what’s happening to rail in the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take our recent approval of a £4.5 billion contract to build a new generation of intercity trains at a purpose-built factory in County Durham. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that passengers will be speeding along the tracks onboard new high-tech, high-spec trains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s also a welcome employment bonus, with the creation of 730 skilled jobs, as well as another 200 jobs during construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget our &lt;abbr title="High level output specification"&gt;HLOS&lt;/abbr&gt; announcement - a £9.4 billion investment programme that will uplift rail capacity and improve rail connections right across the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also pleased to say that work is well underway on the north-west electrification scheme….improving travel between Manchester and Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’re not stopping there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we also intend building a brand new electric passenger and freight corridor - a rail spine linking the towns, cities and economies of the North, with the towns, cities and economies of the Midlands and south of England such as Sheffield, Nottingham, Reading and Southampton. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electric trains that run on these lines will be cleaner and cheaper to run than diesels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ll have better acceleration and shift greater loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’ll carry more passengers with fewer delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In plain English our investment is good for passengers, good for business and good for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also tell you that funding worth some £240 million will mean that rail users in the North enjoy more seats, quicker journeys and better services on the East Coast Main Line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, the communities and companies of the region are set to be big winners from the backing the government is giving to the northern hub.&lt;br&gt;
And let me say this - the Northern Hub is about the transforming the rail experience across the whole North, from Newcastle in the north-east to Liverpool in the north-west. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in terms of travel benefits this is a genuine landmark enterprise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s even better news&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because Network Rail estimate the northern hub will also bring over £4 billion worth of wider economic benefits to the region and potentially as many twenty to thirty thousand new jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ll forgive the unintended pun, looking down the track there is another game-changing rail modernisation heading towards the North - &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This national high speed rail network will slash journey times and deliver a step change in capacity on routes between Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, London and Manchester - and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firms in the north will be able to use &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; to exploit new markets and attract new investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the region’s communities will have better access to jobs and essential services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a core component of the government’s long-term transport strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, for the sake of every region, it’s a project we’re determined to push across the finishing line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks"&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I think it’s time I kept the promise I made right at the start of this speech by winding up my remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s be frank, nobody ever complained that a politician’s’ speech was too short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if I may, I’d like to finish with a quote by one of America’s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I grant you that’s a less than orthodox way to end a rail speech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, for me, this quote sums up our approach to rail modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the 18th century Ben Franklin argued that, when it came to governing, “well done is better than well said.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask me, that’s a yardstick which still stands the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m equally sure that, judged against it, the way this government is renewing, rebuilding and reforming our railways proves that, just like the great man said - actions really do speak louder than words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This speech represented existing departmental policy but the words may not have been the same as those used by the minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
