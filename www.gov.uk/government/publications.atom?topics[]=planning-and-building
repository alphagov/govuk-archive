    <title>Guidance on the pre-application process for major infrastructure projects</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>This guidance sets out the requirements and procedures for the pre-application process and consultation for major infrastructure projects.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This document is the result of merging and expanding reworked versions of the local authority guidance and the pre-application guidance that went out to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/pre-application-process-for-planning-applications"&gt;consultation&lt;/a&gt; on 13 April 2012. By merging these, we are avoiding unnecessary repetition of the description of common processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new guidance sets out the necessary requirements and procedures and gives clarity on the scope and scale of the consultation required at the pre-application stage. It covers all the main processes required by an applicant prior to the submission of an application, including the pre-application consultation, Environmental Impact Assessment, Habitats Regulations Assessments, and advice on drafting a Development Consent Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Changes to Temporary Stop Notices consultation</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>Consultation on proposals to improve councils' power to tackle unauthorised development.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation is on the proposal to revoke Statutory Instrument 2005/206 under the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/206/contents/made"&gt;Town and Country Planning (Temporary Stop Notice)(England) Regulations 2005&lt;/a&gt;. The regulation currently restricts councils use of Temporary Stop Notices on unauthorised sites where a caravan is used as a main residence. This can discourage local councils from serving stop notices where it may be beneficial to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals in this consultation would give local councils greater freedom to make a decision on the basis of local circumstances and on whether serving Temporary Stop Notices in respect of caravans used as main residences is appropriate. It will remain for local councils to consider the consequences of taking enforcement action and whether the action is necessary and proportionate in the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is an EU measure designed to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of carbon produced by buildings. The requirements of the Directive were implemented on a phased basis by the Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key requirements were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy performance certificate to be produced on the sale, rent or construction of a building&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;display energy certificate to be produced and displayed in large public buildings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;air conditioning equipment above a certain size to be inspected regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes have been made to the regulations, to transpose the requirements of a recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in England and Wales. The main requirements will be introduced on 9 January 2013 and are summarised below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;property advertisements to include details of energy performance certificate rating where available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no longer a requirement to attach front page of the energy performance certificate to written material&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extension of current requirement for a display energy certificate in large public buildings, to public buildings above 500m².  Unlike buildings larger than 1,000m²,  display energy certificates for smaller public buildings will be valid for 10 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;energy performance certificate to be displayed in commercial premises larger than 500m² where one has been previously issued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance documents have been revised to reflect the changes and can be viewed via the links above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new regulations consolidate all existing regulations which have been revoked. They are available at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/" title="legislation.gov.uk"&gt;legislation.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The government also announced clarifications to the guidance in relation to local councils and their development plan, and in relation to ensuring evidence submitted at appeal is manifestly accurate and truthful.

    <title>Building regulations: access statements, security, changing places toilets and regulation 7</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>Overview of the consultation on changes to the building regulations system and details of various technical aspects of the regulations.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation paper sets out the detailed proposals on parts A, B, C, K, M and N, access statements, security, changing places toilet and regulation 7, and is section 1 of 4, relating to the 2012 building regulations consultation exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 1 provides an overview of the consultation package as a whole as well as proposals on a number of areas including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replacing the currently referenced standards in part A (structure) with the new British Standards based on Eurocodes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;aligning the existing guidance in Approved Document C (site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture) with the most up-to-date radon maps to ensure the safety provisions are targeted appropriately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clarifying the guidance on access statements in Approved Document M (access to and use of buildings)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalising the guidance supporting parts M, K and N (access, protection from falling, collision and impact and glazing respectively) to remove unnecessary costs on business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making minor changes to the technical guidance in Approved Document B (fire safety) to resolve practical problems in the application of requirement B2 (internal fire spread (linings))&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting out the intention to take forward the repeal of the fire protection provisions in the Local Acts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting out the non-regulatory approach proposed in relation to domestic security and changing places toilets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="draft-approved-documents"&gt;Draft Approved Documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published alongside this section of the consultation is a draft version of a new Approved Document K (protection from falling, collision and impact). Not only does this reflect the proposed changes resulting from the rationalisation of parts K, M and N, it also seeks consultees’ views on the proposed new style of Approved Documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new style has also been applied to a draft revised Approved Document regulation 7 which can be found in the main consultation document as annex I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="other-consultation-sections"&gt;Other consultation sections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other consultation sections cover the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-conservation-of-fuel-and-power"&gt;section 2: part L (conservation of fuel and power)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-electrical-safety"&gt;section 3: part P (electrical safety - dwellings)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>Consultation about changes to the building regulations that relate to the energy efficiency of buildings (part L).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation paper sets out the detailed proposals on part L of the building regulations. It is section 2 of 4 of the 2012 building regulations consultation exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes proposals for tighter carbon dioxide emission standards for new homes and non-domestic buildings, to take the next step towards zero carbon standards, plus tighter performance standards for works to existing buildings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper also contains proposals to introduce, on a phased basis, requirements for additional energy efficiency improvements to be carried out when other specified works (eg extensions) are planned and Green Deal finance is available as an option to meet the up-front costs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (&lt;abbr title="Energy Performance of Buildings Directive"&gt;EPBD&lt;/abbr&gt;) became part of EU law in December 2002. The &lt;abbr title="Energy Performance of Buildings Directive"&gt;EPBD&lt;/abbr&gt; has been implemented into law via the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/991/contents/made"&gt;Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007&lt;/a&gt; (S.I. 2007/991 as amended) (“the 2007 regulations”) in respect of sales and lettings, and in regulation 29 to 33 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2214/contents/made"&gt;Building Regulations 2010&lt;/a&gt; (S.I. 2010/2214 as amended or superseded) (the Building Regulations) in respect of the duty on construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulation 24 of the Building Regulations 2010 (the Building Regulations) requires the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (the Secretary of State) to approve a National Calculation Methodology (&lt;abbr title="National Calculation Methodology"&gt;NCM&lt;/abbr&gt;) for calculating the energy performance of buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All software that is used to assess the energy performance of buildings must be validated to ensure that it operates in a manner, and to a standard, consistent with the &lt;abbr title="National Calculation Methodology"&gt;NCM&lt;/abbr&gt; before it can be approved by the Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please see the attached latest list of approved software for the production of non domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), Domestic Energy Performance Certificates (DECs) and Air Conditioning Inspection Reports (ACIRs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
