    <title>Technical review of planning appeal procedures</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published: 1 November 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is consulting on a set of proposals to make the planning appeals process faster and more transparent, improve consistency and certainty in decision taking timescales. The proposals will bring cost and time benefits for those appealing decisions and local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Extending permitted development rights for homeowners and businesses: technical consultation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes changes to increase permitted development rights for extensions to homes and business premises in non-protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is consulting on a set of proposals to amend the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 to allow homeowners and businesses to make larger extensions to their homes and business premises without requiring a planning application, and to allow quicker installation of broadband infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Strategic environmental assessment about revoking the North East regional strategy: environmental report</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environmental report is a consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revocation of the North East of England Plan and the regional economic strategy (which together form the regional strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report succeeds the previous environmental report on the revocation of the North East of England regional strategy which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012. It is a stand alone document the intention of which is to provide the reader with an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of the revocation of the North East of England Plan and the regional economic strategy without the need to refer back to the previous environmental report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report proposes to retain the saved structure plan policy S5 from the Northumberland County and National Park Joint Structure Plan First Alteration relating to the green belt at Morpeth. Removing this policy before the council has adopted a local plan which defines green belt boundaries could put green belt land at risk from unwanted development. This is in line with the Coalition Agreement to safeguard green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Proposed transfer of Homes and Communities Agency functions and assets to Milton Keynes Council</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a request by Milton Keynes Council to take greater strategic control of growth and delivery in their area, they asked to acquire full control of planning functions. Currently the Homes and Community Agency is responsible for considering certain types of planning applications for specific areas of Milton Keynes (mainly the areas designated as ‘expansion areas’).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many strands to this transfer package, this document seeks views on the transfer of those planning functions back to Milton Keynes Council only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Planning guarantee monitoring report</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planning guarantee was announced as part of the government’s plan for growth on 21 March 2011, alongside a number of other proposals to streamline the planning application process and related consents. Further details of how the guarantee is intended to operate were set out on 29 July 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle no application should spend more than 26 weeks with either the planning authority or the Planning Inspectorate if the guarantee is to be met. This monitoring report sets out planning authority and Planning Inspectorate performance against a 26-week target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is considering what further measures may be necessary to support the operation of the guarantee, including any additional reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Space for food growing: a guide</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guide is aimed both at community groups that might be looking for land to start their food growing project or trying to find new ways to encourage people to get involved in their existing scheme and at individuals who might be interested in growing their own food but are not sure whether to wait for a local authority allotment or continue their search elsewhere. The guidance can also be used by voluntary groups trying to decide what activities might suit their client base or by individuals who have yet to be convinced that food growing is really for them. The guide provides links to sources of further advice and guidance and also to more detailed information on where to go to get funding or to learn from established projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on Planning Applications were released under the auspices of the UK Statistics Authority on 27 July 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the period January to March 2012 authorities undertaking district level planning in England:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;and decided 4 per cent more residential decisions compared to the March quarter 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year ending March 2012, district level planning authorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;decided 57 per cent of major applications in 13 weeks, 71 per cent of minors and 82 per cent of others in 8 weeks. This compares to 66 per cent for majors, 75 per cent for minors and 86 per cent for others in the year ending March 2011;&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report identifies the main gaps in the literature on overheating in homes, and recommends areas where further work might be of most value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis has been carried out on behalf of Government by a consortium led by AECOM, and supported by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and University College London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the second project output; the first being a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/overheatingliterature"&gt;Literature Review&lt;/a&gt; covering whether overheating is occurring in new dwellings, in existing dwellings and whether or not retrofitting/refurbishing existing dwellings is likely to increase the risk of overheating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings and recommendations in this report are those of the consultant authors and do not necessarily represent the views or proposed policies of the Department for Communities and Local Government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
