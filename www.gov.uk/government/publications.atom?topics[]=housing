    <title>A better deal for mobile home owners</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes a number of reforms to the park homes sector, aimed at tackling a number of complaints made by residents of some mobile home site operators. These can include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking an owner’s sale of their home - without justifiable reason&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neglecting their sites and failing to make adequate repairs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;charging excessive pitch fees, breaching site rules and stopping owners from improving their homes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures are designed to ensure site operators who behave responsibly can continue to operate as they do already whilst the rogue operators are properly tackled - as well as being made to meet the cost of their negligence rather than the taxpayer picking up the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring compliance with site licence conditions by enabling the courts to impose unlimited fines on operators who do not manage their sites properly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allowing local authorities to make a reasonable charge on site operators for their licensing services, which they are currently unable to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving local authorities the power to carry out works on sites in an emergency or where the site operator has been found guilty of a breach of the licence, and charge the cost back to them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strengthening the rules around the sale of mobile homes so that unscrupulous operators cannot interfere with owners selling to a qualifying buyer who they have chosen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changing legislation to improve other residents’ rights to reflect their status as home owners by, for example, allowing them to carry out home improvements without seeking permission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Housing capital receipts: exemptions from regulations</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Guidance for local authorities applying to use receipts from the disposal of council housing assets in ways not prescribed in regulations.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of receipts arising from the disposal of housing assets (ie assets held under part 2 of the Housing Act 1985 and for which account is made in the Housing Revenue Account) is governed by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1324/made"&gt;Local Authorities (Capital Finance and Accounting) (England) Regulations 2003 (as amended.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These regulations require that, in short: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;receipts arising from Right to Buy (and similar sales may be retained to cover the cost of transacting the sales and to cover the debt on the properties sold, but a proportion of the remainder must be surrendered to central government &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;receipts arising from all other disposals may be retained in full provided they are spent on affordable housing, regeneration or the paying down of housing debt (each of which is defined in the regulations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, section 11(6) of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/26/contents"&gt;Local Government Act 2003&lt;/a&gt; (as inserted by section 174 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/contents"&gt;Localism Act 2011&lt;/a&gt;) permits the secretary of state to enter into agreements with local authorities with the effect that any requirement imposed by these regulations does not apply, or is modified in its application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enter into such an agreement it is necessary for any interested authority to make an application to the secretary of state. This guidance sets out the Department for Communities and Local Government’s policy on such exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Affordable housing starts and completions funded by the HCA and the GLA - April to September 2012-13</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Starts and completions of affordable housing for England, bringing together those funded by the HCA and those funded by the GLA.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics on affordable housing starts and completions funded by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) and the Greater London Authority (GLA) were released on Friday 16 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures show the supply of homes delivered under the accelerated land disposal programme, the 2011-15 affordable homes programme (including the affordable homes programme, empty homes, homelessness change, mortgage rescue and traveller pitch funding), the economic assets programme, firstbuy, the get Britain building programme, the kickstart housing delivery programme, the national affordable housing programme and the property and regeneration programme. Details about these programmes can be found in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/housing-statistics"&gt;HCA Housing statistics release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 1 April and 30 September 2012, there were 3,735 affordable housing starts on site delivered in England through programmes managed by the HCA and the GLA. This represents an increase of 678 per cent compared to the 480 (revised) started in the same period of the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Between 1 April and 30 September 2012, there were 11,432 affordable housing completions delivered through programmes through programmes managed by the HCA and the GLA. This represents a decrease of 11 per cent compared to the 12,778 completed in the same period in the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on the number of affordable homes delivered under the HCA affordable housing programmes is published twice a year. From April 2012, the Mayor of London has had strategic oversight of housing, regeneration and economic development in London. This means that the HCA no longer publish affordable housing starts and completions for London and this responsibility has been taken over by the GLA. DCLG combines data from the HCA and the GLA to publish six monthly affordable housing starts and completions delivered nationally under the affordable housing programmes of the HCA and GLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about the HCA affordable housing statistics, see their &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/housing-statistics"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social housing sales in England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Total social housing sales in England, including Right to Buy, Right to Acquire and Social Homebuy.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents official statistics on the number of sales of existing social housing stock in England for 2011 to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social housing sales include sales under right to buy, preserved right to buy, right to acquire, social homebuy, other outright or shared equity sales to tenants, and sales of existing stock to the private sector. The figures exclude sales through low cost home ownership schemes where these do not relate to existing social stock, i.e. sales of newly built homes for shared ownership or acquisitions of private sector homes for affordable home ownership. Intra-tenure transfers between social housing providers are also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were an estimated 9,670 total social housing sales in England in 2011-12. This is an increase of 15% on 2010-11 but continues the low level of sales seen since 2008-09. The increase was entirely due to an increase in private registered provider sales; local authority sales were virtually unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were an estimated 3,720 right to buy sales in England in 2011-12 (38% of all sales), a 1% increase from 2010-11. Most (70%) right to buy sales were of local authority properties. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average market value of a local authority property purchased through right to buy in 2011-12 was £100,040. Average capital receipts were £73,350 and the average discount was £26,690 per property. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Registered provider sales in 2011-12 included 140 properties sold through the right to acquire scheme (compared to 200 in 2010-11) and 40 through social homebuy (compared to 110 in 2010-11).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A further 3,320 sales (34% of total sales) were disposals of registered provider properties to the private sector. Other shared equity and outright sales of existing stock accounted for the remaining sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics relate to right to buy sales by local authorities and registered providers. The statistics include sales under the right to buy and preserved right to buy schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local authorities sold an estimated 444 dwellings under the right to buy scheme in 2012-13 quarter 1. In this quarter local authorities received £24 million from right to buy sales, while 14 dwellings were started on site or acquired.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities sold an estimated 1,043 dwellings under the right to buy scheme in 2012-13 quarter 2. In this quarter local authorities received £62 million from right to buy sales, while 234 dwellings were started on site or acquired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics relate only to sales by local authorities under the right to buy scheme, excluding sales by registered providers under preserved right to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Changes to the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness Regulations</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Letter to local housing authorities about the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness Regulations which came into force on 8 November 2012.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2588/made"&gt;The Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2012&lt;/a&gt; came into force on 8 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulations amend &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1294/contents/made"&gt;The Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) Regulations 2006&lt;/a&gt; in order to maintain the Government’s policy on eligibility for social hog and homelessness assistance in relation to non European Economic Area nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; is making these amendments following a ruling in the Court of Justice of the European Union in the case of Zambrano (C-34/09).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department wrote to chief housing officers about the new regulations on 17 October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A total of 57,950 gross additional affordable homes were supplied in England in 2011-12. This is a decrease of 4% on the 60,430 (revised) affordable homes supplied in 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;37,540 new affordable homes were provided for social rent in 2011-12, a decrease of 3% on 2010-11. A further 930 new affordable homes were provided for affordable rent in 2011-12, the first year for which this scheme has run.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;19,490 homes were provided through intermediate housing schemes, including shared ownership and shared equity, down by 10% on 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were 52,880 new build affordable homes provided in 2011-12, representing 91% of all affordable homes provided in 2011-12 compared to 88% of total supply in 2010-11. This was the highest percentage reported since before 1991-92.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12, 88% of affordable homes were in receipt of funding through the Homes and Communities Agency (excluding homes delivered under Section 106 without grant), a reduction from 92% in 2010-11. Around 92% of these were new build homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note: These statistics were assessed by the United Kingdom Statistics Authority in June 2011 (Report 117). We have addressed the requirements relating to these statistics to the satisfaction of the UK Statistics Authority and they are now accredited as National Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Dealing with squatters in your home</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Guidance for property owners about the new criminal offence of squatting and about how to regain possession of their properties.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1 September 2012, a person squatting in a residential building is committing a crime. The offence covers squatting in all residential buildings. It protects homeowners and lawful occupiers who discover squatters have occupied their homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance is jointly produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Ministry of Justice. It is aimed at informing property owners about the new offence and the procedures for regaining possession of their properties from squatters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It updates the version published on 21 March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Homelessness prevention and relief: England 2011 to 2012</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an official statistics release on homelessness prevention and relief in England that took place outside the homelessness statutory framework in 2011 to 2012. This is the 4th year for which figures on homelessness prevention and relief have been published by the Department for Communities and Local Government under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the previous three releases were badged as ‘experimental’ official statistics in recognition that this is a relatively new data series, DCLG statisticians judge that the response rates and the quality of the figures received for 2011-12 have now improved enough for the ‘experimental’ label to now be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 2011-12, a total of 199,000 cases of homelessness prevention or relief are estimated to have taken place outside the statutory homelessness framework in England. Of these cases, 174,800 (88 per cent) were preventions and 24,200 (12 per cent) were cases of relief&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the total number of cases of homelessness prevention or relief increased by 5 per cent when compared to 2010-11. This is due to prevention cases increasing by 7 per cent, whilst cases of relief decreased by 2 per cent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in 2011-12, 57 per cent of cases of homelessness prevention and relief involved the household being assisted to obtain alternative accommodation. The remaining 43 per cent involved the cases being assisted to remain in their existing home. This has not changed since 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the most common action taken to prevent or relieve homelessness was the use of landlord incentive schemes to secure private rented sector accommodation. In 2011-12, 27,600 cases (14 per cent) were assisted in obtaining alternative accommodation this way, though this was a decrease of 10 per cent compared to 2010-11&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the amount of homelessness prevention and relief activity varied across the regions. The North East had the highest rate of cases of prevention and relief with 11.8 cases per 1,000 households. The West Midlands (11.7 cases per 1,000 households), Yorkshire and the Humber (11.5) and the East Midlands (10.8) also had high rates of prevention and relief. The East of England, with 6.8 cases per 1,000 households, had the lowest rate.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seasonally adjusted house building starts in England stood at 21,540 in the June quarter 2012. This is 10 per cent lower than in the March quarter 2012&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;completions (seasonally adjusted) also fell, down 6 per cent to 29,470 in the June quarter 2012&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;private enterprise housing starts (seasonally adjusted) were 7 per cent lower in the June quarter 2012 than the previous quarter, whilst starts by housing associations were 23 per cent lower&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;seasonally adjusted private enterprise completions fell by 5 per cent and housing association completions fell by 11 per cent from the previous quarter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;seasonally adjusted starts are now 27 per cent above the trough in the March quarter 2009 but 54 percent below the December quarter 2005 peak. Completions are 39 per cent below their March quarter 2007 peak&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;annual housing starts totalled 98,670 in the 12 months to June 2012, down by 10 per cent compared with the year before. Annual housing completions in England reached 118,330 in the 12 months to June 2012, an increase of 8 per cent compared with the previous 12 months&lt;/li&gt;
