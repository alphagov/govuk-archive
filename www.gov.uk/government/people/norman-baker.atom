    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank-you ladies and gentlemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great pleasure to join you today for this important conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re here to talk about ‘transparency’ – one of those modern buzzwords that we hear all the time in politics, business, and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by giving you my own perspective on transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transparency-for-the-customer"&gt;Transparency for the customer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I speak as a rail minister…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a regular user of the rail network…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a Liberal Democrat…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have campaigned for transparency ever since I was first elected in 1997.  The first bill I presented to Parliament was on the release of public records and I was the first person to submit a &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; request of MPs’ expenses, with all the ramifications that led to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you won’t be surprised that I’m a passionate believer in transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s something we need to see more of from every powerful institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud of the progress we have made to open up government and the wider public sector in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I will say this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about building the respect, trust and confidence of the people who use and fund the network - passengers, freight customers, and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true measure of transparency comes not from those who claim to practise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes from those on the outside who stand to benefit from it… the passengers and the public who provide the patronage and pounds sterling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be a shared agenda, while we have made big strides over the past few years, we still have some way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/government/publications/report-of-the-laidlaw-inquiry"&gt;Laidlaw report&lt;/a&gt; last week made a specific criticism of the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; when it said the department wasn’t transparent enough with bidders about the franchise process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are correcting that and we will be more transparent in future, but you have to do your bit as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rail-transparency"&gt;Rail transparency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me put rail transparency in some sort of perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;Open Public Services White Paper&lt;/a&gt; last year set the scene for the government’s transparency agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was followed this year by another White Paper and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/dft-open-data-strategy"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Open Data Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamental to these programmes are public services which are responsive to the people they serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations which can be held to account by citizens and elected representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open data is crucial to this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our rail reform programme highlighted 3 specific areas for transparency: rail finances; network performance and open access to information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so much has already been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together we are now publishing a great deal of performance data, from right time and passenger complaints to statistics on overcrowding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; has set out the costs of supporting the network by &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt;; subsidies per mile; and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network Rail has separated accounts by route. And new information about &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt; finances will be published next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And passengers have much better access to timetables and real time service information than they had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, data produced by Network Rail is allowing developers to generate phone and computer apps for passengers on how trains are running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a private-sector, not-for-dividend, company limited by guarantee, Network Rail is not currently subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Nonetheless, as a regulated provider of public services, in receipt of public subsidy, the company wisely recognises the demand for more of its information and data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, it began a programme to publish more of its information and data on its website, including an on-line form allowing members of the public to make suggestions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government welcomes these steps, which will improve the organisation’s accountability to passengers and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I welcome the excellent news from the last &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dft-transport-sector-transparency-board"&gt;Transport Transparency Board&lt;/a&gt; that the fares database will be released as open data during the first quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="olympics"&gt;Olympics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these transparency measures are designed for long-term dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Olympic Games earlier this year set the industry a more immediate challenge around the provision of transport data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key part of the programme was to provide businesses and the public with information about the transport network, and which stations were likely to be busiest at different times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Transport for London"&gt;TfL&lt;/abbr&gt;, Network Rail, &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt; and train operators worked with organisers to produce ‘hotspot’ data which was published on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.getaheadofthegames.com/"&gt;Get Ahead of the Games&lt;/a&gt; website – together with journey planners and interactive tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site had over 16 million page views and 4 million unique users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it played a key role in what was an enormously successful operation to manage transport demand during the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experience was invaluable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It showed just what can be achieved by planning ahead and communicating information to users of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was also a lesson in how to deliver data effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is of little use if it’s too complicated or inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has to be carefully managed, targeted and presented to meet the needs and expectations of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s precisely what was achieved by the team who delivered the Olympics transport plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fares-and-ticketing"&gt;Fares and ticketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the government re-shuffle back in September, the new &lt;a href="/government/people/patrick-mcloughlin"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; asked me to lead the &lt;a href="/government/consultations/rail-fares-and-ticketing-review"&gt;fares and ticketing review&lt;/a&gt; in the department.  You will appreciate that this is a hugely labyrinthine process.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I am concerned, transparency is key to the review.  I want an outcome where the passenger can easily access the right information to enable them to buy the right ticket for their journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while many do, many don’t.  Indeed, there appears to be some confusion even at the highest levels, judging by &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;’s comments in the metro last week blaming the government for the rise in unregulated fares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now turn to the issue of right-time information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="right-time"&gt;Right-time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will know, I have been pushing for the release of right-time – the number of trains arriving within 59 seconds of the advertised arrival time - for some time now, actually for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first raised this formally at the Performance Delivery Group which I chair on 20 July 2011 and I am to be honest disappointed that it has taken this long to get where we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear that it is not the intention of the government to replace &lt;abbr title="Public Performance Measure"&gt;PPM&lt;/abbr&gt; with right-time for performance benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may together conclude that the correct benchmark is whether a long-distance service arrives within 9 minutes and 59 seconds, but it is close to dishonest to suggest that a train arriving 9 minutes and 59 seconds after its stated arrival time is on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public are entitled to know the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I recognise, and indeed sympathise, that there is a concern within the industry that if this information is published, you will be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I observe at this point that ScotRail recently released its right-time data and the world has not ended north of the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that releasing information to the public can be uncomfortable – just look at the hundreds of &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; requests we have to deal with in the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; each month.  But actually the free availability of information is a key tool to driving up performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry will be releasing right-time data by &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt; on 20 December, even if the timing means it won’t be getting much coverage, I will be making a lot of noise about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be making comments saying what a good showing this is from the industry.  In terms of both performance and transparency we’re ahead of our European competitors so this staging post is welcome, but we need to go further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commuter on the 6:40 from Aylesbury, the student on the 8:32 to Brighton and the occasional traveller on the 10:15 to Nuneaton have a right to know whether their train is regularly on time or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look fwd to these passengers having the data they need when we make a further right-time release in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This information is held by the ORR and, as such, it is available under the &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; laws.  It is in my view far better for the industry to be on the front-foot with this rather than have it extracted by someone hostile to the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-transport-sectors"&gt;Other transport sectors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony is that the rail industry is doing pretty well in punctuality.  Both in comparisons with other countries, and in this country when compared with other modes.  Why hide your light under a bushel as if there is a guilty secret?  Those of you who have been to my office will have heard me reference the poster in my office which champions the railway against the clogged road network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am determined the same level of transparency should apply to other transport sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Highways Agency, for example, has released a wide range of statistics about roadworks and real-time traffic conditions, and over 80% local authorities have opened up their roadwork data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working with the Agency to improve reliability data for the motorway network, and hope to publish information on the wider road network next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus industry has released its national database of services across Britain, with access to real time information from all 350,000 bus stops… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple but enormously effective improvement for passengers, particularly during these winter months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the aviation industry is also embracing transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is already publishing monthly punctuality data by route and airline for 10 UK airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our Civil Aviation Bill will enshrine further powers to collect and publish data to help the consumer. Specifically, it will require the industry to provide information that the CAA considers appropriate to help passengers understand and compare different services and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Bill has completed its passage through Parliament and now awaits Royal Assent.  We anticipate that this will be before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s more the aviation industry could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, we would like the airlines to provide clearer information about the ticket price their customers should expect to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in reality, you have a good story to tell.  Some of you, however, are mindlessly trying to cover it up.  This is 1950s thinking and frankly, it won’t wash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me conclude by first of all recognising and congratulating the industry for the strides it has made towards greater transparency in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an industry that received £3 billion of public subsidy in 2010/11, the public has a right to clearer and more open information on costs, performance and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is what you are delivering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also urge you – wherever possible – to press ahead with further transparency in the future so it becomes embedded in the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I believe that whatever helps the passenger will ultimately help the railway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Cash boost to get England cycling</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cities, towns and villages across England are set to benefit from an extra £20 million for cycle infrastructure.  The new funding was announced today by Transport Minister Norman Baker, at a conference in Leicester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new funding will help people take to two wheels.  Projects could include better cycle facilities at railway stations, improved cycle links, or projects to improve the layout of road junctions to make them more cycle-friendly. Previous investment has seen some great projects making a real difference in communities, including better cycle routes from residential areas to schools to encourage the next generation of cyclists to cycle more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s conference in Leicester, attended by Public Health Minister Anna Soubry and Norman Baker, explores how councils’ health and transport officials can work better together to deliver better options for cycling and walking in their local areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cycling is great for your health, the economy, and for the environment so we are determined to make it easier for people to cycle whether for leisure, getting to the shops or as part of their commute to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Following the success of the Olympics, there is a huge appetite for more cycling provision from the travelling public and we need to capitalise on this enthusiasm at local and national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That is why we are investing £20 million in cycling infrastructure and getting councils to bring an end to silo working in their offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Health Minister Anna Soubry said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Being active helps us stay healthy and protects against life threatening conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cycling is a great way for adults to get their recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week and this funding will help encourage more people to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £20 million announced today is in addition to £30 million already announced for similar projects this year which drew in an additional £15 million in matched funding from local sources.  The projects to be funded will be announced later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/additional-funding-for-cycling-infrastructure"&gt;written statement&lt;/a&gt; was laid in Parliament this morning &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence today also published new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nice.org.uk/"&gt;guidance on public health for local authorities&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Additional funding for cycling infrastructure</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coalition Government has today made available an additional £20m for our existing infrastructure projects to support cycling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding will increase the total available for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Community Linking Places Fund (in addition to the £15m announced on 7 February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improving cycle safety at junctions (in addition to the £15m announced on 26 June 2012)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Community Linking Places Fund is primarily for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure, facilities and links. This includes improving access to the rail network by bicycle. In addition the fund aims to support jobs, enhance access to employment and encourage greater use of more environmentally friendly transport.   Projects currently being supported were announced on 6 March 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment in junctions - for use by English local authorities outside London - will help to tackle accident hotspots where cyclists have been killed or seriously injured, or are deemed to be at greater risk.  Local authorities are currently submitting bids for funding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand from local authorities, Sustrans and train operating companies, who are delivering the infrastructure, has been high.  An increase of £20m to the total funding available will allow the Government to support more high quality proposals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of the projects to be supported under the additional funding will be published early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Transport Scotland high speed rail summit</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2gEnT-LreI&amp;amp;feature=share&amp;amp;list=UU8mgf88hO4bbrfta9bcgZuA"&gt;Transport Scotland high speed rail summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transcript"&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello and thank you for the opportunity to put on record coalition government’s commitment to high speed rail, and its determination that all parts of our country, including of course Scotland, should benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing demand for inter-city rail travel is putting increasing pressure on existing infrastructure. Without planning for additional capacity, passengers face the prospect of increasingly crowded and more unreliable services. To be clear, the primary, though not the only, justification for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a clear need for extra capacity north to south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans for a high speed rail network from London to the West Midlands and on to Leeds and Manchester will be the backbone of a new transport system for the 21st century.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2026, Phase 1 of High Speed 2 will link London and Birmingham. Comfortable trains travelling at 225 miles per hour will cut the journey time to just 45 minutes, compared to the 84 minutes it currently takes. Importantly for Scotland, the first phase of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will provide connections to the existing network at Birmingham, and also link &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; to &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt;, opening up the opportunities for through trains to run from Scotland to Paris and Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completion of the Y network to Leeds and Manchester will further spread the benefits of high speed rail across the country, increasing capacity and enhancing connectivity all the way to Scotland by relieving pressure on the most congested southern end of the line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition agreement makes it clear that our ultimate goal is a genuinely national network, with high speed services from London to the Midlands and the north, including Scotland. We see phases one and two of the High Speed 2 project as the best way to make progress towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport ministerial team is very much engaged in the question of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; as it affects and, indeed, benefits Scotland. I visited Glasgow last year, the former Secretary of State went in March this year, and the current Secretary of State intends to visit later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last month we announced the launch of a study on ways to get fast journeys further north and to Scotland, making sure that the north-east benefits too. The aim is to fully understand and articulate transport needs in Scotland and the north of England, setting out the remit for any future work, using completion of the ‘Y’ network as a starting point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study won’t start with any preconceptions but will be open to all options that offer good value for money to the taxpayer. This may include a full high speed solution, upgrades to existing infrastructure, or a combination of the two.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands today the network is expected to deliver up to £50 billion of business benefits alone and that will be felt very much in Scotland and the north of England as well as the South. The claim by some opponents of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; that better and faster transport links between north and south will see economic activity pulled into London and away from the UK’s other great cities is defeatist and misguided, and out of line with public opinion. The further north you go, the louder are the voices in support of high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing Edinburgh and Glasgow closer to London as well as the cities of the midlands and the north of England will undoubtedly boost growth across all of our major conurbations. That confidence is based on the evidence from our European neighbours, who began their high speed rail journey a generation before we had even started arguing about our first 67 mile stretch of high speed track from the channel tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With passengers enjoying faster journeys, there has been more extensive modal shift between rail and air as the train becomes the mode of choice for more travellers. High speed rail is already greener than flying and the gap between the two modes will widen as we make progress in decarbonising the sources of our electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will benefit every type of traveller, not just on the new network, but on existing lines too, freeing up more space and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, not only will high speed rail help boost the Scottish economy and support thousands of jobs in Scotland and throughout the UK, it gives us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the economic geography of the whole country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever way you look at it, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a national scheme in the national interest driven by a national government. Realising the full benefits of high speed rail for Scotland is crucial to the economic wellbeing of the whole country, and I can assure you we will continue to work very closely with our partners in Scotland to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Green light for Weston transport improvements</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on a new package of public transport and road improvement measures in Weston-super-Mare can now start after receiving final approval from Local Transport Minister Norman Baker today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme will support economic growth in Weston-super-Mare and reduce congestion in the town centre. The work will also improve links between local roads and the M5 motorway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improvements to increase capacity of the M5 Junction 21&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new link road for buses to access Worle railway station&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bus priority measures at junctions and bus only sections to improve bus access to the south of Worle Station, linking it with regeneration areas at Weston Airfield and Locking Parklands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new 320 space car park with a bus interchange, drop-off and cycle facilities together with improvements to the north-side car park at Worle Station&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increased capacity between the town centre and the regeneration areas through road widening and new routes for pedestrians and cyclists as well as bus priority measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a great scheme that will support employment, reduce congestion and make it easier for people using public transport in and around Weston-super-Mare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The £10.4 million we are putting into this scheme shows that the coalition government is serious about investing in the infrastructure the country and the region needs to drive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Weston package scheme was one of the schemes given funding approval last year as part of the Spending Review process.  Work is currently planned to start in March 2013 with the package scheduled to open in April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today’s announcement grants full (final) approval to the Weston package scheme enabling work to begin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The package of measures, promoted by North Somerset Council, is scheduled to open in April 2014.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Passengers to benefit from Olympic boost to services</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music lovers and sports fans travelling to gigs and games will benefit from more convenient train services under plans to make it easier for operators to offer more flexible timetables, Transport Minister Norman Baker announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes, which are being introduced after a successful trial during the London 2012 Games, will mean that on special occasions train operators will be able to adjust a small portion of the timetable to better serve passengers without seeking permission from the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Olympic Games were a massive success and proved our transport system was able to successfully carry record numbers of passengers. We helped train operators cope with the changing demand by giving them more flexibility to give passengers the services they needed.
&amp;gt;This has proved such an unqualified success that we have decided to permanently cut the red tape involved in adjusting small portions of the timetable. The changes give train companies the opportunity to ensure passengers are able to plan ahead to ensure they make it to their football matches and concerts and back home again on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Roberts, Chief Executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies (&lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;), said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is good news for passengers. Train companies have been seeking greater freedom to adapt their timetables to suit the needs of their customers and this move will be a big boost for people wanting to enjoy many special events across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes enable operators in England to adapt their timetables to cater for events in the calendar year when changes in passenger demand are expected to be significantly different – such as during sporting and cultural events or during school holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train operators will be allowed to adjust up to 30% of their timetabled services for special occasions, ensuring that more frequent passengers are still able to enjoy regular services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Transport Secretary will retain discretion over all timetable changes and the new measures and passenger benefits gained will be reviewed within the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The General Consent protocol, which enables train operators to adjust a small portion of their timetables for special events, was trialled with Southern Trains from the 17 April – 23 June 2012. This was then extended to all English train operators during the London 2012 Games.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The decision follows the success of the pilots and following consultation with Passenger Focus, London TravelWatch and &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Secretary of State is not responsible for the management of services within Scotland and Wales&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>2012 UK Bus Awards lunch speech</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you also for inviting me along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a pleasure to be here today at my third consecutive UK Bus Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one for every Transport Secretary since I became a Minister at the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I’m lucky enough to be sharing the stage with Jane (Jane Hill – BBC News).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A journalist and a newsreader, a TV anchor and a radio presenter - Jane is one of the country’s most familiar faces and familiar voices.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have it on good authority that Jane is a big fan of Radio 4’s “The Archers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drama come soap opera that seems to have been around forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters that not too many of the public would recognise in the street&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And people living in a make-believe world which critics claim bears little resemblance to everyday life in modern Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might say this all sounds a bit like the House of Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="speaking-up-for-the-bus-industry"&gt;Speaking up for the bus industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I hope I’ve not just been the consistent Ministerial face at the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; - I’ve also tried to be a consistent voice when it comes to speaking up for the bus industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve said it before and I’ll keep on saying it - Britain’s buses matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are a few familiar facts and figures that prove why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bus travel accounts for 63% of all public transport journeys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;last year in Great Britain buses clocked up 5.2 billion passenger journeys &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, as well as contributing more than £2 billion a year to the economy, the bus industry provides 124,000 direct jobs and supports an estimated 83,000 jobs through the supply chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buses also open up access to vital public services such as health and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, they provide a transport link between worker and workplace, with some two and a half million jobs accessed every day by bus, which is more than by all other forms of public transport combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, increasingly, buses are also helping to safeguard our environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, thanks to this government’s “&lt;a href="/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/background-to-the-green-bus-fund"&gt;Green Bus Fund&lt;/a&gt;” we’re seeing more and more low emission buses on our streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buses that emit around 30 per cent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than standard diesel buses and use around a third less fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And earlier this month I was pleased to announce an extra £20 million for what is now the 4th round of the Green Bus Fund, bringing the total support for this initiative to £95 million since its launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted in Greener Journey’s “Buses and Economic Growth Report” not only are buses the backbone of our public transport system, they can also boost economic growth and cut carbon by reducing congestion and replacing car journeys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="an-industry-equal-to-testing-times"&gt;An industry equal to testing times&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This then is an industry that makes a difference. But it’s also an industry that isn’t short of challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt; and concessionary travel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt; I of course recognise that the rate was cut by 20% from April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also think it’s worth remembering that the Government realised the importance of giving you plenty of time to get ready for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why we gave the bus market 18 months advance notice of the change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me say this on the issue of concessionary travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve made sure that bus operators will be reimbursed so that they are “no better and no worse off” by carrying concessionary passengers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, because, we want the processes surrounding this to be as fair as possible, we’ve also speeded up the appeals mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I know that it’s not easy for operators right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluctuating fuel prices and the backdrop of a tough economic climate make these testing times for businesses and families across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest figures show bus patronage was down 0.3% in non-metropolitan areas and while this is unwelcoming it is far from the apocalypse scene commentators were predicting. Indeed overall, bus patronage across England rose by 0.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also pleased to see that 85% of bus passengers are satisfied with their service. And even in the area of lowest satisfaction it was still 79%. I haven’t seen the latest comparable figures for satisfaction with politicians and journalists but I’m told it’s not quite that high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, these may be testing times but, once again, the industry is showing itself to be equal to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="green-light-for-better-buses"&gt;Green Light for Better Buses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I sense a mood of quiet optimism that was especially tangible at the recent 2012 Euro Bus Expo, which I was delighted to open and where I was able to speak with many in the industry.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also know that there is more to do. Now is not the time for the engine to tick over at the bus stop, we have to keep moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why earlier this year I set out my vision for buses in the &lt;a href="/government/publications/green-light-for-better-buses"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; policy document, “Green Light for Better Buses.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that this report will help provide stability in the industry by reforming subsidy, improving competition and Incentivise partnership working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its heart is a shared vision for a bus service that is reliable and flexible, efficient and innovative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One that offers competitive prices and smarter ticketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus service that gives taxpayers real value for money and passengers a travel option they want to use time and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus service that is successful and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus service that people want to use, not one they use because they have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="young-people"&gt;Young People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d argue that one of the best ways to ensure success and sustainability over the long-term is to encourage much greater bus travel among that section of the market that is literally the future of the industry - young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a challenge that cannot be side-stepped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, just this month the Youth Select Committee published its report on “Transport and Young People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That report called for the age at which young people start paying full fares to be set at 18 across England and for the introduction of a national concessionary scheme to provide a discounted bus travel card for those younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I am looking at this report very seriously and I really do want to work with operators, and also local authorities, to improve the deal for our young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as I said, this is a challenge we have to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s think about all the ways we can use bus services to help young people access employment and training opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s make bus travel easy and attractive for young people by building on initiatives like CPT’s  (Confederation of Passenger Transport) excellent “Bus for Us” interactive website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted that, since I launched it, over 80 of the UK’s bus operators are already signed up to “Bus for Us”  - equivalent to 85% of the bus market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to see all operators on board in the near future. There’s room on top for the rest. My message to the remaining 15% is “don’t miss the bus”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also be innovative about the fare deals and the discounts on offer to young people…and the great work done by Trent Barton in this area shows it can be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s deliver some consistency too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, TCA- led youth concessions are offered in 28 TCAs outside London, and a commercial youth concession is available in 80 TCAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are some good things going on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why is it that in some places there are no concessions at all? And how can it be that in one area a 16 year old might get free bus travel while, in another, a 14-year old pays full adult fare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s come together and work together to support our young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, let’s win over the next generation of bus passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pay-tribute-to-all-the-nominees"&gt;Pay tribute to all the nominees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me return to the reason why we are all here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said earlier that I’m proud to be the bus champion in government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m also just as proud of the people and organisations working in the bus industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, this afternoon, we rightly take the time to recognise some of the brightest and the best in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty two categories in this year’s awards: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals and teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities and  operators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cities and shires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small projects and big projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All making today’s shortlist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all with something in common….excellence and achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, these awards show that the hallmarks of your industry are innovation, professionalism and sheer hard work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also show that, at its heart, your industry is all about people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can talk about investment. And we can debate the pros and cons of one policy versus another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, when push comes to shove, it’s the people in the bus industry who make the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the difference because they understand the needs of the travelling public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the difference because they want to provide a first class service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the difference by delivering real improvements on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s who, and what, we are honouring today….and so I pay tribute to all of this year’s nominees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. They do say that making a speech is a bit like having a fight – any fool can start one, the real skill is knowing when and how to end it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I know you’re keen to get on with handing out those awards, so you’ll be pleased to hear that the “when” has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for “how to end it” it simply remains for me to thank you for your hospitality, to thank you for listening and to wish all those waiting to hear if they’ve won the very best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you and hopefully I’ll see you all next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Boxing Day boost for bargain-hungry passengers</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bargain hunters will find it easier to get to the sales this year under plans to boost Boxing Day rail services, Transport Minister Norman Baker announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra rail services – which will make it easier for shoppers to access retail hubs in central London, Stratford and Kent – are being provided thanks to an agreement between the Department for Transport, Southeastern, and &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt; Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have devised a unique agreement to enable Southeastern and &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt; to make it easier for their passengers to get to the sales following Christmas, which will provide more services at no cost to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Southeastern ran some very successful services on High Speed 1 during the Olympics and the train operator has shown there is sufficient demand for these services so we were happy to consider allowing them to adjust their timetables. This is an excellent example of the government, infrastructure owners and train operators working innovatively together to improve services for passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeastern’s managing director, Charles Horton said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re really pleased to offer this trial Boxing Day service for our passengers thanks to the collaboration with &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt; and the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;. Our high speed Javelin service will transport people from Ashford to St Pancras International in just 37 minutes, and 19 minutes from Ebbsfleet. We’re also pleased to offer free parking at these 2 stations for Boxing Day so everyone has a little bit extra to spend in the sales!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Ruse, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt; Ltd, the company that owns High Speed 1 said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Demand for high speed rail travel is rising all the time and this welcome example of teamwork on the railways means we can offer high speed rail customers a service that will prove hugely popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The half hourly service will run between Ashford International, Ebbsfleet International, Stratford International and St Pancras International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeastern and &lt;abbr title="High Speed 1"&gt;HS1&lt;/abbr&gt; Ltd ran a special timetable through the Olympics and Paralympics with extra high speed services to carry spectators to and from Stratford International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timetables and ticket information can be viewed online at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/"&gt;nationalrail.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evesham to benefit from new £8.2 million bridge</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work to replace the Abbey Bridge over the River Avon in Evesham can now start after the proposals received final approval from Local Transport Minister Norman Baker today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bridge and viaduct need to be replaced as they are in poor condition and the current structures are already subject to a 7.5 tonne weight restriction. If the structures are not replaced then even lower restrictions would be needed in the near future along with the possibility of full closure to all traffic soon after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When completed, the new bridge will allow the current weight limit to be removed bringing the bridge up to current national standards and allowing it to be used by HGVs, coaches and buses. The replacement bridge will improve access to Evesham town centre from the south for local residents and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excellent scheme will restore the full capacity of this important route and provide a boost to the local economy by ensuring that access to the town centre for bus passengers and lorries is maintained.
&amp;gt;The £5.6 million we are putting into this project shows that the Coalition Government is serious about investing in the infrastructure the country needs to drive economic growth both locally and nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Abbey Bridge replacement scheme was one of the schemes given funding approval last year as part of the Spending Review process.  Work can now start on construction with the new bridge scheduled to open in December 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today’s announcement grants Full (final) Approval to the Abbey Bridge replacement scheme enabling work to begin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The scheme, promoted Worcestershire County Council, is scheduled to open in December 2013. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Department will provide a maximum of £5.59 million towards the full scheme cost of £8.2 million.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transcript"&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for inviting me to talk to your forum today. It seems fitting that I should be with you virtually to discuss our collective goals of creating growth whilst cutting carbon at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome the development of the Suffolk Sustainable Transport Forum and the involvement of Hutchison Ports UK, BT and Suffolk County Council. This is a great example of joint working, both across business sectors and also between business and local government. I also understand that the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership is also working across the private and public sector on their Green Economy Pathfinder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low carbon transport plays a key role in the wider drive towards sustainable economic growth, this is as true on the local level as it is on the national and international level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we allocated a new £600 million Local Sustainable Transport funding for local projects which create growth and cut carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will be aware, Suffolk received £5 million for their Lowestoft Local Links project. This package includes improved pedestrian and cycle infrastructure, increased bus services, improvements to transport interchange hubs, enhanced travel planning provisions, and more. I was pleased to visit Lowestoft this time last year and get a sense of how this will be transforming access to and around the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also investing more widely in green public transport, for example through our national programme of rail electrification or the £30 million Green Bus Fund. Each year, every low-carbon bus outside London saves around 22 tonnes of CO2 compared with its diesel equivalent. Anglian Bus Ltd in Suffolk has been awarded £624,000 to fund 13 low carbon buses, and I look forward to seeing these roll out of the garages and on to the roads, they offer a more comfortable, more reliable and much greener experience for bus passengers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses have been closely involved in the planning and delivery of Local Sustainable Transport projects in Suffolk, and indeed across the 96 projects in 77 authorities that are going ahead because of the Fund.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses are doing this because they realise the benefits of an integrated transport system that allows easy access to workplaces; because of the reduced absenteeism that results from employees choosing a more active lifestyle; and because of the transformation of the local urban and rural environments that can result from an increased uptake of sustainable modes of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also showing support by embracing alternatives to travel in their day-to-day office environments. Endorsing the use of technology, such as video speeches and teleconferencing, and supporting greater uptake of flexible working amongst staff can bring about an array of benefits. Reducing business flights and consolidating office space can lead to notable cost savings. And both research and experience have shown that employee productivity and wellbeing can be improved when we take a more flexible approach to the working day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Olympics proved a challenge and opportunity in this regard. Businesses and government understood that transport would be much busier than usual and that change was necessary. So employees came in to work and left for home earlier to escape the rush hour, they hopped on their bikes rather than hopping on the tube to escape the underground, or they stayed home and logged on rather than getting behind the wheel of a car, escaping the office altogether. The result was not just one of the most successful Games in history, but also one where transport was universally praised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the department is also investing more widely in transport infrastructure in the region, for example through the £22 million transport package for Ipswich. This is an innovative and exciting programme of work that will see Ipswich town centre become a thriving sustainable transport hub, and has the potential to transform the way people travel in and around Ipswich. Indeed, residents are already benefiting from new traffic management measures and cycle and pedestrian facilities, facilitating access to Suffolk College.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about providing policies and funding for transport. We also need to invest in relationships. And that is why I  support fora like this which discuss common challenges, build partnerships,  share best practice and generate solutions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thank you for inviting me, and good luck with your work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
