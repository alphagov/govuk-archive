    <title>Skills Minister unveils new investment in skills in key industries</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;6 Jun 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GIF was set up to help employers overcome barriers to growth within their sectors and industries. So far the government has committed over £15 million to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost innovation and productivity &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;enable industries to set new professional standards &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;support new or extended national skills academies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="support-for-nuclear-skills"&gt;Support for nuclear skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nuclear.nsacademy.co.uk/"&gt;National Skills Academy (NSA) for Nuclear Manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; will receive government investment of more than £920,000. This will enable the Academy expand its activities into nuclear manufacturing to help UK manufacturers take advantage of the opportunities offered by the new nuclear build programme. It will also collaborate with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.semta.org.uk/"&gt;Sector Skills Council for Science, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies (SEMTA)&lt;/a&gt; and the Sheffield-based &lt;a rel="external" href="http://namrc.co.uk/"&gt;Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre&lt;/a&gt; to create a focal point to boost companies’ capability to develop skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within its first three years the expansion aims to deliver a more skilled workforce, with an increase of 3,500 learners taking up programmes, including more than 500 apprenticeships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="support-for-creative-and-cultural-skills"&gt;Support for creative and cultural skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nsa-ccskills.co.uk/"&gt;National Skills Academy for Creative and Cultural&lt;/a&gt; will receive around £1.5 million. This will enable it to expand and open up opportunities for more than 1,200 new apprenticeships and craft training for young people across the jewellery, design and cultural heritage sectors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSA Creative and Cultural also plans to reach around 1.2 million young people through their careers information, advice and guidance material over the next 5 years. It will work with a number of leading organisations and employers, for example the Goldsmiths’ Company, Holts Academy and the British Jewellers’ Association. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister John Hayes said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is businesses themselves that are best-placed to identify the skills they need to drive growth. This investment is very good news for the UK nuclear and creative industries and will help them to overcome the skills gaps that stand in the way of them meeting their full potential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The new centre for excellence for nuclear manufacturing will increase the number of opportunities for technicians and skilled workers and ensure that UK firms can source the skills they need to grow their market share in an expanding market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The National Skills Academy for Creative and Cultural has already demonstrated its success in working with more than 200 employers in the theatre and live entertainment business. I am delighted that investment will allow them to increase opportunities in the design, cultural heritage and jewellery sectors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both nuclear manufacturing and for creative and cultural, government funding will be matched by business and delivered over three years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New National Careers Service launched</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Hayes also hosted a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/topstories/2012/Apr/Ask%20John%20Hayes%20-%20Tweet%20your%20skills%20and%20careers%20questions"&gt;Twitter chat at 10.30am this morning&lt;/a&gt;, answering questions on the new service. Follow the conversation using #askhayes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="national-careers-service"&gt;National Careers Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining face to face to face local advice with a new interactive website, the new &lt;a rel="external" href="https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx"&gt;National Careers Service&lt;/a&gt; will: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide information and advice for approximately 370,000 young people through the use of the helpline and website. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offer face to face advice to 700,000 adults each year in a range of locations in local communities. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide detailed sector by sector labour market information so people can discover which industries are growing in their area. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide tools such as a CV builder and a Skills Health Check on the website to help people identify their skills strengths and gaps. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow people to open a Lifelong Learning Account, which gives them clear information and advice on skills, careers and financial support in a single, personalised online space. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Hayes said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The National Careers Service, universally available to people at all stages of their careers, has the very best interactive tools on its website and the highest-quality advisers, committed to the noble cause of helping others fulfil their aspirations.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Making available the right advice at the right time and in the right places is to strike a blow for social mobility, social cohesion and social justice - a society that encourages people from wherever they start to journey to the destination of their dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model turned Chef, Lorraine Pascale is an Ambassador for the service. Speaking from the launch she said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After modelling, choosing my next career move was a big decision. I knew I wanted to find something that I was really passionate about, but I tried courses in hypnotherapy, auto repair and interior design before I found the thing that really makes me tick: cooking.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having independent careers advice can really help you find the thing you want to do. I’d encourage everyone to make the most of the National Careers Service to find out how to take their career forward, and realise their ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her view was echoed by Record Producer Pete Waterman. He said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know from my own experience that it’s never too late to learn a new skill.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I learnt to read and write much later in life than many people, but this opened up a whole new world for me.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s one of the reasons why I’m so passionate about helping people to get the skills they need to fulfil their ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Better standards for Apprenticeships</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister John Hayes has announced that Apprenticeships will last for a minimum of 12 months, guaranteeing improvements in training and workplace learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new standards will come into force for all age groups from August 2012, subject to consultation with providers and employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those aged 19 and over, apprenticeships will last between one to four years unless prior learning or attainment has been undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the new measures, Mr Hayes said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The momentum we have created by building the apprenticeship brand has brought about unprecedented success for the apprenticeship programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The majority of apprenticeships are the gold standard in vocational training. They boost individuals’ life chances and build the skills that drive growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They also provide a great return on public money. This has been independently recognised with the National Audit Office finding that apprenticeships generating £18 for the economy for every £1 spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we must be relentless in our drive to ensure all apprenticeships are as good as the best, to identify and root out any instances of poor quality provision, and to raise the bar on standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are taking strong and decisive action to tackle short duration so all apprentices receive high quality training and workplace learning setting them on the road to a long, rewarding career.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="grants-for-small-businesses-employing-their-first-apprentice"&gt;Grants for Small Businesses Employing Their First Apprentice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Monday 2 April small businesses (employing less than 250 employees) &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/News-Media/Latest-News/Article135.aspx"&gt;will be able to apply for a grant, up to a value of £1,500,&lt;/a&gt; when they recruit their first apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/"&gt;National Apprenticeship Service &lt;/a&gt;(NAS) is offering up to 40,000 Apprenticeship Grants to businesses who take on an apprentice aged 16 to 24 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those businesses interested in employing their first apprentice can contact one of the quality assured training providers or colleges approved to deliver Apprenticeship training by visiting the National Apprenticeship Service, or if they are ready to recruit, can call 08000 150 600 to speak to a NAS Apprenticeship Adviser.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Banks boost UK jobs with new apprenticeships</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcements were made at a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.newsroom.hsbc.co.uk/articles/apprenticeship_week_-_hsbc_hos"&gt;financial services sector roundtable, held at HSBC&lt;/a&gt; in Canary Wharf, as part of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/topstories/2012/Feb/apprenticeships-week-2012"&gt;National Apprenticeship Week&lt;/a&gt;. The focus was on the creation of new apprenticeship routes into employment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks taking part include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barclays - 1000 new apprenticeships across England and Wales with a major programme in April.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HSBC - an extra 688 apprentices bringing the total number of employees within its apprenticeship scheme to 1,000 by the end of 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Santander to launch an apprenticeship scheme that will see up to 50 people offered places at the bank. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the event, Skills Minister John Hayes said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that these banks are investing in apprenticeships which will help them secure the high-quality skills they need to create economic growth and provide new pathways to excellence for the brightest and best young people.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Creating a highly skilled workforce that can take on the best in the world means seeing apprenticeships as an access route to the professions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building Engagement, Building Futures</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//policies/further-education-skills/youth-participation"&gt;Building Engagement, Building Futures&lt;/a&gt; sets out the Government’s strategy to improve the opportunities for young people so they gain the skills they need to secure an Apprenticeship or employment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes radical reforms to schools, vocational education, skills and welfare provision, and has five priorities for action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raising attainment in school so that young people have the skills to compete in the global economy. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping local partners provide services that support all young people, putting us on track to achieve full participation for 16-17 year olds by 2015. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encouraging employers to offer more high quality Apprenticeships and work experience places. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring that work pays and giving young people the personalised support they need to find it, through Universal Credit, the Work Programme and the Get Britain Working measures. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Putting in place a new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/1-billion-package-tackle-youth-unemployment"&gt;Youth Contract &lt;/a&gt;worth almost £1 billion over the next three years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister John Hayes, said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re taking action to get our young people into education, training and work, helping them get on the path to a fulfilling life, providing the right advice and guidance through a new National Careers Service and restoring a sense of responsibility and purposeful pride in our communities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having built the largest apprenticeships programme our country has ever seen we are now incentivising employers to offer more high-quality apprenticeships. We are also aligning welfare and skills reforms to better support young people without basic skills get up to speed and progress on to jobs and apprenticeships.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building Engagement, Building Futures has been published jointly by &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.education.gov.uk/a00200853/building-engagement-building-futures"&gt;DfE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://dwp.gov.uk/publications/policy-publications/building-engagement.shtml"&gt;DWP&lt;/a&gt; - more detail on those Department’s policies as outlined in the strategy can be found on those websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Participation Strategy follows the recent publication by BIS of key reforms to Further Education in &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//Consultations/fe-and-skills-new-challenges-new-chances"&gt;New Challenges, New Chances&lt;/a&gt; on 1 December 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="priorities-for-action"&gt;Priorities for action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//policies/growth"&gt;Plan for Growth&lt;/a&gt;, the Chancellor set out how the Government will create the conditions for economic growth and recovery. Building Engagement, Building Futures sets out the Government’s offer for young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the priorities for action, the Government is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing £4.5 million over the next two years to give more 16-19 year olds access to work experience. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encouraging employers to take on an 18-24 year-old from the Work Programme by making available 160,000 job subsidies worth up to £2,275 for each business. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reforming the Apprenticeships programme and, as part of the Youth Contract, ensuring funding for at least 40,000 incentive payments for small firms to take on 18-24 year old apprentices. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing an extra 250,000 work experience places over the next three years for young unemployed people across the UK as part of the Youth Contract. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Funding charities and businesses to help the most disengaged 16-17 year olds get skills and jobs. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transforming vocational education following Professor Wolf’s review, with new 16-19 programmes of study, including meaningful work-experience and a focus on English and maths. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Joining up the welfare and skills systems. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launching a National Careers Service in April 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;
