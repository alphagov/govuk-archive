    <title>Statutory consultee performance and award of costs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes to amend guidance in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/costs-awards-in-appeals-and-other-planning-proceedings-circular-03-2009"&gt;Circular 03/09: Costs Awards in Appeals and Other Planning Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; in relation to statutory consultees and their advice at appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also announced clarifications to the guidance in relation to local councils and their development plan, and in relation to ensuring evidence submitted at appeal is manifestly accurate and truthful. The government is also requiring the 5 main statutory bodies to report on, and be accountable for their performance on dealing with planning applications as part of their individual Improvement Plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A summary of responses was published on 18 December 2012. The report above summarises the key issues raised and provides a revised addendum to circular 03/09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Building regulations: access statements, security, changing places toilets and regulation 7</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation paper sets out the detailed proposals on parts A, B, C, K, M and N, access statements, security, changing places toilet and regulation 7, and is section 1 of 4, relating to the 2012 building regulations consultation exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 1 provides an overview of the consultation package as a whole as well as proposals on a number of areas including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replacing the currently referenced standards in part A (structure) with the new British Standards based on Eurocodes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;aligning the existing guidance in Approved Document C (site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture) with the most up-to-date radon maps to ensure the safety provisions are targeted appropriately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clarifying the guidance on access statements in Approved Document M (access to and use of buildings)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalising the guidance supporting parts M, K and N (access, protection from falling, collision and impact and glazing respectively) to remove unnecessary costs on business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making minor changes to the technical guidance in Approved Document B (fire safety) to resolve practical problems in the application of requirement B2 (internal fire spread (linings))&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting out the intention to take forward the repeal of the fire protection provisions in the Local Acts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting out the non-regulatory approach proposed in relation to domestic security and changing places toilets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="draft-approved-documents"&gt;Draft Approved Documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published alongside this section of the consultation is a draft version of a new Approved Document K (protection from falling, collision and impact). Not only does this reflect the proposed changes resulting from the rationalisation of parts K, M and N, it also seeks consultees’ views on the proposed new style of Approved Documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new style has also been applied to a draft revised Approved Document regulation 7 which can be found in the main consultation document as annex I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="other-consultation-sections"&gt;Other consultation sections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other consultation sections cover the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-conservation-of-fuel-and-power"&gt;section 2: part L (conservation of fuel and power)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-electrical-safety"&gt;section 3: part P (electrical safety - dwellings)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-the-building-control-system"&gt;section 4: the building control system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes proposals for tighter carbon dioxide emission standards for new homes and non-domestic buildings, to take the next step towards zero carbon standards, plus tighter performance standards for works to existing buildings. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guidance for local planning authorities on implementing planning requirements of the EU Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) (‘the Directive’) provides an overarching legislative framework for the management of waste across Europe. This guidance note provides advice on the measures required by local planning authorities to ensure compliance with the directive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance is aimed primarily at waste planning authorities, but it highlights the main legal and policy provisions of relevance to all planning authorities, and the action we expect them to take to assist them in ensuring compliance with the directive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be read alongside the government’s planning policy for waste management, currently set out in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-for-sustainable-waste-management-planning-policy-statement-10"&gt;Planning Policy Statement 10&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-for-sustainable-waste-management-a-companion-guide-to-planning-policy-statement-10"&gt;companion guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Strategic environmental assessment about revoking the North West regional strategy: environmental report</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environmental report is a consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revocation of the north west plan and the regional economic strategy (which together form the regional strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report succeeds the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919154703/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/revocationnwrss"&gt;previous environmental report&lt;/a&gt; on the revocation of the north west regional strategy which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012. It is a stand alone document the intention of which is to provide the reader with an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of the revocation of the north west plan and the regional economic strategy without the need to refer back to the previous environmental report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note: Due to the size of the documents this publication can also be supplied on a CD-ROM. Please email requests to &lt;a href="mailto:SEAConsultation@communities.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;SEAConsultation@communities.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DCLG statement of new regulation - 1 January to 30 June 2013</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forward look of all regulations in scope of government’s ‘one-in, two-out’ regime that are scheduled to come into force between 1 January and 30 June 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is published every 6 months to give businesses an indication of when regulations affecting them will be coming into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headline figures show:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are introducing 24 measures in this period, 20 of which are deregulatory measures that will reduce the burden on business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;none of these measures will increase the regulatory burden on businesses, as they are all either deregulatory measures that will bring savings to business, or regulatory measures that have no cost to business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Regulatory Policy Committee have evaluated 5 of our measures and estimated that they will reduce the burden on business by £45.36 million per year. We expect this figure to rise considerably as our other measures are validated.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Tracking economic and child income deprivation at neighbourhood level in England: 1999 to 2009</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This release presents the Economic Deprivation Index and the Children in Income Deprived households Index. These indices track levels of economic deprivation from 1999 to 2009 in small areas in England called Lower-layer Super Output Areas (&lt;abbr title="Lower-layer Super Output Areas"&gt;LSOAs&lt;/abbr&gt;). Key points from this release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;economic deprivation is not spread evenly across the country; in 2009, the proportion of people aged under 60 living in income-deprived households ranged from 0% to 71% across &lt;abbr title="Lower-layer Super Output Areas"&gt;LSOAs&lt;/abbr&gt;; employment deprivation rates were similarly wide-ranging&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on average, income deprivation rates fell between 1999 and 2008, but increased between 2008 and 2009; the most deprived &lt;abbr title="Lower-layer Super Output Areas"&gt;LSOAs&lt;/abbr&gt; saw the greatest decreases between 1999 and 2008 and the greatest increases from 2008 to 2009; the pattern was similar for employment deprivation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there was a wide spread in the distribution of child income deprivation rates across &lt;abbr title="Lower-layer Super Output Areas"&gt;LSOAs&lt;/abbr&gt;, ranging from 2% to 98% in 2009 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 local authorities appear in the 10 most economically deprived local authorities nationally each year between 1999 and 2009: Hackney, Knowsley, Liverpool, Newham and Tower Hamlets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;similarly, there were 7 consistently deprived local authorities in terms of child income deprivation: Tower Hamlets, Islington, Hackney, Newham, Manchester, Lambeth and Haringey &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 supporting reports containing preliminary analysis to accompany the data, and a detailed description of the methodology and definitions has been published by the Social Disadvantage Research Centre at the University of Oxford. The ‘Tracking Neighbourhoods’ reports are available on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oisp.ox.ac.uk/res/poverty-and-social-exclusion/indices-of-deprivation.html"&gt;University of Oxford website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>DCLG spending data: October 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HM Treasury requires that all central government departments publish details of their spending for transactions over £25,000, and publish monthly data by the last day of each month. This department has lowered its threshold and publishes its transactions over £250.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available below are the spending report and the Government Procurement Card spending report for October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points to note on this report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;over £250 transparency spending data is taken from SAP’s general ledger payment transactions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as required by HM Treasury, the data relates to accounts payable payments and credit note transactions for grants and procurement expenditure, recorded at the time the transaction was processed on SAP. The data excludes any subsequent journal transactions and accounts receivable receipts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;travel, subsistence and other employee transactions - these are currently published on a summarised anonomised basis. They are summarised by ‘Expense area’, then ‘Expense type’, by day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the terms ‘localism’ and ‘neighbourhoods’ in the spreadsheets refer to groups within DCLG. They cover policy areas such as housing, planning and local government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data is published in CSV and Excel formats in payment date sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Building Regulations Part L: proposals for consequential improvements in existing homes - report of focus groups</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government commissioned AECOM to research and examine the views of small businesses (gas safe engineers, competent persons, small builders and small architects) and building control officers on proposed changes to part L of the building regulations for consequential improvements in existing homes. This report details the findings from the 4 focus groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals are part of a package of changes to the building regulations published for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-conservation-of-fuel-and-power"&gt;consultation&lt;/a&gt; in January 2012, and this research was part of the consultation exercise. All the proposals described in this report are subject to consultation, and nothing in this document is a statement of government policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
