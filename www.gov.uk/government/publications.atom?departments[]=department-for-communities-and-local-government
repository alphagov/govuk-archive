    <title>Affordable housing starts and completions funded by the HCA and the GLA - April to September 2012-13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics on affordable housing starts and completions funded by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) and the Greater London Authority (GLA) were released on Friday 16 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures show the supply of homes delivered under the accelerated land disposal programme, the 2011-15 affordable homes programme (including the affordable homes programme, empty homes, homelessness change, mortgage rescue and traveller pitch funding), the economic assets programme, firstbuy, the get Britain building programme, the kickstart housing delivery programme, the national affordable housing programme and the property and regeneration programme. Details about these programmes can be found in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/housing-statistics"&gt;HCA Housing statistics release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 1 April and 30 September 2012, there were 3,735 affordable housing starts on site delivered in England through programmes managed by the HCA and the GLA. This represents an increase of 678 per cent compared to the 480 (revised) started in the same period of the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Between 1 April and 30 September 2012, there were 11,432 affordable housing completions delivered through programmes through programmes managed by the HCA and the GLA. This represents a decrease of 11 per cent compared to the 12,778 completed in the same period in the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on the number of affordable homes delivered under the HCA affordable housing programmes is published twice a year. From April 2012, the Mayor of London has had strategic oversight of housing, regeneration and economic development in London. This means that the HCA no longer publish affordable housing starts and completions for London and this responsibility has been taken over by the GLA. DCLG combines data from the HCA and the GLA to publish six monthly affordable housing starts and completions delivered nationally under the affordable housing programmes of the HCA and GLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about the HCA affordable housing statistics, see their &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/housing-statistics"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Technical review of planning appeal procedures</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published: 1 November 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is consulting on a set of proposals to make the planning appeals process faster and more transparent, improve consistency and certainty in decision taking timescales. The proposals will bring cost and time benefits for those appealing decisions and local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-housing-sales-in-england-2011-to-2012"/>
    <title>Social housing sales in England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents official statistics on the number of sales of existing social housing stock in England for 2011 to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social housing sales include sales under right to buy, preserved right to buy, right to acquire, social homebuy, other outright or shared equity sales to tenants, and sales of existing stock to the private sector. The figures exclude sales through low cost home ownership schemes where these do not relate to existing social stock, i.e. sales of newly built homes for shared ownership or acquisitions of private sector homes for affordable home ownership. Intra-tenure transfers between social housing providers are also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were an estimated 9,670 total social housing sales in England in 2011-12. This is an increase of 15% on 2010-11 but continues the low level of sales seen since 2008-09. The increase was entirely due to an increase in private registered provider sales; local authority sales were virtually unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were an estimated 3,720 right to buy sales in England in 2011-12 (38% of all sales), a 1% increase from 2010-11. Most (70%) right to buy sales were of local authority properties. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average market value of a local authority property purchased through right to buy in 2011-12 was £100,040. Average capital receipts were £73,350 and the average discount was £26,690 per property. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Registered provider sales in 2011-12 included 140 properties sold through the right to acquire scheme (compared to 200 in 2010-11) and 40 through social homebuy (compared to 110 in 2010-11).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A further 3,320 sales (34% of total sales) were disposals of registered provider properties to the private sector. Other shared equity and outright sales of existing stock accounted for the remaining sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics relate to right to buy sales by local authorities and registered providers. The statistics include sales under the right to buy and preserved right to buy schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>House building in England: July to September 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on house building in England were released on 15 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics in this release present figures on new build housing starts and completions in England. Figures for the UK and constituent countries are also available in the accompanying tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics report on the period July to September 2012 and update those previously released on 16 August 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seasonally adjusted house building starts in England increased by 18% and stood at 25,760 in the September quarter 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seasonally adjusted completions fell, down 7% to 27,060 in the September quarter 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private enterprise housing starts (seasonally adjusted) were 15% higher in the September quarter 2012 than the previous quarter, whilst starts by housing associations were 23% higher.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seasonally adjusted private enterprise completions fell by 6% and housing association completions fell by 14% from the previous quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seasonally adjusted starts are now 52% above the trough in the March quarter 2009 but 45% below the December quarter 2005 peak. Completions are 44% below their March quarter 2007 peak.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Annual housing starts totalled 98,020 in the 12 months to September 2012, down by 9% compared with the year before. Annual housing completions in England reached 117,190 in the 12 months to September 2012, an increase of 6% compared with the previous 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>DCLG Public Data and Transparency Programme Board</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are committed to transparency within government. We have gone beyond the commitments set out by the Prime Minister in 2010, in particular by publishing spend over £250 and spend on the Government Procurement Card. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DCLG Public Data and Transparency Programme Board will exist until the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="local-public-data-panel"&gt;Local Public Data Panel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We support the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://data.gov.uk/blog/local-public-data-panel"&gt;Local Public Data Panel&lt;/a&gt;, chaired by Professor Nigel Shadbolt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was established to help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the release of local public data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;information sharing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set common standards for releasing data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make local public services better understood and more accessible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel aims to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure understanding of the case for making local public data freely available for re-use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promote innovative uses of local public data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sponsor the further development of a single place on line at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://data.gov.uk/"&gt;data.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; for all public sector data, while meeting the specific needs of the local government sector&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;encourage agreed standards for greater data and information sharing by local strategic partnerships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel operates a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://data.gov.uk/blog/local-public-data-panel"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; where you can see activity and read the minutes of their meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="making-a-difference-with-data"&gt;Making a Difference with Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.madwdata.org.uk/"&gt;Making a Difference with Data&lt;/a&gt; initiative aims to raise awareness about how you can access data from local public services such as local authorities, the police and the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use it to raise issues, campaign, and influence decision-making in your local community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative brings together stories and examples showing how local information and data is being used to make a difference in important areas. The initiative is funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) in partnership with Improvement and Efficiency West Midlands (IEWM) and is supported by the Local Public Data Panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent project under this initiative, DCLG, in partnership with the London Borough of Lambeth, has developed an &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.lambeth-in-numbers.co.uk/login"&gt;on-line tool&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate how better access to information can help improve policy and decision-making at the local level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool will be used to stimulate further debate in Lambeth and other local authorities about open data.  We want this to help councils and their residents and communities understand what data is available and how they can use it to influence local public services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
