    <title>Communities Ministers wish the Jewish community a happy Chanukah</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to take this opportunity to recognise the huge contribution the Jewish Community have made, and continue to make, towards British society and culture. We have seen some marvellous examples of this throughout the year such as Barnet and District Synagogue joining a food collection with their local church as part of ‘A Year of Service’. The annual triumph of ‘Mitzvah Day’ has also seen thousands of people across the globe volunteer - from improving the local environment, working with the homeless or visiting care homes - these activities have all made a real difference to their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I saw this first hand when I recently attended a multi-faith volunteering event organised by a local synagogue in St Albans. It was terrific to see how so many people gave their time to help the wider community, and come together with those of other faiths at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d like to wish the whole Jewish community a very happy Chanukah.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith Minister Baroness Warsi said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As each candle is lit over the next eight nights during the Festival of Lights, I want to wish all Jewish communities a very happy and peaceful Chanukah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The lighting of the menorah candles remind us of the persistence of hope and endurance through difficult times and I want to acknowledge the role that the Jewish community play within our wider society. I work closely with many Jewish groups in my role as Minister for Faith and Communities and particularly enjoyed visiting a ‘Mitzvah Mummies’ event - a volunteering project where mothers and their babies visited residential care homes - earlier this month. It was wonderful to see the joy this brought the residents and it showed how faith can bring people together and have such a positive impact on the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Happy holidays to you all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Royal Marines storm former Cold War base</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a scenario based around a hostile occupying force, the Royal Marines from the Lead Commando Group (&lt;abbr title="Lead Commando Group"&gt;LCG&lt;/abbr&gt;) joined up with their Albanian counterparts to practise their training for contingent operations as part of Royal Navy exercise Cougar 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the cover of smoke grenades, the combined forces quickly pounced on the ‘enemy’ lurking in the old submarine base on Sazan Island, taking them by surprise and then fighting their way through a complex labyrinth of bunkers and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 16 hours the Anglo-Albanian forces chased the enemy down, pushing them back all the time as they exercised the skills being practiced under Cougar 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Ric Moat of Zulu Company, 45 Commando Royal Marines, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The size and scale of Sazan Island is impressive. It provides a unique training opportunity for amphibious forces. It is a stern test, it is realistic, and it is demanding training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Raiding from the sea is clearly a different challenge to our land operations in Afghanistan, but it is no less challenging to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the old Soviet submarine base, Sazan Island is home to a chemical and biological weapons plant and there are more than 100 buildings and 5.7 square kilometres of trenches and bunkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="British and Albanian forces taking part in Exercise Albanian Lion on Sazan Island" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1487/Royal_Marines_storm_former_Cold_War_base2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;British and Albanian forces taking part in Exercise Albanian Lion on Sazan Island [Picture: Petty Officer (Photographer) Sean Clee, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Richard Alston of 3 Commando Brigade said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The complexity of the exercise should not be underestimated. We have completed two consecutive night raids and have now pushed reconnaissance teams 110 miles [177km] inland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are currently conducting a non-combatant evacuation exercise with the British embassy staff as part of the exercise scenario and have achieved all this in three days and nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Response Force Task Group, the &lt;abbr title="Lead Commando Group"&gt;LCG&lt;/abbr&gt;, made up of 45 Commando and 3 Commando Brigade, are inserted by sea and Royal Navy warships into trouble spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These operations, such as Libya last year, require a rapid reaction force to quickly deploy in response to unexpected world events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cougar 12 involves more than 3,000 sailors, marines and airmen in addition to four Royal Navy warships and one Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship which provide the platforms to plan the operations and also protect the troops from the sea and air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having practiced their skills alongside French Marines and soldiers in Corsica in October, the &lt;abbr title="Lead Commando Group"&gt;LCG&lt;/abbr&gt; will complete Albanian Lion before heading back to the UK at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Success for British teams in World Helicopter Championship</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competition, in its 14th year, was held outside the Russian capital with two teams from the British Services taking part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Helicopter Club of Great Britain invited the crews to compete as part of the British team following their successes at the British and German Championships in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Championship requires the crews to exercise their skills through a number of flying tests including an obstacle course which involves dangling a bucket of water below the helicopter whilst negotiating a slalom course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two teams comprised instructors from the Defence Helicopter Flying School (DHFS), whose day job is to teach all UK military helicopter pilots and crews for all three Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main team, comprising Squadron Leader Craig Finch and Mr John ‘JJ’ Jackson, an ex-RAF airman, are the current British champions, and were successful at both the UK and European competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also taking part in the competition was the second team, which paired Flight Lieutenant Mark Lazenby with Lieutenant Jim Fraser of the Royal Navy and was managed by Flying Officer Ryan Stowe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two Squirrel helicopters flown by the British teams were provided by FBHeliservices who own and operate the aircraft flown at RAF Shawbury. Mr Gareth Mayfield from FBHeliservices travelled with the aircraft to provide engineering support throughout the Championship. The company has been instrumental in ensuring that the teams have been able to compete at the highest level.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Championship ran from 22 to 26 August at Drakino Airfield in Russia, with 50 teams taking part from across the world. Twenty-five of those teams were made up of Russian or Belarusian crews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six teams competed for the team prize with the UK pairing of Finch and Jackson taking the silver medal having finished a creditable second behind Russia. In the overall competition the pair finished 13th out of 50 whilst the pairing of Lazenby/Fraser finished in 30th place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medal presentation took place on Sunday 26 August and was attended by the Moscow Defence Attache. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flight Lieutenant Lazenby said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The DHFS crews’ attendance at the WHC reflected their pre-eminence at the National Helicopter Championships and their long-standing success at these and other international events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successful performance of the DHFS crews ably demonstrated the professionalism and skill of UK military aircrew and the success of the military/civil partnership at DHFS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lead DHFS team was the highest-ranked team outside of Russia/Belarus, beating all military and civilian crews from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, China, Poland, France and Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Planning applications: called-in decisions and recovered appeals </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="called-in-planning-applications"&gt;Called-in planning applications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has the power to take over (‘call in’) planning applications rather than letting the local authority decide. The secretary of state will normally only do this if the application conflicts with national policy in important ways, or is nationally significant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He or she has to take published government policy into account when deciding whether or not to call in a planning application, and when making the decision. If the secretary of state decides to call in a planning application, an inspector is appointed to carry out an inquiry into the proposal. The secretary of state has to take the inspector’s findings into account when making the decision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="recovered-planning-appeals"&gt;Recovered planning appeals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning &lt;strong&gt;appeals&lt;/strong&gt; can also be ‘recovered’ for decision by ministers. A recovered appeal is one where instead of an inspector making the decision, he or she will write a report that will make a recommendation on how the appeal should be determined. This will then be passed to the secretary of state to make the decision, taking into account the inspector’s recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="called-in-planning-applications-1"&gt;Called-in planning applications&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Proposed transfer of Homes and Communities Agency functions and assets to Milton Keynes Council</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a request by Milton Keynes Council to take greater strategic control of growth and delivery in their area, they asked to acquire full control of planning functions. Currently the Homes and Community Agency is responsible for considering certain types of planning applications for specific areas of Milton Keynes (mainly the areas designated as ‘expansion areas’).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many strands to this transfer package, this document seeks views on the transfer of those planning functions back to Milton Keynes Council only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister praises local government efforts to tackle fraud </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is essential for local government to take action to tackle fraud in every possible way and therefore help prevent the current loss of £2 billion of taxpayers’ money, Baroness Hanham said in a keynote address on 6 December 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remarks came as the review on the local government’s ‘Fighting Fraud locally’ report was launched at the annual Fighting Fraud Locally conference, which highlighted the progress made by councils in 2012 in reducing the risks they face. Fraud costs every adult in the country about £1,140 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event, attended by over 200 local authority members, the minister said councils needed to assess whether they had sufficient controls in place to prevent fraud happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister praised the action already taken by most councils to tackle fraud and encouraged them all to follow the lead set by the &lt;abbr title="Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith and Fulham"&gt;west London tri-borough authorities&lt;/abbr&gt;, in particular in the investigation of tenancy fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baroness Hanham said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fraud costs this country more than £73 billion a year, over £2 billion of which is lost to local government. This is a complete waste of taxpayers money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is essential councils do everything they can to not only prevent fraud, but recover lost money and pursue fraudsters in court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The approaches recommended in the local government’s ‘Fighting Fraud Locally’ report sets out how to tackle local fraud through better detection and fraud recovery. Councils cannot afford to have resources meant for vulnerable people and front line services being stolen by fraudsters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is helping create an environment where councils can tackle tenancy fraud, in particular through a series of measures including: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through the provisions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/preventionofsocialhousingfraud.html"&gt;Prevention of Social Housing Fraud Bill&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leading on the request in &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/nfa/fighting-fraud-locally-strategy/"&gt;Fighting Fraud Locally&lt;/a&gt; for central government to enable there to be greater information sharing to identify fraud and fraudsters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area--2/supporting-pages/localising-council-tax-support"&gt;localising council tax support&lt;/a&gt;, which will give councils a strong incentive to reduce fraud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest survey of fraud against local bodies can be found in the Audit Commission’s report, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/fraud/protecting-the-public-purse/Pages/protecting-the-public-purse-2012.aspx"&gt;Protecting the Public Purse 2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Owning common land</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidance below applies to England. For Wales see &lt;a rel="external" href="http://wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/farmingandcountryside/common/?lang=en"&gt;Common Land on the Welsh Government website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals who are able to exercise ‘rights of common’ over another person’s land are generally known as ‘commoners’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you own common land, your rights are subject to statutory controls and the commoners’ interests. As commons frequently have large numbers of legal interests involved, reaching agreement on collective management can often be difficult. In response to this, the government has introduced legislation which enables commons to be managed more sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide looks at the main issues surrounding common land, including registration, agricultural management of commons and protection of common land. It also discusses public rights of way and how the management of common land affects issues of Cross Compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rights-of-common"&gt;Rights of common&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are about 550,000 hectares of registered common land in England and Wales - around 373,570 of which are in England - and some 80% is privately owned. Common land is land that is owned by someone, over which someone else - sometimes several other people - are entitled to exercise ‘rights of common’. Someone who owns these rights is known as a ‘commoner’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owners have the same basic rights as other landowners, subject to statutory controls and the interests of the commoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you own land that is subject to rights of common, they could include some or all of the rights to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;graze sheep or cattle on your land - known as a ‘right of herbage’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take peat or turf from your land - a ‘right of turbary’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take wood, gorse or furze from your land - a ‘right of estovers’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take fish from waterways on your land - a ‘right of piscary’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allow pigs to eat acorns or beechmast on your land - a ‘right of pannage’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commoners may be either active or inactive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active commoners are those who exercise their rights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inactive commoners do not currently exercise their rights, and may not even be aware of them. However, the legal right still exists if it is registered and may be exercised at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="rights-over-your-land"&gt;Rights over your land&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rights of common are usually attached to nearby properties, and the occupiers of those properties are entitled to exercise them. However, they are generally not tradable commodities. When occupiers leave those properties, they do not take their rights with them - the new occupiers can exercise them instead. Some rights are not attached to properties - these are called ‘rights in gross’. Commoners will have been required to register the number of animals for which they claimed rights of grazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure whether someone has rights in common over your land, you can check the registers held by commons registrations authorities (see below). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not generally possible to sell rights of common separately from the land to which they were attached - a process known as ‘severance’ - there are few limited exceptions to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="management-of-common-land"&gt;Management of common land&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The management of common land must take into account the interests of both the owner and the commoners. Where there is good co-operation amongst active commoners and the owner, the land can be effectively managed and remain a resource for both the owner and the commoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is difficult to manage commons where there are few active commoners, and where the owner of the land does not use it. For example, where grazing on land has ceased, it is sometimes difficult to re-introduce it, and where common land is not effectively managed, commoners may not want to use it and its value may be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, common land which is over-used - by, for example, being grazed by too many animals - can be seriously damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the aims of the Commons Act 2006 is to address the issue of commons management. Historically, many commons have commoners’ committees or associations which meet to discuss issues relating to management. However, these organisations are voluntary, with no force of law or legal status. Therefore, individual commoners can go against the wishes of the majority of their neighbours - for example by refusing to adjust their grazing levels to the general benefit of the site, or by not participating in collaborative management schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2006 Act allows self-regulating statutory commons councils to be set up to manage common land at a local level where they can manage their affairs by majority voting. They are set up where there is substantial support among commoners and, where appropriate, landowners. The banning of severance of common rights - with limited exceptions - maintains the link between common rights and the local community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="statutory-commons-councils"&gt;Statutory commons councils&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key provisions of the Commons Act 2006 is to allow statutory commons councils to be established. These bodies have powers to manage common land, allowing interested parties - landowners, commoners and the local community - to work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is anticipated that commons councils will be appropriate in a relatively small number of cases, where commons are in agricultural management but where reaching agreement among stakeholders can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, the request to set up a council will be made by those with legal interests in the common - ie commoners, landowners and others with statutory rights or obligations on the land. A commons council can only be established if the Secretary of State has concluded that there is substantial support. This can be decided by a public inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commons Act recognises that commons have different needs, so each council is separately established with its own establishment order - although the Act does provide that a standard constitution must be incorporated for each council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commons councils can be set up with responsibility for single commons. However, they are likely to have more resources and be more useful if they incorporate several commons - eg Dartmoor Commons Council. They will allow all interested parties to work together to improve management of agricultural activities, vegetation and the exercise of common rights on the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="powers-of-commons-councils"&gt;Powers of commons councils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commons councils have the power to make rules, by majority voting, that are binding on everyone with legal interests in the common. This can also help commons to benefit from funding schemes by acting as a single voice when negotiating commons management and ensuring that Cross Compliance requirements are observed by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, commons councils can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;share information and help interested parties to work together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decide whether and for how long common rights can be leased&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;provide a mediation service when breaches occur&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;keep live registers of stock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;negotiate with the Rural Payments Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lobby to improve policies in relation to commons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="commons-registration-authorities"&gt;Commons registration authorities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commons registration authorities (&lt;abbr title="Commons registration authorities"&gt;CRAs&lt;/abbr&gt;) - generally county councils - were established by the Commons Registration Act 1965. They are responsible for keeping registers of common land and of town or village greens, along with information about rights over registered land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;County councils, metropolitan borough councils and London borough councils act as &lt;abbr title="Commons registration authorities"&gt;CRAs&lt;/abbr&gt;, and their main role is to maintain the registers, conduct searches, handle applications for amendments, such as removing common land from the registers, and register new town and village greens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commons registers are open for public inspection, and an appointment is not usually needed, although it is worth checking. There is no charge for having a copy of a registry entry, although the registration authority may charge for making a physical photocopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="accuracy-of-registers"&gt;Accuracy of registers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commons Act 2006 introduced new responsibilities for &lt;abbr title="Commons registration authorities"&gt;CRAs&lt;/abbr&gt;, including the requirement to update and maintain registers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following an extensive pilot scheme, &lt;abbr title="Commons registration authorities"&gt;CRAs&lt;/abbr&gt; will have a legal responsibility to keep registers up to date, and will have powers to correct mistakes in existing registers. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/rural/protected/commonland/registration.htm"&gt;find archived information about progress on common land registration on the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rights-of-public-access-on-common-land"&gt;Rights of public access on common land&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public have statutory rights to walk on nearly all registered common land, usually under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (&lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt;) Act 2000. These rights are different to public rights of way and are known as ‘&lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt; rights’ (also popularly referred to as the ‘right to roam’).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some commons have access rights which predate and take precedence over the &lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt; Act. On many of these there is a right to ride as well as walk (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public are entitled to walk on registered common land without confinement to paths. This access is often subject to certain common sense restrictions - eg not leaving gates open or lighting fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right of access on common land are taken to include activities such as walking, sightseeing, bird watching, picnicking, climbing and running. The &lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt; Act does not convey the right to participate in cycling, fishing, horse riding, camping or driving a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occupiers who have an agreement under the Environmental Stewardship (ES) scheme must maintain existing rights of way and abide by the relevant legislation. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.gov.uk/ourwork/farming/funding/es/default.aspx"&gt;find more about Environmental Stewardship on the Natural England website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.gov.uk/ourwork/farming/funding/es/uplandsels/default.aspx"&gt;find out about Uplands &lt;abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship"&gt;ELS&lt;/abbr&gt; on the Natural England website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="restricting-access-to-crow-act-common-land"&gt;Restricting access to &lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt; Act common land&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landowners are entitled to give notice restricting access to common land for up to 28 days each year without application, except for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bank holidays&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more than four Saturdays a year between June and August&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more than four Sundays a year between June and September&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you plan to restrict access to common land, you should notify the Open Access Contact Centre on 0845 100 3298.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also apply to make further restrictions for purposes of land management, fire prevention or public safety. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/rural/protected/commonland/index.htm"&gt;find information on common land restrictions on the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who uses your land has a responsibility to take normal precautions to prevent damage or danger to land or livestock. On &lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt; access land all dogs must be kept on short, fixed leads of no more than 2 metres in length between 1 March and 31 July, and at any time when they are near livestock. You also have powers to exclude dogs from small enclosures used for lambing or across grouse moors. It is an offence to allow a dog to attack or chase livestock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you cannot use &lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt; restrictions on certain areas having access rights that pre-date the &lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt; Act. The earlier rights were registered in Section 15 of the &lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt; Act - and are known as section 15 land. Section 15 land has precedence over &lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt; rights where they overlap with mapped open country, registered common land, or land dedicated for access under Section 15 of the Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="crow-rights-and-public-liability"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt; rights and public liability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a landowner, you have a reduced level of public liability on access land. You cannot be sued for any damage or injury caused by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any natural feature of the landscape - including any trees, shrubs, plants, or any rivers, streams, ditches or ponds, whether natural or man-made&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;people passing over, under or through any wall, fence gate, except by proper use of the gate or stile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not include instances where a landowner sets out to create a risk or allows a risk to pose a danger to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if an animal injures someone or causes damage on &lt;abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act"&gt;CRoW&lt;/abbr&gt; access land, you may be liable if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the animal should have been restrained as it was likely to cause injury or damage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the injury or damage caused was or could have been severe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the animal’s characteristics are abnormal in that species, except at particular times or in particular circumstances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you or the person keeping the animals knew that the animal posed a risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned about your liability, you should seek legal advice. You can also apply for a restriction of public access on your land to protect the public if you are aware of any possible risk - eg during calving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cross-compliance-and-common-land"&gt;Cross Compliance and common land&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you claim agricultural payments under the Single Payment Scheme, you must comply fully with the Cross Compliance rules across all of your agricultural land - not just that on which you claim payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good agricultural and environmental conditions (&lt;abbr title="Good agricultural and environmental conditions"&gt;GAECs&lt;/abbr&gt;) are statutory requirements for you to keep your land in good condition and to maintain habitat and landscape that are important to the English countryside. This applies equally to any common land that you manage - the only practical difference is that good condition is dependent on all stakeholders (owner and commoners) working collaboratively. In some circumstances, Soil Protection Reviews will not be necessary on common land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out more &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farming-advice/cross-compliance/"&gt;about Cross Compliance on the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/6EB355EA8482EA61802573B1003D2469?Opendocument"&gt;standards of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (&lt;abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition"&gt;GAEC&lt;/abbr&gt;) on the &lt;abbr title="Rural Payments Agency"&gt;RPA&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="works-on-common-land"&gt;Works on common land&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Section 38 of the Commons Act 2006, it is an offence to carry out ‘restricted works’ without permission on any common land that you own or manage. Restricted works are defined as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;works which prevent or impede access to or over common land - eg erecting fences, digging trenches or constructing buildings or embankments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any resurfacing work involving laying down new concrete, tarmacadam or similar material&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will not need permission if you are repairing an existing surface using the same material - eg using concrete to mend cracks in an existing concrete path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to carry out restricted works on your common land, you should apply to the Planning Inspectorate for permission. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/pins/common_land/forms/section_38_application_form.pdf"&gt;download an application form for consent to construct works on common land from the Planning Inspectorate website (PDF, 175KB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/countryside/commonland/guidance"&gt;find common land guidance sheets on the Planning Inspectorate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before applying for works on common land you should &lt;a rel="external" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/730889?category=40026"&gt;follow the guidance in the publication ‘A Common Purpose’ on the Natural England website&lt;/a&gt; which advises common land managers on how to reach consensus on the management of the common. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information-on-common-land"&gt;Further information on common land&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further information on managing common land is available in other guides on this website, and from the following organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major roles of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (&lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt;) is to help the farming industry operate as efficiently as possible. &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; administers European support policies that provide around £3 billion to UK agriculture. They also oversee a number of agencies that work with arable farmers, imports and exports of crops and implement pest and disease controls. You can call the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; Helpline on 08459 33 55 77.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rural Payments Agency (&lt;abbr title="Rural Payments Agency"&gt;RPA&lt;/abbr&gt;) is responsible for licences and schemes for growers as well as for running the Single Payment Scheme (&lt;abbr title="Single Payment Scheme"&gt;SPS&lt;/abbr&gt;). For more information about &lt;abbr title="Single Payment Scheme"&gt;SPS&lt;/abbr&gt; and how it can help your farming business, you can call the &lt;abbr title="Rural Payments Agency"&gt;RPA&lt;/abbr&gt; Helpline on 0845 603 7777.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/vDocView/FFFDD11D4803F7D580256F72003DD33D?OpenDocument"&gt;find out more about the &lt;abbr title="Single Payment Scheme"&gt;SPS&lt;/abbr&gt; on the &lt;abbr title="Rural Payments Agency"&gt;RPA&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers are likely to come into contact with local authorities over a number of farming, land use, food standards and environmental regulations. Your local authority may also be able to provide further information or resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oss.org.uk/"&gt;Open Spaces Society&lt;/a&gt; can assist with questions about the law, management and protection of common land.&lt;/p&gt;
