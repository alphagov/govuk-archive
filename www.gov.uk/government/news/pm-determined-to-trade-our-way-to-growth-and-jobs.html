<p>The measures include a £95 million investment from the Regional Growth Fund to benefit hundreds of small businesses. The funding will support SMEs considering investing in new capital assets and is expected to create at least 4,000 jobs and unlock around £500 million of new investment. </p>

<p>The Government is also teaming up with founding Dragons’ Den panellist Doug Richard and Yell to get 3,500 businesses into workshops all over the country to ensure they are able to exploit the global opportunities offered by the internet.</p>

<p>There is also a series of commitments from banks and business advisers to fuel business growth, including: Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) partnering with Barclays to provide free finance advice for SMEs; Lloyds launching a network of export mentors and Santander organising trade missions to Brazil.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister announced the business growth package at the ‘<em>Exporting for Growth’</em> conference at the London Imax. The conference brought together SMEs, banks, business advisers and trade bodies to encourage more businesses to export, and ensure that they have the finance they need to grow.</p>

<p>Prime Minister David Cameron said:</p>

<p>“British SMEs are already doing incredible things, but we urgently need more of them to follow that boldness. We need this to be a country where more people think ‘I can start my own business and I can sell to the world. </p>

<p>“Our determination is to come through these difficult times stronger, to trade our way to growth and jobs. We need to show real optimism about the future, and we need to show real aggression about pursuing Britain’s interests in the world. The markets are there to be tapped; the deals are there to be done, the opportunities are there to be capitalised on. Now together we must seize them.”</p>

<p>Business Secretary Vince Cable said:</p>

<p>“Securing a return to long-term economic growth is the Government’s highest priority. Helping entrepreneurs export to new markets and get access to the finance they need are critical to making this a reality.</p>

<p>“Today, not only are we able to announce substantial new measures to support businesses, but also to see the commitment of private sector firms and organisations to tackling the economic challenges we face. We want to reach and help the 80 per cent of SMEs who don’t seek external advice before applying for finance.</p>

<p>“The small firms of today are Britain’s international success stories of our future and it is this success that will build the strong, balanced economy that will secure our economic prosperity.”</p>

<p>Lord Green, Minister of State for Trade and Investment, said: </p>

<p>“Government alone cannot turn round the export performance of this country.</p>

<p>“We need to work with those that have most to do with small companies, can help them to understand the benefits of exporting, and can then help make it a reality.</p>

<p>“Our future prosperity will not come from relying on domestic markets alone. Across the world there are markets that are showing strong, long-term growth. We want to make sure that UK firms are not just trading abroad but thriving there. UKTI has a crucial role to play and will seek to double its client base from around 25,000 companies to around 50,000 over the next three years.”</p>

<p>Business and Enterprise Minister Mark Prisk said:</p>

<p>“Small firms must be able to get access to the finance they need to grow. The Finance Fitness campaign we are launching today will equip them with the advice and guidance they need to do so. </p>

<p>“The wide range of public and private finance options available can be daunting to a new entrepreneur. 15 per cent of SMEs do not apply for finance despite needing it, so we want to provide these businesses with the knowledge and confidence to secure the finance that is right for them.”</p>

<p>**The Government announced today that:  </p>

<p>**- £95 million of Regional Growth Fund money has been allocated for SMEs who can’t access commercial funding. This is being directed to small businesses through RBS, Natwest and HSBC - and it is expected to unlock a further £500 million of investment. The fund uses the high street banks to provide finance for SMEs seeking to purchase assets and create employment, which are unable to secure commercial funding for their project;  </p>
