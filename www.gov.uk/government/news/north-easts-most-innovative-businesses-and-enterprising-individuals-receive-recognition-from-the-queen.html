<p>The North East’s most enterprising individuals and businesses will tomorrow (Thursday 14 July) attend an evening reception at Buckingham Palace after they were announced as this year’s winners of The Queen’s Awards for Enterprise 2011.</p>

<p>Seven companies and two individuals who have, or will be presented with their awards by the Lord Lieutenant throughout the year, will have the opportunity to meet Her Majesty The Queen and other members of the Royal Family: the ultimate recognition of their commitment to enterprise and innovation.</p>

<p>Today, winning companies from the region encouraged other North East firms to apply for the 2012 awards, which come at the time of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and also the Olympics.</p>

<p>And one firm has already recorded an increase of almost 50 per cent additional visits to their website since its Queen’s Award for International Trade was announced, some of which have already turned into new business.</p>

<p>Gary Ashton, sales director at Tiger Filtration Ltd, in Sunderland which designs, tests and manufactures a comprehensive range of compressed air and gas filtration products, said: “We would advise all companies in the North East to consider applying for a Queen’s Award as the advantages of winning can never be underestimated.</p>

<p>“Being a small company with ten employees - to be rewarded in this way is a real privilege and an achievement we are all very proud of. Feedback from both our UK and export customers has been extremely positive and the benefits of having the award are already becoming apparent due to the increased interest in our product portfolio.</p>

<p>Before the reception, Business Secretary Vince Cable will present some of Britain’s most enterprising individuals; including Alison Brown and Ron Batty with The Queen’s Award for Enterprise Promotion which rewards individuals who have played an outstanding and significant role in promoting the growth of business enterprise, entrepreneurial skills and attitudes in others. </p>

<p>Mr Batty, who received a Lifetime Achievement Award, is former Chief Executive of CDC Enterprise Agency in Durham, a post he held for 25 years before his retirement in December 2010. The agency has grown in stature under his leadership and is now seen as an exemplar, particularly for establishing an enterprise culture in an area of social, commercial and economic disadvantage. Since his retirement, Mr Batty continues to work with the agency as a director and consultant and also carries out volunteer work mentoring the Durham Future Business Magnates, a competition for 13-year-old schoolchildren, and the Durham Retail Business Awards, aimed at enterprise promotion.</p>

<p>He said: “I’m delighted to have been involved with CDC Enterprise Agency for the past 25 years. Supporting the growth of enterprise is vital and needs to be encouraged from as early an age as possible, which is why we work with local schools. We help those with ideas set up in business, but it doesn’t stop there as you need to continue that enterprise to ensure the ongoing success of the company.</p>

<p>“I was completely surprised, honoured and humbled when I found out about my Queen’s Award - I had absolutely no idea I had been nominated. To be honoured in this way and be given the chance to meet the Queen and Prince Philip is certainly an experience I will never forget.</p>

<p>“I know there are many enterprising companies in the North East and I would urge them to apply for next year’s Queen’s Awards to gain recognition for their endeavours.”</p>

<p>Alison Brown is Head of Technology and Director of Specialism at Catcote School Business and Enterprise College, Hartlepool where she has worked for 14 years. She has promoted enterprise at the college and taken it from having no enterprise or vocational education to win recognition locally, regionally and nationally as a Centre of Excellence in Enterprise Education. It is now the only Specialist Business and Enterprise College in Hartlepool and was one of the first in the country to achieve such status.</p>

<p>She said: “It is with pride that I accept this honour and Royal recognition for myself and the rest of Catcote School Business and Enterprise College. I would like to thank them for their support and inspiration.”</p>

<p>Headteacher Alan Chapman added: “Winning the award is true recognition of the work that Alison does in promoting enterprise education for children and young people with learning disabilities. I know that there are many other schools that have embraced an enterprise culture and would encourage other headteachers to look at this award to help celebrate the work carried out in their schools.”</p>

<p>Business Secretary Vince Cable said:</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful to see that even with a difficult economic climate, individuals such as Alison Brown and Ron Batty continue to find enterprising ways of working and helping others to establish their businesses.</p>

<p>“The individuals receiving awards today are an inspiration and I congratulate them on their hard work and their achievement. The opportunity for them to join the business winners and to go to the Palace to celebrate their hard work is well deserved and I hope they have a wonderful time.</p>

<p>“It’s important we create the right conditions for Britain’s new and up- and-coming entrepreneurs to succeed and I strongly encourage businesses to start thinking about nominations for next year.”</p>

<p>Anyone who has helped individuals to develop entrepreneurial approaches and achievements with a view to starting or building a business can be nominated for The Queen’s Award for Enterprise Promotion. These activities can be at both at national or local level.</p>

<p>The awards are made annually by HM The Queen and are only given for the highest levels of excellence demonstrated in each category. They are judged to a demanding level and winners receive a number of benefits and worldwide recognition.</p>

<p>The application/nomination period for The Queen’s Awards for Enterprise 2012 is now open and closes on October 31. Entry is free and forms can be completed and submitted online at <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/queensawards">www.businesslink.gov.uk/queensawards</a> Winners will be announced on April 21 2012.</p>
