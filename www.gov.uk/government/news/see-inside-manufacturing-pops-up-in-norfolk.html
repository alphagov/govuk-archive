<p>The Minister was at Britvic Soft Drinks based at Carrow Works in Norwich where he joined pupils of Sprowston High School who were learning more about modern manufacturing as part of the Government’s See Inside Manufacturing programme.  </p>

<p>See Inside Manufacturing involves businesses from across the food &amp; drink, aerospace &amp; defence and automotive sectors opening their doors in over 100 events throughout June and July to show young people, teachers and careers advisers what exciting opportunities exist in 21st century manufacturing.  </p>

<p>The Minister said:  </p>

<p>“It’s sometimes easy to forget the advanced manufacturing processes and skills needed to create the many products we use every single day, like soft drinks. Behind the scenes there are creative individuals working in modern workplaces, which is what we’re trying to show to people through See Inside Manufacturing.  </p>

<p>“Building on last year’s automotive pilot, we have aerospace &amp; defence and food &amp; drink businesses taking part this year. Thanks to this we have our biggest ever opportunity to help change perceptions of manufacturing and give people a taste of what the industry is like today. I encourage as many people as possible to get involved and come along to one of the many events taking place like today at Britvic.  </p>

<p>“The See Inside Manufacturing programme complements the work of our Make it in Great Britain campaign, which is challenging the perception that we don’t make anything in this country anymore. It will culminate in an exhibition at the Science Museum during the Olympic and Paralympic Games.”  </p>

<p>See Inside Manufacturing sees Government working with industry and is being held in association with the Food and Drink Federation (FDF), Aerospace, Defence &amp; Securities Industries Group (ADS) and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).  </p>

<p>Susan Turner, Head of Corporate Affairs at Britvic, said:  </p>

<p>“As part of our ongoing community investment, in partnership with the BSDA we host a series of professional development programme (PDP) days for teachers at our factories in Norwich, Beckton and Leeds. We also have Britvic Learning Zones at these sites, which is a specifically designed meeting room dedicated to facilitating learning and visits for students, teachers and NEETs.  </p>

<p>“With our PDP sessions and Britvic Learning Zone both geared to providing community education and development, it offers the perfect backdrop for us to get involved with the Government’s See Inside Manufacturing programme this year.”  </p>

<p>FDF Director General Melanie Leech said:  </p>

<p>“It’s great that Norman Lamb is seeing at first-hand how UK food and drink businesses are working with young people and teachers to get them interested in our sector.  </p>

<p>“We know that to stay world-class and to deliver our shared vision with Government of 20% growth by 2020, we will need to attract the best talent and FDF is tackling this through our <em>Taste Success - A Future in Food</em> campaign and involvement in initiatives such as See Inside Manufacturing.  </p>

<p>“Britvic’s Learning Zone and its enterprise and work related learning PDP sessions for teachers are great examples of how companies are both supporting schools and engaging the next generation in food and drink manufacturing.”  </p>

<p>Through See Inside Manufacturing, thousands of people will visit other iconic names such as Nestle, Mars UK, Mini, Toyota UK, Bombardier and Rolls Royce to get hands on with the latest designs and technologies that make Britain one of the world’s leading manufacturing nations.  </p>

<p>The extension of See Inside Manufacturing to the aerospace sector comes ahead of the Farnborough International Air Show next month. The Government has been working closely with the industry through the Aerospace Growth Partnership and will make a number of announcements at the event in July.  </p>

<p>1) **See Inside Manufacturing<br>
**See Inside Manufacturing is a joint initiative between BIS and industry, designed to change outdated perceptions of manufacturing in the UK and build awareness of the career opportunities available in the sector. SIM aims to inform careers influencers about manufacturing, as well as engaging directly with young people, to ensure that future skills provision is catered for. For more information on See Inside Manufacturing, visit the BIS website: <a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/seeinsidemanufacturing/">[http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/seeinsidemanufacturing/](http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/seeinsidemanufacturing/)</a>   </p>

<p>2) **Food and Drink Federation<br>
**The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) is the voice of the food and drink manufacturing industry - the UK’s largest manufacturing sector. For more information about FDF and the industry it represents visit: <a rel="external" href="http://www.fdf.org.uk/">[www.fdf.org.uk](http://www.fdf.org.uk)</a>  </p>

<p>3) **Aerospace, Defence &amp; Securities Industries Group<br>
**ADS is the premier trade organisation for all companies operating in the UK Aerospace, Defence, Security and Space sectors. ADS also encompasses the British Aviation Group (BAG). For more information see <a rel="external" href="http://www.adsgroup.org.uk/">www.adsgroup.org.uk</a>  </p>

<p>4)** SMMT<br>
**The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) is one of the largest and most influential trade associations in the UK.

For more information visit <a rel="external" href="http://www.smmt.co.uk/">www.smmt.co.uk</a>  </p>

<p>5)** Make it in Great Britain <br>
**Launched in November 2011 by Business Secretary Vince Cable and Business Minister Mark Prisk, Make it in Great Britain is a campaign aiming to transform the image of modern UK manufacturing and to raise awareness of its importance for the economy. It is important as manufacturing is a British success story and vital to our economic growth.  </p>

<p>The campaign will culminate in an exhibition which celebrates the best of British manufacturing, held at the Science Museum during the Olympic and Paralympic Games time - 24th July to 9th September. The exhibition will highlight the successes of the manufacturing sector to encourage young people to consider a career in the industry and businesses to invest. British manufacturing is a dynamic sector, offering excellent career and investment opportunities.  </p>

<p>For further information on the Make It in Great Britain campaign, please visit: <a rel="external" href="http://makeitingreatbritain.bis.gov.uk/">[http://makeitingreatbritain.bis.gov.uk/](http://makeitingreatbritain.bis.gov.uk/)</a>   </p>

<p>6) The Government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries.’ It set four ambitions in the <a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf">‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)</a>, published at Budget 2011:</p>

<ul>
<li>To create the most competitive tax system in the G20</li>
  <li>To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business</li>
  <li>To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy</li>
  <li>To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Work is underway across Government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the Government wants the economy to travel.  </p>

<p>7) BIS’s online newsroom contains the latest press notices and speeches, as well as video and images for download. It also features an up to date list of BIS press office contacts.
