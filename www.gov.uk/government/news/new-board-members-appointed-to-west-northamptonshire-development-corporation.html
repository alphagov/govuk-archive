<p>Communities minister Andrew Stunell has today announced three appointments to the Board of West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, the agency driving regeneration in West Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>Councillor Tim Hadland has been appointed as a nominated representative of Northampton Borough Council and Councillor Mary Clarke has been appointed as a nominated representative of South Northamptonshire District Council. In addition, Councillor Richard Church has been reappointed as the nominated representative of Northamptonshire County Council for a second term. All three appointments will run for the remaining life of the Corporation.</p>

<p>Andrew Stunell said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am pleased to announce the appointment of Cllr Mary Clarke and Cllr Tim Hadland to the Board of West Northamptonshire Development Corporation and the reappointment of Cllr Richard Church. These appointments reaffirm the strong links with the local authority partners which are important to the delivery of the key development projects and critical in preparing the way for a fully local delivery body to take over the Corporation’s role.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Markham, Chair of West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m delighted to welcome Councillors Tim Hadland and Mary Clarke to WNDC’s Board and welcome the reappointment of Councillor Richard Church. Tim is a highly experienced and well respected figure in the local community, having served the people of Northampton for over 20 years with the Borough Council. Mary, as leader of South Northamptonshire Council, also brings a wealth of experience and will be a huge asset to the Corporation.</p>

  <p>They succeed Tony Woods and Sandra Barnes respectively, both of whom will be greatly missed. Sandra has been at the Corporation since it’s very beginning, and amongst other projects, was instrumental in establishing the Moat Lane regeneration scheme in Towcester town centre. Similarly, Tony has made an outstanding contribution during his 3 years here, championing the ongoing regeneration of Northampton town centre.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation was established in 2004 to drive forward regeneration, improved infrastructure, investment and sustainable growth in the towns of Northampton, Daventry and Towcester. In October 2010 the Public Bodies Review announced that the corporation would be devolved into a local authority led delivery vehicle based on proposals to be submitted by the local authorities.</p>
