<p>Mike McTighe, Lord Blackwell, Stuart McIntosh and Wanda Goldwag have been appointed to help support the transfer of regulatory responsibilities from Postcomm to Ofcom.  </p>

<p>These are short-term appointments, which will come into immediate effect. </p>

<p>Edward Davey said:</p>

<p>“These appointments will bring a good mix of skills and experience to Postcomm. They will strengthen the already close working relationship between Postcomm and Ofcom and help to ensure a successful transfer to the new regulatory regime, which is provided for in the Postal Services Bill.”</p>

<hr>
<p>**Notes to Editors **</p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>These short-term appointments have been made in accordance with a competition restricted to Postcomm Commissioners and Ofcom Board members as agreed with the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA). These are part-time appointments: remuneration is £22, 824 for 3-4 days per month. Mr McTighe and Lord Blackwell have been appointed for 2 days a month. Mr McIntosh is an executive Member of the Ofcom Board and will not receive any remuneration in addition to his salary at Ofcom. Ms Goldwag has been appointed for up to 4 days a month - she has been a Commissioner since 2005 and has been reappointed under this competition for an additional period of up to 12 months.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared) to be made public. Mr McTighe, Ms Goldwag and Mr McIntosh have not carried out any political activities on behalf of any political party over the past five years. Norman Blackwell is a Conservative Member of the House of Lords and has carried out political activities in support of the Conservative Party. </p>

<li>Postcomm is a non-Ministerial Department created by the Postal Services Act 2000. On Wednesday 13 October 2010, the Government introduced a new Postal Services Bill and published an accompanying document setting out its vision for the postal services sector. More information about the Postal Services Bill can be found on the BIS website at the following address: (<a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/business-sectors/postal-services">http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/business-sectors/postal-services</a>). As part of the Coalition Government’s Bill, the responsibility for regulating the mail industry will transfer to Ofcom with Postcomm being subsequently abolished (subject to Parliamentary approval of the Bill). The abolition of the Postal Services Commission is also foreshadowed in the Public Bodies Bill. </li>
