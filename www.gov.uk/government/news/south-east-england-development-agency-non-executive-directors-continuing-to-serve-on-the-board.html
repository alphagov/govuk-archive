<p>Keith Riley Deputy Chair, Dr Dolores Byrne OBE and Imtiaz Farookhi will serve from 14 December until the RDA closes.</p>

<p>The Minister commented:</p>

<p>“As we move toward a new framework for our regional economies, it is important that the development agencies are equipped with the leadership to ensure the transition period is a smooth one. </p>

<p>“The skills and experience of these board members will be a valuable asset during this time and I hope they will continue to work with us to ensure an efficient evolutionary process.”</p>

<hr>
<p>Rob Douglas, Chair of SEEDA, said:</p>

<hr>
<p>“With the abolition of the RDAs now announced by the Government, it is essential that we have continuity on our Board as we take on the challenging task of transferring our functions to our various successor bodies, whether national or local.  </p>

<p>“I am delighted that my colleagues have agreed to be re-appointed. They all bring invaluable experience with them, which will help the Board provide critical support to the Executive and ensure that we help maintain the economic wellbeing of the South East during a difficult time”</p>

<p><strong>Notes to Editors</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Regional Development Agency non-executive Board member posts </li>
</ol>
<p>attract a remuneration of £8,666 per year for a minimum time commitment of two days per month.</p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>Final closure of the RDAs is likely to be completed by 31 March 2012 following legislation. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RDAs are business led organisations, promoting and co-ordinating economic growth and development, enterprise and regeneration. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Coalition Government has made the decision to support the </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>creation of local enterprise partnerships to replace RDAs.  On that basis the decision was made not to continue with further Board member recruitment.  The continued terms are necessary to ensure that the RDA Chairs are able effectively to manage their Board membership up until closure, and that membership does not fall below the minimum requirement of eight, as stated in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. </p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>The original appointments were made following open competition in accordance with the requirement set down in the Commissioner for Public Appointments Code of Practice.  All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process.  However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared) to be made public.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keith Riley, Dolores Byrne and Imtiaz Farookhi have not declared any political activity undertaken during the past five years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imtiaz Farookhi holds a further ministerial appointment as Board member of the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation, chairing the audit and risk committee. The post attracts remuneration of around £20k per annum for a time commitment of two days a month.  Keith Riley and Dolores Byrne do not hold any further ministerial public appointments.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
