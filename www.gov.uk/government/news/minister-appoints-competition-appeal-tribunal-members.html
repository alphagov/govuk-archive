<p>Consumer Minister Edward Davey said:</p>

<p>“The members I am appointing today represent a range of expertise, gained at the highest levels of business, academia, the law and other fields. They will help ensure the continued authority and effectiveness of the Tribunal.”</p>

<p>Cases are heard before a Tribunal consisting of three members: either the President or a member of the panel of chairmen, who are judicial appointments, and two ordinary members. </p>

<p>The ordinary members are selected for their expertise in law, business, accountancy, economics and other related fields.</p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>

<hr>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>The new members have all been appointed for four years automatically renewable for a further four years, and will be paid according to the amount of time that they spend working for the Tribunal, based on a daily rate of £350. The appointments carry no right of pension, gratuity or allowance on its termination. The appointments will commence on 4 January 2011.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
    <p>All appointments are made on merit, and political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity to be made public. None of the new members are politically active.   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although these appointments do not come within the remit of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA), they have been made following OCPA best practice.</p>
