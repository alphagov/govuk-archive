<p>With over 4,000 businesses already signed up, the British Business Club will be at the heart of this, providing a free online business guide to the Games for those wanting to make the most of this opportunity.  </p>

<p>The British Business Club is a unique online network, created by UK Trade &amp; Investment, London &amp; Partners, the London Business Network, and the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, to enable businesses to connect with business partners across the world, arrange one-to-one meetings, find the go-to business events across the UK and promote their business capability &amp; skills.  </p>

<p>The British Business Club enables companies of all sizes to network free of charge with thousands of other businesses to showcase their expertise and know-how by creating an online profile. The website - <a rel="external" href="http://www.britishbusinessclub.org/">www.britishbusinessclub.org</a> - will also provide access to one-to-one meetings, networking events and free temporary membership of the Institute of Directors in London for the duration of the Games to encourage and build upon business connections in the UK and overseas.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, a one-to-one marketing tool will be launched at the start of next week to coincide with the start of the arrival of country delegations to London.  </p>

<p>President of the British Business Club, Sir John Armitt, said:  </p>

<p>“The British Business Club offers a unique networking tool for UK businesses to capitalise on their involvement in the Olympic Games, particularly in terms of securing work on other major sports events - a fast-growing sector that is creating many new opportunities. British companies, big and small, now have precious experience that they can use to win business at home and abroad. They are already doing so in Sochi, host city of the next Winter Olympic Games, and Brazil, where the next football World Cup and summer Olympic Games will be staged.”  </p>

<p>Minister for Trade and Investment, Lord Green, said:  </p>

<p>“The 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to showcase all that is great about Britain and British businesses to the world. Through the British Business Club, UK companies can use the excitement generated by the world’s greatest sporting festival to seek out new clients across the globe. It’s a key part of our plan to make sure we realise a business legacy for companies up and down our country from these Games.”  </p>

<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said:  </p>

<p>“The eyes of the world are on London this summer and I am determined to ensure we grasp the golden opportunities this presents. We are pleased to host British Business Club members as part of our ambitious plans to bang the drum for London, showing why this city is the pre-eminent global business destination.”  </p>

    <p>The Government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries.’ It set four ambitions in the <a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf">‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)</a>, published at Budget 2011:</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
    <p>To create the most competitive tax system in the G20</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Work is underway across Government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the Government wants the economy to travel.  </p>
