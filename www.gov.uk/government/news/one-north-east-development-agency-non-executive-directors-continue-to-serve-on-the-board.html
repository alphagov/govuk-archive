<p>Graham Thrower, Prof Chris Higgins, Gill Hale, Ian Dormer, Alison Thain OBE, Ian Brown and Bob Symonds will serve from 14 December 2010 until the RDA closes.</p>

<p>The Minister commented:</p>

<hr>
<p>“As we move toward a new framework for our regional economies, it is important that the development agencies are equipped with the leadership to ensure the transition period is a smooth one. </p>

<p>“The skills and experience of these board members will be a valuable asset during this time and I hope they will continue to work with us to ensure an efficient evolutionary process.”</p>

<hr>
<p>Margaret Fay ONE North East Chairman said:</p>

<p>“These Board members have all brought a wealth of experience, energy and focus to the board of One North East and I am delighted that they have agreed to continue to work alongside the new Chairman Paul Callaghan during this critical time for the region.</p>

<p>“The Board has been a major force behind the Agency’s progress driving the economic development of the region and the experience of the retained members will be invaluable in the challenging times ahead for One North East.”</p>

<p><strong>Notes to Editors</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Regional Development Agency non-executive Board member posts </li>
</ol>
<p>attract a remuneration of £8,666 per year for a minimum time commitment of two days per month.</p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>The continued terms are up until the RDA closes.  Final closure of RDAs is likely to be completed by 31 March 2012 following legislation. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RDAs are business led organisations, promoting and co-ordinating </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>economic growth and development, enterprise and regeneration. </p>

<ol>
<li>The Coalition Government has made the decision to support the </li>
</ol>
<p>creation of local enterprise partnerships to replace RDAs.  On that basis the decision was made not to continue with further Board member recruitment.  The continued terms are necessary to ensure that the RDA Chairs are able to effectively manage their Board membership up until closure, and that membership does not fall below the minimum requirement of eight, as stated in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. </p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>The original appointments were made following open competition in accordance with the requirement set down in the Commissioner for Public Appointments Code of Practice.  All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process.  However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared) to be made public.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graham Thrower, Prof Chris Higgins, Ian Dormer, Alison Thain, Ian Brown have not declared any political activity undertaken during the past five years. Gill Hale is an active member of the Labour Party, Bob Symonds is an active member of the Labour Party and was a Local Councillor until May 2010.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prof Chris Higgins is the Chair of SEAC which attracts a remuneration of c.£600 for a time commitment of 10 days a year.  Ian Brown is on the Environment Agency Regional Environment Protection Advisory Committee - Northeast/Yorks’ Humber which attracts a remuneration of £17,641 a year for a time commitment of 5 days a month.  Graham Thrower, Gill Hale, Ian Dormer, Alison Thain, Bob Symonds do not hold any further ministerial public appointments.</p>
