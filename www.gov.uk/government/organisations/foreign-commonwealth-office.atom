    <title>Foreign Office minister condemns new settlement</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>FCO Minister Alistair Burt statement: the approval of new units is a 'provocative action' contrary to Fourth Geneva Convention.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the announcements on 24 December that the Jerusalem District Planning Board issued approval for 1242 units in Mordot Gilo South, and that Ariel College is to be upgraded to university status thereby creating the first university in a settlement illegal under international law, Alistair Burt, Minister for the Middle East said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last week Foreign Secretary William Hague made clear our condemnation and deep disappointment at the approval of the East Jerusalem Ramat Shlomo plan. We also condemn the Jerusalem District Planning Board’s approvals for over 3150 units in Givaat Hamatos and 1242 units in Mordot Gilo South. These are further profoundly provocative actions that run contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention. By taking these steps, despite the international community repeatedly raising our profound concerns, the Israeli Government is damaging Israel’s international reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are also deeply disappointed in the decision to upgrade Ariel’s university centre. Ariel is beyond the Green Line in a settlement that is illegal according to international law. This decision will deepen the presence of the settlements in the Palestinian territories and will create another obstacle to peace. We reiterate our call on Israel urgently to reverse these decisions and take no further steps aimed at expanding or entrenching settlement activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I spoke with President Abbas last week I expressed our appreciation for the measured response the Palestinian Leadership had been taking in response to Israel’s recent settlement announcements.  We utterly and unreservedly condemn the recent call for a third intifada and a suicide campaign by a Hamas official. Incitements to violence and terror are unacceptable. We welcome that President Abbas has publicly rejected the recent inflammatory statements by Hamas leaders, and that he has stated clearly the position of the legitimate Palestinian Leadership which has accepted the State of Israel in 1967 borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taken together, these further settlement announcements and comments deepen our worry for the region at such a crucial time, and demonstrate why we are convinced of the urgency for more positive indicators of change. Accordingly we continue to call on President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu to show the strong leadership needed to achieve a return to negotiations for a two-state solution, which will bring a just and permanent solution to this conflict.  We repeat our hope that 2013 will be the ‘year of peace’ for Palestinians, Israelis and all people of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCO Minister appalled by killing of civilians at bakery in Syria</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt condemns shelling that killed over 60 people queuing for bread at a bakery in Halfaya, Syria .</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on reports of shelling which reportedly killed more than 60 people queuing for bread at a bakery in Halfaya, the Foreign Office Minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am appalled by emerging reports of the brutal shelling and killing of civilians in Halfaya in Hama province yesterday. Opposition groups report that over 60 people were killed while queuing for bread with more believed to be buried in the rubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If verified, this would be the most recent in a long line of human rights violations and abuses committed by the Syrian regime, which continues to wage a remorseless war against its own people. The attack highlights the urgent need for a political transition and end to the violence, and for those responsible for these appalling acts to be held to account.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCO Minister Baroness Warsi statement on the murder of Bashir Ahmed Bilour</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Senior Minister of State Baroness Warsi expresses her sadness at the murder of Pakistani minister Bashir Ahmed Bilour on Saturday.
 </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was deeply saddened to hear of the death of Bashir Ahmed Bilour and my thoughts are with his family and friends and those of the others killed and wounded in this vicious attack, an attack which I and the UK Government utterly condemns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mr Bilour was a courageous and vocal opponent of extremism and refused to be silenced by those who threatened him.  His absence will be felt keenly in Pakistani politics. His enduring legacy will be the many people he inspired to speak out against terror and work to build a peaceful, democratic society for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU puts Iran sanctions into law</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt comments following the EU's formal implementation of additional sanctions against Iran.

</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the EU adopted the regulation that translates Iran sanctions agreed by the Foreign Affairs Council in October into law.  These include a prohibition on financial transactions with Iranian financial institutions and further trade restrictions in key sectors like energy and metals, from which Iran derives funds and materials for its proliferation activities.  The UK played a leading role in the negotiation of the regulation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting today, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Alistair Burt, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The adoption of a tough EU regulation on Iran sanctions should send a clear message to the Iranian Government that the pressure will only increase until it takes concrete actions to address the international community’s serious concerns about its nuclear programme. Iran continues to enrich uranium on a scale that has no plausible civilian justification, in contravention of international law. The EU’s move follows the decision taken yesterday by the United Nations Security Council to designate two Iranian companies caught red-handed trying to supply arms to the brutal Syrian regime. This continued support for Assad’s efforts to suppress the people of Syria undermines peace and security in the Middle East, and shows the contempt with which the Iranian authorities treat international law and the concerns of the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The E3+3 wants to reach a diplomatic solution with Iran on the nuclear issue, but Iran needs to co-operate. We hope that political talks with Iran can begin again in the New Year, based on mutual respect, but clear in the need for an urgent solution to this issue. Time for a diplomatic solution is not open-ended. Iran’s leaders have a clear choice: work with the international community on a diplomatic agreement which addresses our concerns and which would bring significant benefits to Iran. Or continue on the path of mistrust, damaging the Iranian economy and putting the peace and security of the region at risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Iran’s leaders know that sanctions are having a significant impact. They should be in no doubt that the international community will keep up the pressure until they are ready to negotiate in good faith and take the concrete steps needed to convince the international community that they are not building a nuclear weapon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humanitarian payments and goods, including food and medicines, will remain exempt from EU and UK sanctions. The UK will continue to prioritise the licensing of transactions for food and medicines. &lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minister for Africa Mark Simmonds comments following renewed outbreak of violence in Kenya’s Tana River Delta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am shocked at the tragic news of renewed violence in the Tana River Delta area of Kenya this morning and the high casualties reported. My sympathies go to the families of those who have been killed and wounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wish to reiterate the UK government’s deep concern at this ongoing violence, which we have made clear to the Government of Kenya at the highest levels. I urge restraint on all sides and dialogue between the communities. It is imperative for the underlying grievances behind this conflict to be addressed urgently. The UK continues to support efforts towards reconciliation in Kenya.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Renewed effort needed on two-state solution for Israeli-Palestinian conflict</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt has spoken with the President of the Palestinian Authority about the need for peace in the region.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the telephone conversation with Mr Mahmoud Abbas today, Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;President Abbas and I had a productive conversation today. I reaffirmed our strong support for President Abbas, Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, and for the Palestinian Authority. We are in no doubt that President Abbas is a courageous man of peace. President Abbas and I discussed our shared profound concern at Israel’s recent settlement announcements, which the Foreign Secretary has condemned in the strongest terms. I expressed appreciation for the measured response of the Palestinian Leadership, and asked the President to engage in a renewed effort - led by the United States with full European support - to achieve a just and permanent solution to this conflict. I welcomed President Abbas’s determined commitment to maintain security co-operation in the West Bank, despite the serious financial pressures on the Palestinian Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK continues to urge both sides to show the political will and leadership needed to bring about peace and to refrain from any steps that would make the two state solution, or a return to negotiations, more difficult. We agreed that the New Year offered new opportunities to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by negotiation, and reiterated our determination to do all that we can to make next year decisive. We expressed the shared hope that 2013 will be the ‘year of peace’ for Palestinians, Israelis and all people of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>A look at the work of the Foreign Office and its embassies overseas this week. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h4 id="queen-elizabeth-land"&gt;Queen Elizabeth Land&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II visited the Foreign Office on Tuesday for the final event of her Diamond Jubilee year. The Foreign Secretary William Hague &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/her-majesty-queen-elizabeth-ii-visits-the-foreign-office" title="Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II visits the Foreign Office"&gt;paid tribute to The Queen&lt;/a&gt;, he said: “You have advanced ideals of peace, friendship, freedom and tolerance, and given on each occasion an immeasurable boost to our country’s reputation overseas.” The Foreign Secretary also announced that the southern part of the British Antarctic Territory has been named &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/queen-elizabeth-land" title=" Queen Elizabeth Land"&gt;‘Queen Elizabeth Land’&lt;/a&gt; in honour of The Queen’s sixtieth year on the throne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria report on the human rights situation in Syria concluded that innocent Syrian civilians are bearing the brunt of escalating armed confrontations between regime and opposition forces. Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said that &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/un-report-stark-reminder-of-horrific-human-rights-situation-in-syria" title="UN report stark reminder of horrific human rights situation in Syria"&gt;the UK will continue to support the Commission’s work and ensure that those responsible for these appalling crimes are held to account.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary spoke about the human rights situation in Iran, specifically the case of the Iranian human rights defender Nasrin Sotoudeh, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/iran-must-uphold-the-rights-and-freedoms-of-its-citizens" title="Iran must uphold the rights and freedoms of its citizens"&gt;addressing Ms Sotoudeh directly in a video message&lt;/a&gt; the Foreign Secretary said: “Be assured that we will continue to hold the Iranian government to account for your terrible treatment. We will not forget you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="israeli-settlements"&gt;Israeli settlements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-responds-to-planned-new-settlements" title="Foreign Secretary responds to planned new settlements"&gt;Foreign Secretary condemned Israeli plans to build 1,500 illegal housing units&lt;/a&gt;  in East Jerusalem. He said: “Settlements undermine the foundations of a two state solution and trust between the parties. This decision, which paves the way for the extension of settlements in East Jerusalem, constitutes a serious provocation and an obstacle to peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="tibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire gave a statement about &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-has-serious-concerns-about-human-rights-in-tibet" title="Human rights in Tibet"&gt;self-immolations and human rights in Tibet&lt;/a&gt;. He said that a long term solution is best achieved through respect for universal principles of human rights and genuine autonomy for Tibet within the framework of the Chinese constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="british-diplomacy-today"&gt;British diplomacy today&lt;/h4&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office launched the Prosperity Fund in April 2011 to tackle climate change, strengthen energy security and promote an open global economy in key emerging economies.

    <title>Human Rights and Democracy Programme</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>The Human Rights and Democracy Programme is the Foreign and Commonwealth’s fund supporting human rights and democracy work overseas.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Human Rights and Democracy Programme (&lt;abbr title="Human Rights and Democracy Programme"&gt;HRDP&lt;/abbr&gt;) is the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s  (&lt;abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt;) fund supporting human rights and democracy work overseas. The Programme aims to make a difference to people’s lives, helping to build the capacity of governments and civil society to promote and protect human rights. In 2012/13, we supported over 70 projects worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are at the heart of the government’s foreign policy. The &lt;abbr title="Human Rights and Democracy Programme"&gt;HRDP&lt;/abbr&gt; concentrates on areas that are both important to us and where we consider we can best achieve the &lt;abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s central goal to “pursue an active and activist foreign policy, working with other countries and strengthening the rules-based international system in support of our values”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="programme"&gt;2013/14 Programme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the 2013/14 call for bids. The main areas for 2013/14 are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;global torture prevention &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;abolition of the death penalty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promotion and protection of freedom of expression &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;upholding freedom of religion and belief &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;combating discrimination against women &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;business and human rights &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strengthening democratic processes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of funding will be allocated to priority countries. However, we do accept bids from countries not on this list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects in individual countries overseas must have the support of the British Embassy or High Commission in the country and must support the priorities of that Mission.  The &lt;abbr title="Human Rights and Democracy Programme"&gt;HRDP&lt;/abbr&gt; team in London will not accept proposals submitted directly to us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-to-apply"&gt;How to apply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Human Rights and Democracy Programme"&gt;HRDP&lt;/abbr&gt; is a strategic programme and we assess every bid we receive very carefully to ensure it will achieve its goals and that it fits with both the &lt;abbr title="Human Rights and Democracy Programme"&gt;HRDP&lt;/abbr&gt; strategy and our local human rights strategy for the relevant country. Projects in individual countries must have the support of the British Embassy or High Commission in the country and you should work with them early on in the process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bids are also assessed against the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Value for money - Proposals must be supported by a realistic activity based budget, set out with as much detail as possible. Budgets should be broken down so that it is clear how estimates were calculated.  This is a central requirement in evaluating the project proposal and insufficient budget detail was among the top reasons why projects were rejected in 2012. An example budget is included at Annex A.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evidence of local demand/need – We are particularly interested in funding new or innovative work, which, if successful, could be expanded into a wider project benefiting other funds or be self-sustaining. If relevant, you should set out how the proposal adds value to previous work undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project viability, including capacity of implementing organisation(s) - Projects should be realistic in the results they aim to achieve and how these will contribute to the long-term achievement of the targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project design, including clear, achievable impact  - Projects must deliver outputs and outcomes relevant to this programme’s targets. It is vital that projects that clearly demonstrate how they will address the target areas and deliver impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustainability - To increase the long-term sustainability of projects and their impact, we want to maximise opportunities to support local civil society.  This might mean working through a national non-governmental organisation (&lt;abbr title="non-governmental organisation"&gt;NGO&lt;/abbr&gt;) to deliver a project, or using an international &lt;abbr title="non-governmental organisation"&gt;NGO&lt;/abbr&gt; to support the work of a network of local NGOs.  When working with international partners, the focus should be on building skills of local partners to continue the work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Risk and stakeholder management – Risks should be identified and a risk management plan put in place. Proposals should demonstrate how they would engage host governments and main stakeholders. Projects that can enhance host government support or engagement are more likely to succeed. However, we will continue to support work that challenges host country views, and we do not believe that change is impossible without host government support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="projects"&gt;Projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects should begin from June 2013 and must be completed by end February 2014. We will fund projects up to a value of £200,000.  Projects in excess of that amount may be considered exceptionally.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will have limited funds for projects that extend into 2014/15 and therefore can fund a small number of projects that extend up to February 2015, although the amount allocated per financial year is fixed. The amount allocated to each financial year will be fixed and unspent funds from one year cannot be transferred to the next. At least 70% of funds will be allocated to projects that are completed in 2013/14 and these projects will have a higher chance of being funded.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deadline is subject to local conditions and may be earlier in the year so you must check with the local Mission for their exact date. It is our aim to inform all successful and unsuccessful project implementers by the end of April 2013, but this depends on full information from implementers being included in the bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="contact-details"&gt;Contact details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All general queries relating to the programme should be direct to &lt;a href="mailto:HRDPF.Applications@fco.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Human Rights and Democracy Programme"&gt;HRDP&lt;/abbr&gt; Team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

I look forward to working with the community and their elected representatives for a secure and prosperous future.&lt;/p&gt;
