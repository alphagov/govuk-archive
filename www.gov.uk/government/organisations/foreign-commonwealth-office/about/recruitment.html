          Our careers for generalist and specialist staff: recruitment policy, vacancies, work experience and internship schemes
        </p>
        <div class="body">
          <div class="govspeak">
<p>The FCO is the UK government department responsible for protecting and promoting British interests around the world, through the FCO in London and our network of 270 diplomatic posts in 160 countries around the world. </p>

<p>We employ a diverse range of talented people capable of delivering to a high standard, often under pressure or in difficult places. In return, we guarantee a fascinating, personally rewarding career at the centre of world events. The FCO regularly scores highly in surveys of “employers graduates would most like to work for”. For example, we are currently ranked 13th out of the top 300 <a rel="external" href="http://targetjobs.co.uk/uk300">most popular graduate employers.</a> In our most recent entry to the Stonewall Workplace Equality index (2011), we ranked 16th out of the top 100 LGBT-friendly employers.</p>

<p>We want the modern FCO to reflect the very best of 21st century Britain and encourage applications from all suitably qualified applicants irrespective of personal background or circumstances. All appointments to the FCO are made through open and fair competition, in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the <a rel="external" href="http://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk/civil-service-recruitment/">Civil Service Commission.</a> </p>

<h2 id="our-staff">Our staff</h2>

<p>The FCO employs around 14,000 staff around the world. Roughly one third are UK-based British Civil Servants whose career typically includes work in the UK and postings overseas; and around two thirds are Locally Engaged (LE) staff, employed by a British Diplomatic Post overseas (such as an Embassy, High Commission, or Consulate). Applicants for LE roles should be based in that country and usually will need to be able to work in the main local language. For information on our Locally Engaged vacancies, please visit the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/find-an-embassy/">web pages for our overseas Posts.</a>   </p>

<h2 id="recruitment-policy-generalists-and-specialists">Recruitment Policy: Generalists and Specialists</h2>

<p>Recruitment into the FCO’s UK-based workforce is normally either as a generalist (ie. into the Diplomatic or Home Civil Service cadres where staff rotate between a variety of roles, including many overseas), or as a Specialist (i.e. taking up a specific role requiring specialist skills). The Civil Service-wide recruitment freeze introduced in May 2010 limits new appointments to frontline and business-critical jobs only, which normally means specialist roles. The only FCO generalist recruitment currently permitted under the freeze is via the <a rel="external" href="http://faststream.civilservice.gov.uk/">Civil Service Fast Stream.</a> Any specialist vacancies will be advertised on this page.    </p>

<h2 id="vacancies">Vacancies</h2>

<p>All vacancies into our UK-based workforce are advertised well in advance here. You may also like to check out the <a rel="external" href="https://jobsstatic.civilservice.gov.uk/csjobs.html/">Civil Service Jobs website</a>  </p>

</section><h2 id="work-experience">Work experience</h2>

<p>The FCO aims to recruit a talented and diverse workforce which reflects the society we serve. In order to generate interest in FCO careers from a broader applicant base, the FCO offers a range of work experience opportunities each year. We hope that by giving individuals from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to experience life at the FCO, they may consider the FCO as a future employer, as well as gaining beneficial work experience. Our work experience opportunities, which are paid, are therefore focussed on individuals from backgrounds that are currently under-represented in our workforce, and on those who bring skills which we require to achieve our objectives (for 2012, these skills were hard languages and economics). All work experience placements are awarded strictly on merit, after a competitive application process. In order to ensure our opportunities are accessible to all those who are eligible, we do not offer any work experience opportunities to individuals on an ad-hoc basis and cannot accept speculative applications. </p>

<p>All of our work experience schemes are centrally run by either the FCO or other government departments (such as the Cabinet Office/Fast Stream, DWP, and BIS). We launch our annual programme of schemes in Spring each year, when we will publish details of the schemes on this page. You can also follow us on Twitter, follow us on Facebook, Linked In or sign up to our RSS feeds.  </p>

<p>It is important to note that the FCO’s external recruitment campaigns are run separately from any work experience or internship scheme: work experience does not in any way guarantee future employment with the FCO. Our recruitment for permanent employment is merit-based and through fair and open competition, as set out by the Civil Service Commission. Interns do not receive any preferential treatment in the selection processes.</p>

<h3 id="fco-internship-schemes-in-2012">FCO Internship Schemes in 2012</h3>
<p>In 2012 we significantly increased our work experience schemes, in order to meet our diversity and workforce objectives. Our 2012 programme featured the following schemes: </p>
