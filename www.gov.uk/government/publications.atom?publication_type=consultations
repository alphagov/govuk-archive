    <title>Firefighters' pension scheme: increases to employee contribution rates from 1 April 2013</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statutory consultation seeks views on the proposed increase in employee contribution rates from 1 April 2013 for members of the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (1992) and New Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has also considered the impact of the proposed 2013 to 2014 pension contribution increases on protected groups (like older scheme members, those on maternity leave or part time workers) and this is set out in the partial equality statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Amendments to the new firefighters' pension scheme 2006: automatic enrolment</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation covers amendments to the new firefighters’ pension scheme, as set out in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/3432/made"&gt;Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (England) Order 2006&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is so that fire and rescue authorities can comply with their duties for automatic enrolment under workplace pension reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received 13 responses to the consultation and summary of responses is available above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Approving drink-drive rehabilitation courses</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation is about updating the arrangements for providing training courses under the drink-drive rehabilitation scheme, including how they’re funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals build on the government policy in the ‘Strategic framework for road safety’ by providing improved education for convicted drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is that these proposals will: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create better quality courses which will encourage more offenders to take training and reduce the likelihood of them reoffending&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make sure that courses are available in every part of the country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make sure that courses are of the same standard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allow the Driving Standards Agency to take action against trainers not providing courses as they should&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="decisions"&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new scheme will make sure that courses are available in every part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monitor course providers to make sure that courses are all of the same standard – we’ll charge fees to cover our costs for doing this&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take action against course providers who are not up to standard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give course providers the right to appeal if their application is refused or if we remove their course approval&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give existing course providers enough time to move over to the new scheme, if that’s what they want to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;let course providers use first or second class post for sending out notices to offenders, as long as they get a receipt of posting and keep it for their records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training providers can decide the cost of the course, but it can’t cost more than £250.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="important-dates"&gt;Important dates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;What’s happening&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Invitations to apply issued&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7 January 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Closing date for receipt of applications&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8 February 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;New courses start&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;24 June 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Approval of existing courses runs out&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;18 August 2013&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

    <title>Speed limit exemptions</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes that section 19 of the Road Safety Act (2006) be brought into effect. This would replace section 87 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act (1984) in relation to exemptions from speed limits for certain vehicle purposes. Regulations are needed to bring it into effect and set out the detail of how it would work. This document contains the department’s proposed approach to implementing the regulations in Section 19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes would have two major effects. Firstly it will allow certain other vehicle purposes to be included in speed limit exemption regulations. Secondly it will prescribe a high speed training course that drivers must undertake (or be in the process of taking) before they are permitted to exceed speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation document also considers regulations related to 5 other exemptions from road traffic laws (related to signals, signalled crossings, certain signs and motorway hard shoulders) It includes proposals to amend some of these other provisions at the same time that section 19 is commenced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document will also seek views about the planned introduction of a further exemption from seat belt requirements related to the treatment of patients in the back of ambulances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Rail decentralisation: devolving decision-making on passenger rail services in England</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most train services in England are specified, funded and managed centrally by the Department for Transport based in London. Passenger Transport Executives’ (&lt;abbr title="Passenger Transport Executives"&gt;PTEs&lt;/abbr&gt;) and local authorities’ influence over the rail services provided in their local area is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with its aspirations for localism, the government is seeking to devolve, where appropriate, more accountability and decision-making related to local rail services to sub-national bodies, such as local authorities and &lt;abbr title="Passenger Transport Executives"&gt;PTEs&lt;/abbr&gt;. This consultation explores how this might be done in parts of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="why-we-are-consulting"&gt;Why we are consulting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wishes to seek views on whether improved outcomes for transport users might be achieved in some cases if more decisions relating to local rail services were made closer to the communities they serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also inviting sub-national bodies - &lt;abbr title="Passenger Transport Executives"&gt;PTEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and local authorities - to indicate their interest and come forward with outline proposals for taking on decision-making responsibility for passenger rail services in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation complements the command paper, ‘Reforming our railways’, published today. That sets out the government’s vision for rail and responds to Sir Roy McNulty’s independent report on value for money on the railways.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nationally significant infrastructure planning: expanding and improving the ‘one stop shop’ approach for consents</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 6 September 2012, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister set out a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-boost-british-housebuilding-jobs-and-the-economy"&gt;major package of reforms to housing and planning&lt;/a&gt; to help create conditions for economic growth. This announcement included a commitment to ‘work to extend the principle of a one-stop-shop for non-planning consents for major infrastructure’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this consultation is to seek views from interested bodies on what consents should be moved within the scope of an expanded ‘one stop shop’ for major infrastructure and on proposals for streamlining the current list of statutory consultees that developers are required to consult before applying for a development consent order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate consultation we are seeking views on proposals to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/nationally-significant-infrastructure-planning-extending-the-regime-to-business-and-commercial-projects"&gt;extend the nationally significant infrastructure planning regime to business and commercial projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Nationally significant infrastructure planning: extending the regime to business and commercial projects</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help speed up planning decisions for the most complex projects and to increase choice for developers, the government proposes to extend the scope of the Planning Act 2008 so that a wider range of development can be brought within the nationally significant infrastructure planning regime. This will allow developers of nationally significant business or commercial projects to apply to the Secretary of State for the option of using the streamlined planning regime set out in the Planning Act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views about the proposal to extend the nationally significant infrastructure regime and, in particular, about the types and forms of business and commercial projects to be prescribed in regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate consultation we are seeking views on proposals to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/nationally-significant-infrastructure-planning-expanding-and-improving-the-one-stop-shop-approach-for-consents"&gt;expand and improve the ‘one stop shop’ approach for consents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;It seeks views on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the government’s proposals for providing certainty for the funding of local precepting authorities&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>A better deal for mobile home owners</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes a number of reforms to the park homes sector, aimed at tackling a number of complaints made by residents of some mobile home site operators. These can include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking an owner’s sale of their home - without justifiable reason&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neglecting their sites and failing to make adequate repairs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;charging excessive pitch fees, breaching site rules and stopping owners from improving their homes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures are designed to ensure site operators who behave responsibly can continue to operate as they do already whilst the rogue operators are properly tackled - as well as being made to meet the cost of their negligence rather than the taxpayer picking up the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring compliance with site licence conditions by enabling the courts to impose unlimited fines on operators who do not manage their sites properly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allowing local authorities to make a reasonable charge on site operators for their licensing services, which they are currently unable to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving local authorities the power to carry out works on sites in an emergency or where the site operator has been found guilty of a breach of the licence, and charge the cost back to them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strengthening the rules around the sale of mobile homes so that unscrupulous operators cannot interfere with owners selling to a qualifying buyer who they have chosen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changing legislation to improve other residents’ rights to reflect their status as home owners by, for example, allowing them to carry out home improvements without seeking permission&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Enforcement procedures against drink drivers and other offenders</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation encompasses the legislative changes the government proposed in its response of March 2011 to the reports by Sir Peter North and the Transport Select Committee on drink and drug driving (“the Government’s response”). The changes covered in this consultation do not, however, include creating a new offence related to driving with a specified impairing drug in the body, which is also being progressed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed legislative changes relate to Great Britain (and not to Northern Ireland) and will be implemented subject to the outcome of this consultation and the securing of legislative time. The proposals are consistent with the devolution of the drink drive limit in Scotland, through the Scotland Act 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation seeks views about proceeding with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the withdrawal of the ‘statutory option’;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes as to when preliminary breath tests are needed;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes to the testing procedures in hospital;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes to who can assess whether someone is under the influence of drugs; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;amendments to the regimes for aviation, rail and shipping which mirror the road regime.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Technical reforms to Council Tax: when dwellings should not be liable to the empty homes premium</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/17/introduction/enacted"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 2012&lt;/a&gt; allows a billing authority to charge an empty homes premium to provide a stronger incentive to get homes back into productive use and remove the blight of such properties on local neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium was subject to a consultation, ‘&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/technical-reforms-of-council-tax"&gt;Technical Reforms to Council Tax&lt;/a&gt;’, which ended on 29 December 2011. The government published its response on 28 May 2012, which confirmed its intention to proceed with the premium and stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will not be payable until a dwelling has been empty and unfurnished for 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the maximum premium that an authority will be able to charge will be 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation invited views on the government’s proposals on exceptions to the premium: dwellings which may otherwise be liable for the premium, but which are subject to circumstances that mean that it would not be appropriate for it to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summary of responses was published on 21 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;This report succeeds the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919194311/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/revocationwmrss"&gt;previous environmental report&lt;/a&gt; on the revocation of the West Midlands regional strategy which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012. It is a stand alone document the intention of which is to provide the reader with an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of the revocation of the West Midlands Plan and the regional economic strategy without the need to refer back to the previous environmental report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Targeted consultation on a proposed amendment to the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 (as amended) - civil penalties</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (&lt;abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation"&gt;RTFO&lt;/abbr&gt;) scheme requires suppliers of road transport fuel to ensure that a certain proportion of the fuel they supply comes from sustainable renewable sources. To ensure effective enforcement of the scheme the &lt;abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation"&gt;RTFO&lt;/abbr&gt; administrator has powers to issue civil penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is proposing to amend the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 to put it beyond doubt that civil penalties issued under the scheme are enforceable as civil debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Channel Tunnel: transposition of railway safety and interoperability directives</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are currently seeking views on whether to transpose the requirements of 3 European directives on railway safety and interoperability so that these provisions are in force for the Channel Tunnel. In recognition of the Tunnel’s cross-border nature these we would like to incorporate the provisions of these railway safety and interoperability directives by making amendments to the Channel Tunnel (Safety) Order 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Removal of motor insurance certificates</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on amending the Road Traffic Act 1988 to remove the need for insurers to issue a motor insurance certificate when an insurance policy is taken out. At present the certificate is used as evidence of valid insurance cover and there are circumstances when it must be produced by the insured to demonstrate they have valid cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurers are required by law to enter details of all motor insurance policies onto the motor insurance database (&lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt;). This consultation document considers using the &lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt; as the single source for checking if insurance cover is in place and considers what further changes and developments are needed to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
