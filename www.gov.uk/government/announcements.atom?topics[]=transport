    <title>Driving this New Year's Eve? Try a mocktail</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Department for Transport has produced a number of non-alcoholic cocktail recipes to help designated drivers celebrate in style.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport is encouraging drivers to opt for non alcoholic ‘mocktails’ in a bid to cut down on drink driving this New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has produced a number of recipes – from a Berry Breezer to a Piña Banana – to appeal to those who are designated drivers on nights out.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department is also warning party-goers to plan their way home in advance so they can celebrate the New Year in style, not in the cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hard-hitting television advert highlighting the consequences of drink driving has been shown throughout December as part of the Department for Transport’s THINK! drink drive campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our message is clear: have a great New Year’s Eve, don’t risk the consequences of drink driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you get behind the wheel after drinking you risk losing your licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2011, 280 people were killed in accidents where the driver was over the limit. Do not let 1 selfish and foolish decision ruin your or another family’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, drivers aged between 20 and 24 failed more breath tests than any other age group. This year’s THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign is aimed at young people who are shown to be consistently over-represented in drink drive casualty figures. THINK! advises planning your journey home well in advance and treating your designated driver to a non-alcoholic Christmas cocktail. The recipes are easy to make at home and provide a festive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport is currently consulting on a package of tough measures to crack down on drink drivers. This includes removing drink drivers’ rights to demand a blood or urine test. This is because evidence shows it is used as a delaying tactic by drivers caught over the limit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has also supported Coke’s designated driver scheme, which offered buy 1 get 1 free soft drinks in pubs around the country throughout December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACPO lead for roads policing, Deputy Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Millions of people will be heading out for New Year’s Eve celebrations and we would ask the public to play their part in remaining safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have seen hundreds of people die from drink driving this year and it has to stop. Innocent people are needlessly dying on our roads and people who make the decision to drive after taking alcohol or drugs are responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you are someone who drinks and drives, by making a decision to stop in 2013 could save someone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is provisionally estimated that 2011 saw 280 deaths, 1,290 serious injuries and 9,990 total casualties directly related to drink driving incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign budget totals £783,925&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Clear-up initiative saving economy millions by reopening roads quicker</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>An initiative to improve incident clear-up times is saving the economy tens of millions of pounds annually.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorists and the economy are seeing huge benefits from a government-led initiative to reopen motorways and roads quickly following major incidents, Roads Minister Stephen Hammond announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘&lt;abbr title="Collision, Lead, Evaluate, Act and Reopen"&gt;CLEAR&lt;/abbr&gt;’ (collision, lead, evaluate, act and reopen) initiative - launched by the Department for Transport (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;) last year to improve incident clear-up times – is helping to save the economy tens of millions of pounds annually, with even more savings to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key achievement has been the success of 38 &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;/police-funded 3D laser scanners which allow police forces to capture evidence quickly following collisions - helping to reopen major roads and motorways more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest figures show an average time saving of 44 minutes per investigation – a 5 minute improvement on test estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other initiatives include the launch of a new hands-free smart phone app that notifies users of incidents and congestion, as well as the planned roll out of incident screens to shield collisions and prevent rubber necking. Time savings associated with screens alone can be up to several hundred thousand pounds per incident.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is confident these measures will help reduce the estimated £750 million cost to the economy that incidents cause on the strategic road network in England annually.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Minister Stephen Hammond said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is nothing more frustrating than being stuck in a traffic jam for hours on end.  There is also the shocking cost of those lost hours for our economy. That is why we are improving the clear-up of incidents so we can get our motorways and major roads re-opened as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are now witnessing even greater than expected time savings as a result of the roll out of laser scanning programme. This and other elements of the initiative, such as the use of incident screens, will help to keep traffic moving and save the economy tens of millions of pounds a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am very encouraged by the cooperation shown by the Highways Agency, &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt;, the Police and other emergency services, and fully expect these initiatives to result in further time and cost savings in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assistant Chief Constable Sean White, lead on collision investigations for the Association of Chief Police Officers (&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;), said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This equipment allows police to manage critical events in a more efficient way and present the most accurate and detailed evidence to criminal, civil and coroners’ courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The time saved by using this technology is more economically friendly and reduces disruption on the roads, while allowing for thorough investigations to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is encouraging to see the success of this equipment, which has reduced delays for road users and proved extremely important in police investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other benefits of &lt;abbr title="Collision, Lead, Evaluate, Act and Reopen"&gt;CLEAR&lt;/abbr&gt; include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; and the Highways Agency signing a memorandum of understanding to facilitate data sharing about heavy goods vehicles. Studies have shown this type of vehicle is involved in a high proportion of the longest incidents. &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; is working closely with operators to make sure problems are addressed   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the roll out by the Highways Agency of new towing equipment (load cells) to remove heavier vehicles obstructing live lanes and spill kits to clear spillages from motorway lanes. Time savings associated with the use of load cells have been estimated at several million pounds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the production and distribution of a &lt;abbr title="Collision, Lead, Evaluate, Act and Reopen"&gt;CLEAR&lt;/abbr&gt; booklet to emergency responders outlining the roles and responsibilities of key organisations involved in managing incidents on the strategic road network. The Highways Agency has also produced a film reinforcing the booklet’s messages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the revision of emergency response guidance, training and learning to take on board &lt;abbr title="Collision, Lead, Evaluate, Act and Reopen"&gt;CLEAR&lt;/abbr&gt; principles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the revision of the 2007 Road Death Investigation Manual (RDIM) – the guiding doctrine of &lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt; and the 43 police forces of England and Wales to investigate and report on collisions that have resulted in a death. This is expected to be published in early 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report which sets out the next steps of &lt;abbr title="Collision, Lead, Evaluate, Act and Reopen"&gt;CLEAR&lt;/abbr&gt; is currently being finalised for publication next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="laser-scanners"&gt;Laser scanners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laser Scanning Technology (LST) saves time by quickly making a 3D image of the whole incident scene, rather than investigators painstakingly surveying multiple sections of a scene. This digital image of the site can then be viewed on a computer screen remotely allowing investigators to take measurements of where vehicles are in relation to each other and examine other important evidence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2009, the Highways Agency carried out an independent trial of 3D laser scanning technology using results from separate trials conducted by the Metropolitan Police Service and Humberside Police. The trials found that on average using laser scanners saved a total of 39 minutes on investigation time per incident&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;38 laser scanners were funded by &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; and the Police for use by 27 police authorities at a cost of £4 million&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Latest figures relate to information compiled from incidents over 4 months from forces using them on the strategic road network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="clear"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Collision, Lead, Evaluate, Act and Reopen"&gt;CLEAR&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2010 the Police, Highways Agency, Ambulance and Fire Services, &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt;, and related sponsoring departments came together to review evidence and knowledge about the handling of motorway incidents, and to make recommendations for improvement  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/review-of-investigation-and-closure-procedures-for-motorway-incidents-preliminary-report/review-of-investigation-closure-procedures-motorway-incidents.pdf"&gt;resultant report, published in May 2011 as the ‘Review of investigation and closure procedures for motorways incidents’ (PDF, 345KB)&lt;/a&gt;, made 10 recommendations and came together as the &lt;abbr title="Collision, Lead, Evaluate, Act and Reopen"&gt;CLEAR&lt;/abbr&gt; initiative. The recommendations included further analytical work and some more immediate actions around, for example, supporting the wider roll out of laser scanning technology for the police to assist in speeding up incident investigation &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Congestion on the strategic road network is estimated to cost the economy £3 billion each year, 25% of which is caused by incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A single incident that closes a 3 lane motorway for 4 hours can cost several million pounds in lost time, and there are some 80,000 incidents that impact at least one motorway lane each year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If &lt;abbr title="Collision, Lead, Evaluate, Act and Reopen"&gt;CLEAR&lt;/abbr&gt; makes just 5% difference to the cost of congestion on the &lt;abbr title="Strategic Road Network"&gt;SRN&lt;/abbr&gt; it could save over £30 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="incident-screens"&gt;Incident screens&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 105 sets of incident screens which will be made available for use by the Highways Agency next year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each set has 30 screens which are loaded onto purpose-built trailers and can screen up to 75 metres if used end-to-end (the individual screens are approximately 2.1 by two metres high)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They cost £2.3 million with each set costing £22,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="smart-phone-app"&gt;Smart phone app&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	The Highways Agency app received 5,000 hits within the first 2 months of its launch. Further &lt;a rel="external" href="http://press.highways.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Hands-free-traffic-app-makes-Highways-Agency-data-available-to-road-users-ready-for-summer-67e24.aspx"&gt;information is available&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="spill-kits"&gt;Spill kits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Highways Agency"&gt;HA&lt;/abbr&gt; traffic officers will be equipped with spill kits to clear up small spillages such as fuel or other fluids which leak onto the carriageways from vehicles. The spill kits will absorb small spills and will allow the road to be safely re-opened while reducing damage to the carriageway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="load-cells"&gt;Load Cells&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load cells will be fitted to the tow straps used by traffic officers and will allow them to clear live lanes - moving heavier or damaged vehicles to the nearest place of safety.  The load cell acts as a strain gauge and will ensure that the safe towing load is not exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Department for Transport's boost to train builders</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New train carriages procured by Southern Railway. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Train builders have received a year-end boost as the government announces its backing for two new train orders, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of government support, Southern Railway has now procured 40 new carriages from Bombardier based in Derby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 40 carriages, the government is also supporting Southern’s tendering process for 116 new electric carriages with the option for a further 140.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick McLoughlin said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our support for Southern will not only boost capacity but help secure British jobs. The deal for the 40 new carriages, helped along by my department, demonstrates the government’s ongoing commitment to invest in Britain’s railways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My officials are working with Southern to accelerate their procurement process for up to 256 carriages because our ambitious electrification plans requires additional rolling stock on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2011 Southern Railway, with government support, announced its plans to buy 130 carriages from Bombardier to run on services in south London, Surrey, Sussex and Kent. Southern expects these will be in service by December 2013. As part of this deal Southern had the option to buy the additional 40 carriages at a later stage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July the government announced the biggest programme of rail modernisation since the Victorian era. At the heart of the scheme was the electrification of the Midland Main Line, from London to Sheffield, with additional spurs linking it to the Great Western Main Line and the Port of Southampton.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Southern progresses with the procurement, these 116 new vehicles, and potentially 140 more, could initially be used on the Thameslink routes. Once the expected new Thameslink trains are operational these carriages will be moved to the newly electrified routes, which could include the Midland Main Line to Corby and North Transpennine Routes.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government secures free travel for London Midland passengers</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A £7 million package of benefits for rail passengers who suffered cancelled services and delays.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail passengers who suffered cancelled services and delays last year will receive free travel passes and cheap tickets thanks to tough action taken by the government, Transport Minister Norman Baker announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London Midland season ticket holders will be given 5 days worth of free travel passes under a £7 million package of benefits. The government has also secured 500,000 additional cheap advance tickets for passengers on key network routes serving London, Birmingham, Northampton, Crewe and Liverpool and a commitment to invest in infrastructure improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“London Midland has cancelled or delayed hundreds of services in recent months. On repeated occasions, they were not able to provide enough drivers and some services had to be cancelled, with severe delays to services, and they have fallen short both of everyone’s expectations and their franchise obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Securing these benefits for passengers represents a firm yellow-card for London Midland and some financial benefit for those who have been hardest hit by their poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am confident London Midland has now rectified their driver shortage but the company need to be clear that we will continue to monitor their performance closely and take firmer action if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free tickets will be available to all monthly and annual season ticket holders, as well as to weekly ticket holders who have been affected by disruption, while the additional Advance tickets will be available over the next two years to passengers planning to travel on key London Midland routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal that has been struck will also confirm the end date of the franchise as September 2015, ensuring that London Midland is given sufficient time to resolve these problems on a permanent basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London Midland will also spend millions of pounds improving the resilience of their trains and will invest at least £2.25 million on a range of measures to benefit passengers - primarily in the West Midlands, where the worst disruption was experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-for-editors"&gt;Notes for editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government is taking this action because London Midland were responsible for the cancellation of a high number of services, particularly at weekends and during the half-term period, due to a shortage of drivers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The free 5-day passes will enable annual and monthly season ticket holders to make additional journeys outside of their regular commute, or as an extension to existing season tickets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 500,000 additional cheaper advance tickets will be issued over and above those issued in the last year and will be for travel during 2013 and 2014. The tickets will be available on key routes including London-Birmingham, London-Crewe, London-Northampton and Birmingham-Liverpool.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Rail franchising</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Compensation package for passengers agreed with London Midland.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would today like to give an update on the situation in relation to franchised train operator London Midland (&lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passengers who use &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; trains may be aware that the operator has been experiencing difficulties recently, with a number of services being cancelled due to a shortage of driving staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation has caused inconvenience and disruption, particularly to passengers in the West Midlands, many of whom have expressed their dissatisfaction to me. I very much share their disappointment that they have not had the reliable service that they rightly expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, although the recent levels of performance have been extremely disappointing, I am pleased to say that the measures that &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; have put in place are beginning to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; has implemented increases to driver efficiency to enable drivers to operate an increased number of routes during existing shifts, improved driver training processes, provided additional incentives for drivers to work overtime and put in place new measures that allow for drivers to cover shifts on other parts of the network where there are shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in addition to the ongoing training programme that &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; is undertaking to ensure that new drivers enter productive service as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt;’s performance has been of such a level that they are now in breach of their contractual obligations. We have made London Midland aware that they must now take action to compensate passengers for the disruption caused. We have, therefore, agreed with &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; that they will provide a substantial package of passenger benefits by way of compensation for the inconvenience that has been caused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; has agreed to spend an additional £4 million over the remainder of the franchise to put in place measures to ensure that these problems do not happen again. In addition, the package of passenger benefits includes the issue of 5 free rail day passes to London Midland season ticket holders, with an expected value of up to £3.5 million. We have also agreed that London Midland will invest a further £2.25 million in infrastructure improvement projects. We have required London Midland to discuss with Centro, the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, how the majority of this money will be invested for the benefit of those passengers who have experienced the worst disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this consultation, &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; has agreed that most of this money should be directed towards measures such as improvements to safety and security at stations and improving the reliability and efficiency of &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we have also agreed with &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; that they must make available an additional 500,000 Advance tickets on key routes on the &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; network, giving a net benefit of around £1.9 million to passengers who will be able to take advantage of these cheaper fares over the next two years of the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; will be able to remain the operator of this franchise for the remainder of its contract - to September 2015. But London Midland will continue to work to challenging performance benchmarks for the remainder of the franchise, and we will take further action (including ending the franchise early and re-tendering it, if appropriate) in the event of any recurrence of performance problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the package of passenger benefits, we have agreed to revise the profile of performance benchmarks for the next year, to include additional measures that can penalise &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; financially in the event of further poor performance. We have also agreed financial measures to ensure that the reduction in revenue as a result of the free and discounted tickets is borne by &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt;, and not by the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am confident that this package, on balance, represents a good deal for passengers and taxpayers, and sends a message to the industry that this level of cancellations is unsatisfactory. I hope that &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; can now put this period behind it, and continue to operate a good service for its passengers for the remainder of its franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The Port of Dover</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Dover Port transfer scheme decision announced.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2010 Dover Harbour Board (DHB) submitted a voluntary transfer scheme in accordance with section 9 of the Ports Act 1991, which allows a relevant port authority to voluntarily submit a transfer scheme, which, if confirmed by the Secretary of State for Transport, would allow the port to be privatised.  This was followed by a statutory consultation period on Dover’s transfer scheme that ended on 25 March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 16 May 2011 the then Secretary of State for Transport, The &lt;abbr title="Right Honourable"&gt;Rt Hon&lt;/abbr&gt; Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Philip Hammond), launched a consultation on the criteria that the government considers relevant when considering the appropriateness of the sale of a major trust port. The revised criteria - Secretary of State for Transport’s guidance note concerning procedure for the sale of trust ports - was published on 3 August 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the revised criteria, DHB submitted more information in June 2012, and there was a further 6-week period for representations which ended on 27 July 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took over as decision minister from the &lt;abbr title="Right Honourable"&gt;Rt Hon&lt;/abbr&gt; Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers) in September 2012 and wish to announce the decision, on behalf of the Secretary of State, to the House today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decided not to confirm DHB’s transfer scheme. I reached my conclusion taking into account the published policy. I concluded that the transfer scheme proposed would not ensure a sufficient level of enduring community participation in the port. I also concluded that so far as the board made the application in order to be able to obtain the additional finance necessary to undertake the proposed redevelopment of the Western Docks, there were other options available to secure that redevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/government/publications/dover-transfer-scheme-decision-letter"&gt;full decision letter will be available on the department’s website&lt;/a&gt; shortly after this statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My honourable friend, the Parliamentary under Secretary of State, &lt;abbr title="Honourable"&gt;Hon&lt;/abbr&gt; Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond), as Minister for Maritime will now discuss with DHB, their plans for the future of the port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Passengers come first in new Civil Aviation Act </title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Civil Aviation Act has become law today and paves the way for airports to offer better facilities and information for passengers.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passengers have today been placed firmly at the heart of UK airport regulation as a new Civil Aviation Act becomes law. The Act paves the way for the Civil Aviation Authority (&lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;) to motivate airports to deliver better facilities, provide more information for passengers and give greater incentives for airports to prepare for disruptive events such as severe weather. The Act also makes provisions for future reforms to the Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing (&lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt;) scheme, which offers financial protection for holiday makers in the event of their tour operator going bust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Act sees a number of key changes to the powers and responsibilities of the aviation regulator, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;giving the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; a single overriding duty, for its airport economic functions, to further the interests of passengers and owners of cargo in the provision of airport operation services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creating a flexible licensing regime for regulated airports, enabling the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; to include licence conditions that require airports to respond more effectively when things go wrong (e.g. severe weather)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allowing the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;, where appropriate, to replace fixed price caps on airports with lighter touch forms of regulation and removing unnecessary central government involvement from airport regulation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; more effective enforcement powers, allowing it to impose sanctions of up to 10% of an airport operator’s annual turnover and daily amounts of 0.1% of turnover for breaching licence conditions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; with a new role in promoting better public information about airline and airport performance levels, enabling passengers to make informed decisions when making travel arrangements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; with a new role to promote better public information about the environmental effects of aviation and measures taken to mitigate adverse effects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conferring certain aviation security functions currently carried out by the Department for Transport, on to the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;. Responsibility for aviation security policy, and giving aviation security directions to industry, will remain with the Secretary of State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Act also enables Ministers to make future changes to the &lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt; holiday protection scheme, including the ability to bring holidays sold by airlines into the scope of the scheme. Earlier this year, the government introduced secondary legislation to update the &lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt; holiday protection scheme, making it more relevant to today’s market. The new powers in the Act will enable the protection available to consumers to be further strengthened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aviation Minister Simon Burns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is an important milestone in our drive to put the passenger experience unequivocally at the heart of how our airports are run.  Aviation is vital for providing the UK with the connections we need to do business, travel for leisure and visit our friends and families around the world.  I am grateful for the cross-party support this Act has received during its passage through Parliament – ensuring passengers and those sending cargo can enjoy the benefits of this new regime as swiftly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the Act has received Royal Assent, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; will work to bring the new airport economic regulatory framework fully into force in April 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Act introduces, and enables, reform in 4 main areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the framework for economic regulation of airports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the legislative framework of the Civil Aviation Authority&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing scheme (&lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conferring certain aviation security functions currently carried out by the Department for Transport, on to the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; - responsibility for aviation security policy remains with the Secretary of State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new regulatory regime for airports, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; is empowered to carry out a market power test, as set out in the Act, to determine whether an airport operator should or should not be subject to economic regulation. This replaces the designation of airports for price control regulation by the Secretary of State. Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports are currently designated and their current price controls, set under the Airports Act 1986, will continue to run until 31 March 2014. Over the next 18 months, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; will determine how to apply the new regime set out in the Act to the airports that are subject to economic regulation after this date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the existing regime, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; has 4 duties for the purposes of economic regulation, these are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to further the reasonable interests of users of airports within the UK. Users comprises airlines, passengers and other user of air transport services at the airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to promote the efficient, economic and profitable operation of such airports &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to encourage investment in new facilities at airports in time to satisfy anticipated demands by the users of such airports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to impose the minimum restrictions that are consistent with the performance by the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; of its functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; is also required to take account of international obligations notified to it by the Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures set out today will replace these with a single primary duty and a number of further duties to which the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; must have regard in carrying out the primary duty for the purposes of airport economic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="primary-duty"&gt;Primary duty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to further the interests of passengers and owners of cargo (both present and future), in the provision of airport operation services and to do so, wherever appropriate, by promoting competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="further-duties"&gt;Further duties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to ensure that licence holders are able to finance their provision of airport operation services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to secure that all reasonable demands for airport operation services are met&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to promote economy and efficiency on the part of licence holders in their provision of airport operation services at regulated airports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to secure that licence holders are able to take reasonable measures to reduce, control or mitigate adverse environmental effects of the airport to which the licence relates and aircraft using that airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to have regard to any international obligation of the UK notified to it by the Secretary of State&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to have regard to the principles of better regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; will have a duty not to impose or maintain unnecessary burdens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expanded regulation-making powers in the Act would allow more holidays to be included in the &lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt; scheme and would provide even greater clarity for consumers whilst ensuring a level regulatory playing field for businesses selling flight-inclusive holidays. The government’s intention is that such a step would only be taken following full consultation with stakeholders including an impact assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Operators urged to tackle crowding on busiest services</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Train operators are urged to tackle overcrowding on their services after a list reveals the top 10 most congested trains.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker has urged train operators to continue work to tackle congestion on their services following the publication today of the top 10 most crowded trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London is served by some of the busiest trains in the country according to the list of crowded trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Climbing on a crowded train where there is little space can often be an unpleasant experience and I sympathise with passengers who have to travel on these services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The operators on the list are aware of the crowding problems on these particular services. I will be monitoring these services closely, and others which have not made the top 10 list, and urging train companies to reduce crowding on the busiest services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rail has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years. That is why we are investing in more carriages, longer trains and better services and funding major projects like HS2, Crossrail and Thameslink, all of which will significantly boost capacity on our rail network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is an important tool to give increased transparency to passengers and help the industry act to improve journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list, compiled from data collected in Autumn 2011, shows that the following services were the busiest in England and Wales (in descending order): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:44am service from Henley on Thames to London Paddington – load factor 180%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7:32am service from Woking to London Waterloo – load factor 164%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6:13pm service from London Euston to Birmingham New Street – load factor 162%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4:48pm service from London Euston to Birmingham New Street – load factor 160%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6:30am service from Banbury to London Paddington – load factor 158%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7:55am service from Stourbridge Junction to Stratford-upon-Avon – load factor 157%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6:23am service from Manchester Airport to Middlesbrough – load factor 155%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6:17pm service from London Liverpool Street to Shenfield – load factor 154%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7:14am service from Alton to London Waterloo – load factor 152%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5:46pm service from London Euston to Birmingham New Street – load factor 152%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Department for Transport (DfT) collects rail passenger counts from train operating companies to monitor train crowding levels. All franchises let by DfT require the train operator to address crowding and to plan their timetables in such a way as to ensure, as far as possible, that crowding is not unduly concentrated on any particular route or individual service. The table included in this paper shows the 10 most overcrowded peak services in the autumn 2011 passenger counts data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ‘top 10’ list is determined based on ‘load factor’, which is the number of standard class passengers on a service expressed as a percentage of the standard class passenger capacity for that service. For example, a train which has the same passenger load as the passenger capacity would have a load factor of 100%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First Great Western has recently strengthened the 7:44am service from Henley on Thames to London Paddington by adding an additional carriage, so that the number of standard class seats has increased to 340.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From December 2012 London Midland is providing three Class 350/2 ‘high density’ units for the 6:13pm service from London to Birmingham New Street to maximise the number of seats. In the long term, London Midland has 10 new 4 car trains on order that will allow them to operate additional trains on this route from 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From September 2012, the 6:30am service from Banbury to London Paddington has started from Oxford not Banbury, leaving Oxford at 7:00am. It is now operated by a different type of rolling stock which provides a higher standard class seating capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More recent counts on the 7:55am service from Stourbridge Junction to Stratford-upon-Avon suggest much lower loadings on this service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the long term, from the May 2014 timetable period, it is planned to introduce a fifth train per hour between Manchester and Leeds which should relieve capacity on the 6:23am service from Manchester Airport to Middlesbrough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The top 10 list can be accessed on the &lt;a href="/government/publications/top-10-overcrowded-train-services-england-and-wales"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Cash boost for local roads</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Extra £215 million to local authorities for road maintenance.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Councils can plan how to spend their share of a £215 million fund for local road maintenance after funding allocations were published today by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £215 million is part of a £333 million fund announced in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement for essential maintenance to renew, repair and extend the life of roads in England.  This funding is in addition to the £3 billion the government is already providing for councils in England between 2011 and 2015 for highways maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This maintenance funding could be used for improvements such as road resurfacing, maintenance to bridges or repairing damage to highway infrastructure caused by severe weather events, such as the recent flooding.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick McLoughlin said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This extra money will support economic growth and development by helping local authorities to get the best out of their local road networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This funding can be spent on measures to bring smoother, safer and more reliable journeys to the travelling public whether they are commuting to work or taking the children to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help local residents see where this money has been spent it will be a condition of the funding that local authorities commit to publishing a short statement on their websites at the end of each financial year setting out what and where this additional funding has been spent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities are also encouraged to look at the information published by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/hmep"&gt;Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme&lt;/a&gt; which is leading the way by bringing together the public and private sectors to develop good practice and reduce costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced in the Autumn Statement on 5 December additional funding of £333 million for highways maintenance for both the motorway and trunk road and local road network. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£215 million additional capital funding will be provided to local highway authorities, including London, to help renew and repair the network in England. £140 million will come in 2013 to 2014, with the remaining £75 million following in 2014 to 2015. The funds will be distributed on the basis of the department’s existing highways maintenance capital funding formula. A &lt;a href="/government/publications/local-transport-capital-block-funding"&gt;full list of the allocations by region and local authority&lt;/a&gt; is available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To be eligible for this additional funding and to promote greater transparency and accountability, the department will require local highway authorities to publish a brief note on their website by the end of each financial year (end of April 2014 and end of April 2015) on where (in terms of location) and how this additional funding was spent on highways maintenance. This is so local communities are able to see how this extra funding has been spent. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme (HMEP) is a sector-led programme designed to maximise returns from highways investment and deliver efficient and effective services.  HMEP provides practical guidance on highway maintenance efficiencies for local authorities, supplier organisations and representative bodies in the form of toolkits, case studies and good practice.

    <title>New rights for maritime passengers</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A new EU regulation is set to give passengers travelling by water improved rights to assistance in cases of cancelled or delayed departures.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passengers travelling by water are set to enjoy improved rights to assistance in cases of cancelled or delayed departures as a new &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation on maritime passenger rights enters into force today. These passengers will now benefit from similar rights to those travelling by air and rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation, which will apply to most cruise and ferry services operating within the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;, also provides disabled persons or those with reduced mobility the same rights and accessibility assistance when travelling by water, as they have in other transport sectors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipping Minister, Stephen Hammond, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important that passengers receive protection across all modes of transport, enabling them to travel with increased peace of mind throughout the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;. While no one enjoys disruption to their travel plans, I am pleased that this new &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation will provide passengers with the right to assistance in cases of cancelled or delayed departures. I am also pleased that this new regulation provides disabled persons or those with reduced mobility the same rights and accessibility assistance when travelling by water, as they have in other transport sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most journeys run smoothly. On the rare occasions when things do go wrong, it is important that passenger complaints are taken seriously and dealt with effectively at the appropriate level. So in this respect, I am extremely grateful to all the bodies that have agreed to undertake voluntary complaint handling roles. This demonstrates collaborative working between government and industry at its best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of implementation, the Passenger Shipping Association has agreed to act as the voluntary complaint handling body for England and Wales, with London TravelWatch retaining responsibility for services operated and licensed by Transport for London. The Consumer Council for Northern Ireland and the Scottish Government have also agreed to take up similar roles in their respective areas.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Gibbons, Director of the Passenger Shipping Association, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are pleased that the Shipping Minister and the Department for Transport have selected us as the voluntary complaints handling body for Maritime Passenger Rights in England and Wales. Over the past 2 years we have worked very closely with DfT officials together with our member cruise and ferry companies to achieve a successful implementation. We are confident that the industry as a whole will continue to offer customers an excellent service and will deal effectively with any complaints that arise through this new regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to editors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government published its public consultation on UK’s implementation of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation on 5 October 2012. The 6 week consultation closed on 16 November 2012.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation applies in respect of passengers travelling:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on ferry services where the port of embarkation is situated in the territory of an &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member state  &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;on ferry services where the port of embarkation is situated outside the territory of an &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member state and the port of disembarkation is situated in the territory of an &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member state, provided that the service is operated by a union carrier. (‘union carrier’ means a carrier established within the territory of a member state or offering transport by a ferry service operated to or from the territory of a member state.)    &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;on a cruise where the port of embarkation is situated in the territory of an &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member state  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation includes a number of exemptions that are designed to exclude small boats and to protect small businesses. For example, it does not apply to ships certified to carry up to (and including) 12 passengers; on ships which have a crew responsible for the operation of the ship composed of not more than 3 persons; where the distance is less than 500 metres one way and on excursion and sightseeing tours other than cruises.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Under the new &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation, if an individual has a complaint, they should first raise it with the operator. If it cannot be resolved in this way, the complaint may then be referred to the appropriate complaint handling body. It is expected most complaints will be resolved at one of these 2 stages.  However if this is not possible, the complaint may then be investigated by the national enforcement body, who will consider whether there has been a breach of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; regulation. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) will operate as the national enforcement body for the whole of the UK.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Industry launches new rail technical strategy</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New techniques and technologies to improve the performance and cost-effectiveness of the railway.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail industry leaders have outlined a 30 year vision for the railway through a new edition of the ‘Rail technical strategy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Rail technical strategy’ describes how technology can help the railway increase capacity, improve reliability, cut carbon emissions and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy has been developed by the Technical Strategy Leadership Group – a cross-industry expert body with representatives from across the rail industry – and endorsed by the Rail Delivery Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.futurerailway.org"&gt;Read the Rail technical strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister of State for Transport  Simon Burns MP welcomed the strategy saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the industry picking up the baton to develop this Rail technical strategy. Technology has a vital role to play in improving the railway’s performance, cutting its costs along with carbon emissions and delivering a better travelling experience for passengers. By setting in place a 30 year vision, the railway is demonstrating that it has a bright and exciting future, and the potential to support our economy and society for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Revisions to the levels of funding required by goods and public service vehicle licence holders</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Revised figures announced for holders of goods and public service vehicle licences operating for hire or reward.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport has given notice of revisions to the levels of funding required by holders of goods and public service vehicle operators’ licences operating for hire or reward. This is a requirement of EU Regulation 1071/2009 which affects holders of standard national and standard international licences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Traffic Commissioners retain their discretion to set the financial standing levels for restricted licence holders (not covered by the regulation) and they propose to maintain the current rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised figures are set out below and are based on the euro exchange rate on the first working day in October 2012 – as prescribed by EU Regulation 1071/2009. The new rates will come into force on 1 January 2013 and will remain in place until the 31 December 2013 (previous rates are in brackets). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Minimum financial level requirement&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Standard national and standard international licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£7,200 (£7,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£4,000, ( £4,200)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Restricted licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£3,100 ( £3,100)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£1,700 ( £1,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial limits set by EU Regulation 1071/2009 are 9000 euros for the first vehicle and 5000 euros for each subsequent vehicle. For member states not participating in monetary union, the regulation requires the equivalent in their currencies to be revised every year, using the euro exchange rate published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the first working day of October in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Transport for everyone </title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Putting accessibility and equality front and centre when delivering services for the travelling public.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker is calling on operators and local authorities to work with government to put accessibility and equality front and centre when delivering services for the travelling public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help them to do this, the Department for Transport has published 2 action plans which set out priorities, as well as highlighting areas where action is in the pipeline or already underway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Transport for everyone’ outlines how operators, local councils and the Department can help to make it easier for people using public transport – particularly those with disabilities - to get to where they need to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This action plan builds on the success achieved in improving accessibility on public transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. At the heart of the plan is the importance of improving door-to-door journeys rather than addressing issues in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department’s equality action plan looks at how we can encourage a more inclusive transport network and underlines the importance of ensuring that policy makers at all levels are alive to the particular needs and concerns of different groups in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include affordability issues for young people and pensioners and the ability for all people to travel in safety and free from harassment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A good transport system allows people to access jobs, opportunities and vital services - it needs to work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recognise the concerns that specific groups of people have about public transport and so we have pulled together ideas from across the transport sector on how these concerns can be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The action plans will help policy makers, as well as transport operators, to tackle problems head on and - more importantly - to level the playing field for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liz Sayce OBE, Disability Rights UK Chief Executive, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An accessible transport infrastructure is essential for what Disability Rights UK wants to achieve – disabled people playing a full and equal part in society. Over the past 20 years we have come a long way as our practical guide ‘Doing transport differently’ shows but there are still too many attitudinal, communication and physical barriers facing disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Action plan’ is a step change towards making further progress. We welcome the commitment that the Department for Transport will continue to work in partnership with disabled people and our organisations to ensure the most effective steps are taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Accessibility action plan’ builds on the transport successes of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and aims to create a long lasting legacy of improved access and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Olympic and Paralympic Games, public transport operators carried thousands of spectators with disabilities and work was done to ensure that the travelling public had easy access to information. One of the aims of the ‘Accessibility action plan’ will be to build on the Games Spectator Journey Planner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new planner would cover a wider geographical area and more types of transport as well as being made accessible to people with visual impairments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other measures outlined in the plan include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;considering where £100 million of extra funding might be best spent in the long term to improve accessibility of railway stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;possible further amendments to the Blue Badge scheme to tackle abuse and fraud in this area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building on guidance for mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs to encourage training for those using this equipment &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Equality action plan’ sets out in one place what the department is doing to ensure people from all parts of society have the option to use public transport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points addressed in the plan include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessibility to public transport for young people, older people and those living in rural areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;safety and personal security for women travellers, particularly at night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tackling hate crime and bullying on buses and other public transport &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promoting employment of under-represented groups within the transport industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both documents include lists of issues and the actions that have been, or will be, taken to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accessibility-action-plan"&gt;‘Accessibility action plan’&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/equality-action-plan"&gt;‘Equality action plan’&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the interests of transparency and to enable as many people as possible to have their say, the ‘Equality action plan’ will be open for comment until 15 February. These will feed in to a final version of the document which will be published in due course.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The action plans will help policy makers, as well as transport operators, to tackle problems head on and - more importantly - to level the playing field for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liz Sayce OBE, Disability Rights UK Chief Executive, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An accessible transport infrastructure is essential for what Disability Rights UK wants to achieve – disabled people playing a full and equal part in society. Over the past 20 years we have come a long way as our practical guide ‘Doing transport differently’ shows but there are still too many attitudinal, communication and physical barriers facing disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Action plan’ is a step change towards making further progress. We welcome the commitment that the Department for Transport will continue to work in partnership with disabled people and our organisations to ensure the most effective steps are taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Accessibility action plan’ builds on the transport successes of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and aims to create a long lasting legacy of improved access and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Olympic and Paralympic Games, public transport operators carried thousands of spectators with disabilities and work was done to ensure that the travelling public had easy access to information. One of the aims of the ‘Accessibility action plan’ will be to build on the Games Spectator Journey Planner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new planner would cover a wider geographical area and more types of transport as well as being made accessible to people with visual impairments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other measures outlined in the plan include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;considering where £100 million of extra funding might be best spent in the long term to improve accessibility of railway stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;possible further amendments to the Blue Badge scheme to tackle abuse and fraud in this area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building on guidance for mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs to encourage training for those using this equipment &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Equality action plan’ sets out in one place what the department is doing to ensure people from all parts of society have the option to use public transport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points addressed in the plan include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessibility to public transport for young people, older people and those living in rural areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;safety and personal security for women travellers, particularly at night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tackling hate crime and bullying on buses and other public transport &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promoting employment of under-represented groups within the transport industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both documents include lists of issues and the actions that have been, or will be, taken to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government accepts proposals to improve garage standards</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Motorists encouraged to check their garage is industry-standard approved.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorists are being encouraged to find out if their garage is approved by a set of industry-standard codes to make sure they are getting value for money.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call comes after the government accepted a number of proposals made by industry experts to help drive up standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Motorists’ Forum has set out a raft of recommendations aimed at making sure motorists have the best possible consumer experience when having their vehicles serviced or repaired in a report released today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will promote the wider adoption of self-regulation (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;-&lt;abbr title="Trading Standards Institute"&gt;TSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) codes of practice by garages and encourage greater publication of information regarding services they offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an AA survey*, 78% of people always use the same garage meaning that only a minority of motorists shop around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the work carried out by the Motorists’ Forum and believe the recommendations will help build on existing best practice in the industry without the burden of extra legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important that consumers feel confident in the quality and the value for money of the services they are receiving from garages. The Forum’s report has offered some useful proposals for how this can be achieved more consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would urge motorists to find out if their local garage has been approved by the codes to ensure they are getting a fair service and value for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will now use their strong relationships with the industry and stakeholders to promote the adopted recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK car service and repair sector is worth around £6.9 billion per year to the GB economy with 150,000 MOT tests taking place every working day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Motorists’ Forum report on garage customer experience can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-report-of-the-motorists-forum-sub-group-on-improving-customer-service-experience-at-garages"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s response can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-motorists-forum-report-on-garage-customer-experience"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Motorists’ Forum is made up of a group of experts convened by the DfT. Organisations include the AA, RAC, &lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, Centre for Automotive Management, &lt;abbr title="compulsory basic training"&gt;CBT&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Transport for London"&gt;TfL&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Association Of British Insurers"&gt;ABI&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Freight Transport Association"&gt;FTA&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association"&gt;BVRLA&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety"&gt;PACTS&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders"&gt;SMMT&lt;/abbr&gt; as well as representatives from the DfT and Highways Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Trading Standards Institute (&lt;abbr title="Trading Standards Institute"&gt;TSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) will be taking over responsibility for the consumer codes approval scheme from the Office of Fair Trading (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;). The new scheme will maintain the rigour of the current scheme, but will streamline the approval process and make it self-funding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responsibility for vehicle roadworthiness and testing lies with DfT and &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; administers the MOT scheme. Responsibility for consumer protection legislation lies with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is already considerable consumer protection legislation in place to cover the practices of garages which choose to trade unfairly or who are not competent to trade; both from the perspective of individual consumer rights through sale of goods and services legislation, and through the application of criminal sanctions, principally via the Consumer Protection from unfair trading regulations&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Improving motoring services</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Consultation to suggest improvements about how motoring services are delivered.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Road users, businesses and other stakeholders were today invited to suggest improvements to the way motoring services such as driving tests and vehicle licensing are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is putting customers firmly at the heart of the way motoring services are delivered so that they best serve the consumer while getting the best possible deal for the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the Department for Transport is outlining broad reform proposals for the 4 motoring services agencies: Driving Standards Agency (DSA); Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA); Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) and the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roads Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you drive, run a business or pay taxes you will be a customer of ours and I hope you will have your say about how we can improve the services we offer you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much progress has already been achieved and it is now much easier to use digital services to get driving licences, and sort out vehicle tax. We have also already announced that we are bringing the driving test closer to customers by exploring a range of different locations, such as colleges and retail premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But there is more that can be done and this consultation is about the government listening to its customers before agreeing the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department’s 4 agencies are already engaged in programmes of reform to deliver long term financial stability and efficiency, and better services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation sets out a longer term view of the future of these reforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Position the agencies at the forefront of digital services, ensuring that those who find access to digital services difficult are supported to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support economic growth and vehicle manufacturing by reforming the Vehicle Certification Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring the driving test closer to the customer by exploring opportunities to improve convenience to customers. This includes assessing options for the delivery of the practical test. We are keen to explore all options that maintain the integrity of the test and high quality standards whoever is the provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transform &lt;abbr title="heaviy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt;, bus and coach testing by expanding joint ventures and collaboration with private sector providers, and reducing the number of government owned test stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliver better customer services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider rationalising the number of bodies and agencies involved in delivering services - delivering services as simply as possible, increasing flexibility and innovation, improving efficiency and reducing costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 7 March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation is the department’s response to the government’s broader vision for public services as set out in the civil service reform plan, the Open Public Services white paper and the government digital strategy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The consultation document can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/motoring-services-strategy"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
