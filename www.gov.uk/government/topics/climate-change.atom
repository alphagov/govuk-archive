    <title>Low carbon bus calculator</title>
    <summary>This toolkit can be used to calculate the likely benefits on investing in a low carbon emission bus (LCEB).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the benefits of purchasing a low carbon bus will be different for each operator and will depend on the way in which the bus in service is used. So, Department for Transport economists have produced a transparent, user-friendly toolkit to be used by bus operators and local authorities to calculate the likely benefits on investing in a low carbon emission bus (&lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;). Your assessment should always compare the &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; to an equivalent diesel bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit allows you flexibility in changing the input assumptions to those most relevant to you. You will be able to assess the financial implications of purchasing a &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;, based on the fuel savings on offer (as advised by &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; manufacturers or experienced in trials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spreadsheet tool is intended to provide indicative estimates only and &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; does not vouch for the accuracy of such estimates. Please note that the Department for Transport does not accept any liability for any decisions that may be taken on the basis of such estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit will be routinely updated and refined. Details of any updates or changes that are made will be outlined in the ‘Intro’ worksheet of the toolkit. We therefore encourage you to visit this website regularly and download the toolkit to ensure you are using the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Biofuels: the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, progress on adoption and the next generation </title>
    <summary>Speech by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the Westminster Energy, Environment and Transport forum for inviting me to speak at your event this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to have the chance to talk to you about the possible next steps on biofuels policy. First though, I want to talk a bit about how we got to where we are today, and in particular about developments over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition government has stuck by its commitment to cut the carbon footprint of road transport by implementing measures which promote the use of renewable energy, including of course biofuels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concerted effort has not only contributed towards the European Renewable Energy Directive and Fuel Quality Directive targets, but also, in the case of sustainable biofuels, to our international obligations on climate change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took an important step towards the goal of truly sustainable biofuels when we implemented the transport elements of the Renewable Energy Directive last December. The introduction of mandatory sustainability criteria means that to benefit from incentives under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (&lt;abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation"&gt;RTFO&lt;/abbr&gt;) biofuels must now, with some exceptions, deliver greenhouse gas savings of at least 35% compared to fossil fuels. They also cannot be sourced from areas of high biodiversity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes we made to the &lt;abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation"&gt;RTFO&lt;/abbr&gt; last year also introduced double counting. This provides a further incentive for biofuels made from wastes and residues, in recognition that these feedstocks are unlikely to compete with food production or contribute to indirect land use change. In the first 4 years of the &lt;abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation"&gt;RTFO&lt;/abbr&gt;, the proportion of biofuels produced from wastes, rather than crops, increased from 12% to 49%.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am confident that we have already made significant progress towards ensuring that biofuels used in the UK are sustainable. Indeed, in my view it is imperative that the UK biofuel industry continues to invest and grow.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to be able to open the Agri Energy biodiesel plant in Bootle in Liverpool this year….a large new investment that will see the collection of wastes turned into biodiesel.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it is vital that we keep seeing profitable investments like this which produce low carbon energy, provide jobs and help us to meet our ambitious carbon reduction targets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while biofuels should be a key means of achieving carbon reduction targets, we also know that some biofuels still carry sustainability risks. We remain very concerned that studies have demonstrated that some biofuels can even produce greater carbon emissions than fossil fuels, particularly when indirect land use change (or &lt;abbr title="indirect land use change"&gt;ILUC&lt;/abbr&gt;) is factored in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have consistently made clear at European level that &lt;abbr title="indirect land use change"&gt;ILUC&lt;/abbr&gt; needs to be addressed urgently to ensure that people can be confident that available biofuels mean genuine &lt;abbr title="greenhouse gas"&gt;GHG&lt;/abbr&gt; savings.  It is very much in the interests of the biofuel industry itself that we reach this point, and do so as soon as we can.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is helpful that the long awaited &lt;abbr title="indirect land use change"&gt;ILUC&lt;/abbr&gt; proposal was adopted and published by the European Commission last month. My officials and I are currently analysing the proposal and its implications.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission’s proposal sets a 5% cap on the level of contribution food-crop-based feedstocks can make to our 10% &lt;abbr title="Renewable Energy Directive"&gt;RED&lt;/abbr&gt; transport target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal also includes additional support for advanced biofuels, seeking to encourage further development in feedstocks which do not compete for food, feed or land.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to ensure that we have a settled policy framework based on good scientific evidence, and I hope that these European developments can move towards this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime though, I genuinely do not believe that setting further short term interim targets can provide the clarity industry continues to demand.  It might give the veneer of certainty over a body of doubt.  Although I fully appreciate that industry needs clarity on future policy to plan investment, it is equally crucial that government’s policy achieves what it is meant to deliver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I have adopted a cautious approach in setting future biofuel targets within the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation.  Better in my view to go slower in a direction that is certain rather than to go fast and have to change direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been too many examples of government moving too quickly forward on a policy which they have later had to pull back on.  Furthermore, industry tells me that it is certainty they want, not an impression of certainty which turns out to be vacuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I can assure you that we will continue to investigate potentially helpful options, such as the advanced biofuels, which I believe offer a real opportunity for investment and growth for the whole economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer term the advancement of the biofuels industry will surely rely on the development and commercialisation of many of these new technologies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also interested in the potential to use biofuels in sectors where, at present, there are limited options to decarbonise…. such as in aviation and &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, I recognise the importance of biomethane made from waste as a sustainable renewable transport fuel, particularly in the heavy goods vehicle sector where there are real market barriers to uptake of low emission technologies such as hybrid, electric and gas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support the use of lower emission &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; technologies, the Department for Transport has made available over £11 million capital funding to trial low carbon lorries and their supporting infrastructure.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13 projects, trialling over 300 vehicles between them, will receive funding towards the cost of low emission &lt;abbr title="heavy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; technologies.  The funding is also being used to help establish gas refuelling infrastructure.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initiative will increase the number of low carbon lorries on the road but it will also provide vital information on the performance of these vehicles in the real world….something that will help encourage wider uptake of lower carbon lorries and promote the use of biomethane as a sustainable fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also keen to develop this technology for buses, and am doing so through the Green Bus Fund.
Biofuels are of course just 1 part of a wider strategy to encourage growth and cut carbon.  For example, we are also committed to supporting the uptake of ultra low carbon vehicles in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spending Review announced provision of over £400 million to support the development of the ultra low emission vehicle market work to 2015.  This support package includes funding;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for recharging infrastructure  schemes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to promote the uptake of ultra-low emission cars through the Plug-In Car and Van Grants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;of £82 million to support for research and development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition UKH2Mobility was launched last January. This joint undertaking with key industry stakeholders will evaluate the potential for hydrogen as a fuel for ultra low carbon vehicles in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biofuels have become an important part of the UK economy, of our national infrastructure and of efforts to meet our international emission and energy targets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we are focused on ensuring that this national resource is used appropriately and that the full consequences of growing biofuels are considered and assessed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coalition government believes that it is possible both to safeguard the environment and support the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that these goals are not incompatible. Quite the reverse. They are in fact 2 sides of the same coin. You can cut carbon and boost growth and our work with biofuels is proof of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK biofuels industry continues to lead the world in sustainable and renewable fuels and I am proud of the efforts and achievements the industry has made so far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain our lead in this industry and to address barriers to supply, we need to continue to work closely with suppliers and to listen to concerns raised about the social and environmental sustainability of biofuels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way not only will we get the best deal for the industry, the taxpayer and the consumer… we will get the right policies for our the transport sector, the economy and the environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Improving the energy efficiency of buildings and using planning to protect the environment</title>
    <summary>We need to reduce carbon emissions from buildings and make sure that planning policies help to protect and improve the environment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009 buildings accounted for about 43% of all the UK’s carbon emissions. Buildings and other developments can also damage the environment, through poor waste management or inefficient use of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to reduce carbon emissions from buildings and make sure that planning policies help to protect and improve the natural and built environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have included policies in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2" title="National Planning Policy Framework"&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/a&gt; to explain how developments should be planned to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce carbon emissions from buildings, we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are requiring local planning authorities to make sure that new developments are energy efficient &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;will require all new homes to be zero carbon from 2016 and are considering extending this to include all other buildings from 2019&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have introduced the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/tackling/green_deal/green_deal.aspx" title="Green deal"&gt;green deal&lt;/a&gt; to enable people to pay for home improvements over time using savings on their regular energy bills &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have improved &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment/supporting-pages/energy-performance-of-buildings" title="Energy Performance Certificates"&gt;Energy Performance Certificates&lt;/a&gt; to make them more informative and user-friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment/supporting-pages/code-for-sustainable-homes" title="Code for sustainable homes"&gt;Code for Sustainable Homes&lt;/a&gt; which provides a single national standard for the design and construction of sustainable new homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help protect trees we have simplified the system for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment/supporting-pages/tree-preservation-orders" title="Tree preservation certificates"&gt;tree preservation orders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also work with the 9 &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment/supporting-pages/aggregate-working-parties" title="Aggregate working parties"&gt;aggregate working parties&lt;/a&gt; who provide technical advice about the supply and demand for aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government is responsible for developing town and country planning policy and rules that affect the environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our policies on planning and the environment are set out in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment/supporting-pages/national-planning-policy-framework-and-the-environment" title="National Planning Policy Framework"&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/a&gt;, published in March 2012 following extensive public consultation. The framework is an important part of the government’s reforms to make the planning system less complex and more easy to understand, and to promote sustainable growth. It replaced and simplified a series of earlier planning policy statements and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="impact"&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the government’s policy to revoke existing regional strategies outside London. However, any final decision on this must take account of assessments of, and consultation on, the possible environmental effects. We are updating the earlier environmental reports and undertaking further consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A written ministerial statement made by Baroness Hanham on 25 July 2012 sets out the background and explains why the reports are being updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bills-and-legislation"&gt;Bills and legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All EU member states must follow the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. This requires that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all properties (homes, commercial and public buildings) must have an Energy Performance Certificate when sold, built or rented&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;larger public buildings must display a Display Energy Certificate &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all air-conditioning systems over 12kW must be regularly inspected by an Energy Assessor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Strategic environmental assessment about revoking the North East regional strategy: environmental report</title>
    <summary>Consultation document on the likely environmental effects of revoking the North East of England Plan and the regional economic strategy. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environmental report is a consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revocation of the North East of England Plan and the regional economic strategy (which together form the regional strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report succeeds the previous environmental report on the revocation of the North East of England regional strategy which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012. It is a stand alone document the intention of which is to provide the reader with an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of the revocation of the North East of England Plan and the regional economic strategy without the need to refer back to the previous environmental report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report proposes to retain the saved structure plan policy S5 from the Northumberland County and National Park Joint Structure Plan First Alteration relating to the green belt at Morpeth. Removing this policy before the council has adopted a local plan which defines green belt boundaries could put green belt land at risk from unwanted development. This is in line with the Coalition Agreement to safeguard green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Double boost for carbon cutting buses</title>
    <summary>An extra £20 million is being made available for the government’s Green Bus Fund.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extra £20 million is being made available for the government’s Green Bus Fund Transport Minister Norman Baker has announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in a second boost for low carbon buses Mr Baker has today launched an easy-to-use toolkit to allow local authorities and bus operators to make informed decisions on investing in carbon cutting buses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £20 million funding will be the fourth round of the Green Bus Fund, bringing the total support for this initiative to £95 million since its launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The additional funding has been found from an underspend in the Department for Transport’s budget and those wishing to buy green buses will be able to apply for the round four support this financial year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cutting carbon emissions from transport is not a choice, it is a necessity and that is why I am prioritising green buses and giving operators and local authorities an extra £20 million to deliver on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our new toolkit will be indispensible in allowing those considering investment in low carbon buses to see the advantages for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The new online low carbon bus calculator will make it easier to quickly work out the savings that can be made over time through cheaper running costs and fuel efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details on the bidding process and eligibility will be published soon on the department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new low carbon bus toolkit will help operators and local authorities work out how the finances might stack up, with or without support from the Green Bus Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those wanting to work out how long it will take for a low carbon bus to pay for itself can now go online and use the new calculator which will allow them to quickly work this out using assumptions around capital costs and fuel efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While buses using low carbon technologies tend to be more expensive than conventional buses many are eligible for government support and running costs are usually lower so that, over time, they are actually the more economical choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toolkit launched today will allow councils and operators to see at a glance how quickly they can expect a return on investment in low carbon buses using a variety of carbon saving technologies such as hybrid or electric buses. It also shows operators and local authorities the savings on offer through reduced running costs from low carbon buses compared with running a bus using conventional fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toolkit also allows the user to tailor the calculation of costs to their specific circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/low-carbon-bus-calculator"&gt;toolkit is available&lt;/a&gt; on the department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Round 4 of the Green Bus Fund was launched on the 6 November 2012. Bidding and eligibility guidance for the 4th round will be issued shortly on the Department for Transport website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scotland is holding a separate £3 million competition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The budget for round 4 of the Fund is £20 million with the funding coming from an underspend in the department’s budget.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is the fourth round of the government’s grant. Round one was launched in 2009 and paid up to 100 per cent of the difference, with round two paying up to 90 per cent and round three up to 80 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Further details on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/background-to-the-green-bus-fund"&gt;fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buses funded through the Green Bus Fund are eligible for the Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) Low Carbon Bus incentive of 6p for every kilometre operated in service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Previous rounds of the Green Bus Fund have part funded diesel hybrid buses, which run on a combination of diesel and a battery, fully electric buses and biomethane-fuelled gas buses. Eligibility for the 4th round will be published shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each year, every low carbon bus in London saves around 26 tonnes of CO2 compared with its diesel equivalent, with buses outside London estimated to save around 22 tonnes.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Investment in green buses</title>
    <summary>Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce today that the department is making a further £20 million available to help bus operators and local authorities in England buy low carbon emission buses through a fourth round of the Green Bus Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operators and authorities will be able to bid for a share of this funding to meet the additional up-front cost of purchasing these buses, and we calculate that this will allow for around 300 new low carbon buses to be bought. This investment will aid the department’s overarching objectives of helping to create growth and cut carbon, as well as help to support UK manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guidance document will be published later this month giving more details of how bus operators and local authorities can bid for a share of this fund. Copies of this will be placed at the same time in the libraries of the House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/low-carbon-bus-calculator"&gt;toolkit has also been published today&lt;/a&gt; advising bus operators and local authorities on how quickly they can expect a return from investing in low carbon emission buses.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biofuel statistics: Year 4 (2011/12), report 5</title>
    <summary>This publication presents statistics on the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for the obligation year 15 April 2011 to 14 April 2012 (Year 4).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents statistics on the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for the obligation year 15 April 2011 to 14 April 2012 (Year 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes information on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of UK road transport fuel from renewable and fossil fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) which have been issued to sustainable renewable fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the balance of RTFCs by obligation period;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trades of RTFCs between suppliers and/or traders; and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carbon and sustainability (C&amp;amp;S) characteristics of the renewable fuel supplied ¹.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-headline-figures-are"&gt;The headline figures are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six billion litres of renewable transport fuel have been supplied in the 48 months since the RTFO began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="in-year-4-14-april-2011-to-15-april-2012-of-the-rtfo"&gt;In Year 4 (14 April 2011 to 15 April 2012) of the RTFO:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.6 billion litres of renewable fuel have been supplied, which is 3.6% of total road transport fuel reported to the RTFO Administrator against an annual obligation of 4.0%. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More biodiesel (57%) has been supplied than bioethanol (43%). There were also small volumes of biogas, biomethanol and pure vegetable oil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1.7 billion RTFCs have been issued of which 464 million were for double counting feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="from-15-dec-2011-to-14-apr-2012"&gt;From 15 Dec 2011 to 14 Apr 2012:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;43% of the Year 4 RTFCs were issued to biofuel supplied in this period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The largest proportion of renewable fuel was derived from used cooking oil (229 million litres, 45% of total biofuel supplied). The most widely reported source (by feedstock and country of origin) for biodiesel was used cooking oil from the Netherlands (48 million litres, 18% of biodiesel supplied). The most widely sourced bioethanol was corn from the United States of America (163 million litres, 69% of bioethanol supplied).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;12% of renewable fuel was sourced from UK feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An aggregate greenhouse gas saving of 63% compared to fossil fuels was achieved. This figure excludes emissions from indirect land-use change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;¹ This report contains fuel volume and RTFC data for the whole obligation period, and verified C&amp;amp;S data on renewable fuels supplied for the period after implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive (15 December 2011 to 14 April 2012). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unverified C&amp;amp;S data for renewable fuels supplied for the period 15 April to 14 December 2011 can be found in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/biofuels-statistics"&gt;Biofuels series&lt;/a&gt;. We expect to publish verified data for this period in February 2013&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents statistics on the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for the obligation year 15 April 2012 to 14 July 2012 (Year 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes information on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of UK road transport fuel from renewable and fossil fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) which have been issued to sustainable renewable fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the balance of RTFCs by obligation period;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trades of RTFCs between suppliers and/or traders; and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carbon and sustainability (C&amp;amp;S) characteristics of the renewable fuel supplied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-headline-figures-are"&gt;The headline figures are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6.3 billion litres of renewable transport fuel have been supplied in the 51 months since the RTFO began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="in-the-first-quarter-of-year-5-of-the-rtfo-14-april-2012-to-15-july-2012"&gt;In the first quarter of Year 5 of the RTFO (14 April 2012 to 15 July 2012):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;321 million litres of renewable fuel have been supplied, which is 2.9% of total road transport fuel reported to the RTFO Administrator against an annual obligation of 4.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More bioethanol (60%) has been supplied than biodiesel (36%). There were also small volumes of biogas, biomethanol, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and pure vegetable oil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;154 million RTFCs have been issued of which 69 million were for double counting feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="cs-characteristics-of-the-biofuels-to-which-rtfcs-have-been-issued-37-of-the-total-biofuel185"&gt;C&amp;amp;S characteristics of the biofuels to which RTFCs have been issued (37% of the total biofuel)¹:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The largest proportion of renewable fuel was derived from non-European Community corn (66 million litres, 55% of total biofuel to which RTFCs have been issued). The most widely reported source (by feedstock and country of origin) for biodiesel was used cooking oil from the USA (8 million litres, 31% of biodiesel to which RTFCs have been issued). The most widely sourced bioethanol was corn from the United States of America (65 million litres, 76% of bioethanol to which RTFCs have been issued).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11% of renewable fuel was sourced from UK feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An aggregate greenhouse gas saving of 59% compared to fossil fuels was achieved. This figure excludes emissions from indirect land-use change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;¹ The final deadline for applying for RTFCs is 12 August following the obligation period.&lt;/p&gt;
