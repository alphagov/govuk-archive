    <title>UK National Strategy on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict</title>
    <summary>This 2012 Annual report summarises the UK's work on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2010 the United Kingdom launched a national strategy on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict (PoC). The strategy, a collaboration between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence, sets out what the Government is doing to keep the Protection of Civilians at the forefront of our work on political, security and humanitarian fronts. The strategy covers the period 2010-2013, and provides for annual progress reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 2012 report summarises the UK’s work in four policy areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Political engagement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protection by peace support operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Humanitarian action&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;State capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The Foreign Office's Human Rights work in 2011</title>
    <summary>The Foreign Office response to the Foreign Affairs Committee's recommendations regarding the Foreign Office's Human Rights work.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government welcomes the attentive scrutiny of its human rights work during 2011 carried out by the Foreign Affairs Committee. The Government agrees with the FAC’s assessment that the UK has a strong record in upholding human rights across the world. We welcome the FAC’s comment that our Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy for 2011 provides ample evidence of our work in promoting higher standards of human rights abroad, sometimes in difficult circumstances. We were pleased that the FAC recognise the considerable effort that went into the production of the FCO’s Annual Human Rights Report for 2011. We have taken steps to strengthen our human rights reporting over the last two years in response to direction from Ministers and feedback from the FAC and others. We will continue to ensure that our reporting is targeted to meet the needs of Parliament and our national and international readership.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Command Paper sets out the Government’s response to the Foreign Affairs Committee’s report of 17 October 2012 into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s Human Rights Work in 2011. The Committee’s recommendations are set out in bold. Unless otherwise indicated, references are to paragraphs in the Foreign Affairs Committee Report (HC116).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary marks anniversary of UN declaration on Holocaust </title>
    <summary>Foreign Secretary William Hague marks the 70th anniversary of the UN declaration denouncing the treatment of Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary William Hague said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Seventy years ago the British Government, shocked by mounting evidence from Poland of Nazi extermination of the Jews, joined eleven other war-time allies in a sharp united condemnation of what was happening on the continent of Europe. Sir Anthony Eden’s Statement to Parliament on 17 December 1942 was followed by much public and Parliamentary discussion in the UK and among the United Nations about what could be done to stop the genocide and had a strong impact on subsequent allied planning for the post-war trials of Nazi leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The disastrous events of the Holocaust continue to reverberate through Western society, as the Stockholm Declaration in 2000 so eloquently reaffirmed. The British Government supports the work of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research (&lt;abbr title="Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research"&gt;ITF&lt;/abbr&gt;) and looks forward to assuming the chairmanship of the &lt;abbr title="Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research"&gt;ITF&lt;/abbr&gt; in 2014/15.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK has serious concerns about human rights in Tibet</title>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire has said that the UK has serious concerns about the self-immolations in Tibetan regions.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a European Union statement on self-immolations in Tibet, Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We strongly support the recent statement from Baroness Ashton about the situation in Tibet. We continue to have serious concerns about the human rights situation there, including the self-immolations in Tibetan regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We urge the Chinese authorities to exercise restraint. At the same time, I join Baroness Ashton in calling on Tibetans not to resort to extreme forms of protest such as self-immolation, and urge their community and religious leaders to use their influence to stop this tragic loss of life. We strongly support the resumption of meaningful dialogue to resolve the underlying grievances of Tibetan communities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I also urge the Chinese government to ensure unrestricted access to the Tibetan Autonomous Region and other Tibetan areas of China for diplomats, international media and other concerned parties. We believe a long term solution is best achieved through respect for universal principles of human rights and genuine autonomy for Tibet within the framework of the Chinese constitution.”   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK condemns Palestinian refugee camp bombing in Damascus</title>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt has condemned the attack by the Syrian regime which killed at least 20 people yesterday.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on reports of Syrian government air strikes on the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, Foreign Office Minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I condemn the Syrian regime’s aerial bombardment of the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus, which killed at least 20 people yesterday. They are among four hundred Syrians killed across the country this weekend in yet another tragic reminder that the Assad regime continues to attack its own people with brutality and without remorse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Syrian government actions have already driven hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians from their homes into neighboring countries. The senseless targeting of Palestinian refugees, who had hitherto looked to Syria for shelter and protection, will only exacerbate the risk of contagion across the region. Our objective remains an end to the violence and a transition to a more democratic and stable Syria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

He said “Syria needs a political transition leading to an inclusive new government, with full executive authority. This is the course most likely to achieve stability in the country.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="international-human-rights-day"&gt;International Human Rights Day&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On International Human Rights Day Baroness Warsi launched the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-minister-baroness-warsi-marks-human-rights-day" title="Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi marks Human Rights Day"&gt;UK’s campaign for election to the Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt;. She said: “We believe in a Human Rights Council that can make its voice heard, even when the issues are unpopular or difficult to hear.” The Foreign Office marked &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/" title="16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence"&gt;16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence&lt;/a&gt; ending on Monday with a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/post/37632415718/helen-pankhurst" title="guest post"&gt;guest post from Dr. Helen Pankhurst&lt;/a&gt; from CARE international. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said that the Iranian investigation into the death of the blogger Sattar Beheshti whilst in custody had &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/iranian-investigation-into-detained-blogger-is-missed-opportunity-for-justice" title="Iranian investigation is missed opportunity for justice"&gt;failed to deliver justice&lt;/a&gt;. The Minister said: “The bruises on his body – which the authorities have abjectly failed to explain – are almost certainly a result of mistreatment and brutality that he – like so many others – suffered in detention.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="also-this-week"&gt;Also this week&lt;/h4&gt;

    <title>Foreign Office Minister Rt Hon Hugo Swire MP: "Britain believes in Burma and the Burmese people".</title>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Rt Hon Hugo Swire MP led a trade mission to Burma earlier this week.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all I would like to thank the people of this beautiful country for the very warm welcome I have received here. I have been touched by their remarkable kindness and courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few days I have met leading ministers, civil society and business leaders who have been eager to share with me their aspirations for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Government I discussed a full range of issues. I welcomed their efforts on ethnic reconciliation, but registered my serious concerns about the ongoing situation in Kachin urging the government to take all necessary measures to stabilise conditions there and insure the safety of civilians. We continue to urge both sides to bring an end to the conflict.
I raised my serious concerns about the situation in Rakhine State, which I visited this morning, and where thousands of people have displaced by violent unrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this afternoon I had the great honour to meet Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and spoke to her about the many challenges facing Burma, not least the ongoing conflict in Rakhine State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share Daw Suu’s concern about the situation having witnessed for myself the seriousness of the humanitarian situation. Conditions remain extremely worrying. I have visited the IDP camps and seen the thousands of people, crowded into tents, with little food or sanitation, and reliant on aid. It left me in no doubt that without urgent action this tragedy will continue to deepen for all concerned. We spoke about the work of her Parliamentary committee and its recent urging for greater security, humanitarian aid, accountability and respect for human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can deliver one message on behalf of the people I met at these camps it is that we need to see determination on all sides to bring an end to this conflict and reach a meaningful political solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Government is already playing its part including working with trusted NGOs to deliver emergency water, sanitation and healthcare to over 58,000 people from both communities. While we are presently the single largest aid provider, much more needs to be done and we are working to rally international action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of this country’s broader progress, what everyone wants to see here is rapid development and consolidation of democracy. What does that mean? It means that the country operates under the rule of law with strengthened democratic institutions and with respect for human rights; it means greater trade and prosperity so that people are employed; and it means utilities and services from roads to railways, from accessible credit to clean water, and reliable electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end I led a trade mission here focusing on the power sector with the aim of helping this country meet its ambition of a tenfold increase in its energy generation over the next decade. This is the sort of responsible investment we need to see here. Modern energy infrastructure, developed we hope with British expertise, will mean that everyone will have access to electricity in their homes and that manufacturers will be able to invest with confidence and produce things people want to buy. I welcomed the government’s commitment to responsible investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to finish on a positive note. This is a beautiful country with lofty ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain believes in Burma and the Burmese people. The best way we can help is not by ignoring its problems but by working together to tackle them. If we can do that then everyone will be able to enjoy the benefits of a free, developed, and prosperous nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Iranian investigation into death of detained blogger is missed opportunity for justice</title>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt has said that the Iranian investigation into the death of the blogger has failed to deliver justice.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marking the 40th day anniversary of the death of Sattar Beheshti, Foreign Officer Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is now forty days since the blogger Sattar Beheshti died in custody in Iran. I would like to use this occasion to extend my condolences to his family. That the Iranian authorities instigated an investigation into Sattar’s tragic death should have been a positive step. However, once again the authorities have failed to deliver justice. Neither Sattar’s family who have reportedly faced harassment and threats from the security services, nor Sattar’s countrymen and women have been given credible answers about the events that led to his death. Instead, the state-controlled media and the parliament have dismissed his death as a heart attack brought on by a fear of arrest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sattar was right to be afraid of the security forces and what could happen to him in jail. The bruises on his body – which the authorities have abjectly failed to explain – are almost certainly a result of mistreatment and brutality that he – like so many others – suffered in detention. We are deeply disappointed that having taken the initiative to investigate,  Iran has been unwilling to hold those responsible to account. The sacking of the head of Cyber Police will not stop the security and detention forces from operating with impunity. Systemic change is needed to bring about a more transparent and accountable system.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK to contribute funds to Courts in Sierra Leone and Cambodia</title>
    <summary>The Foreign Secretary William Hague has announced UK funding for Courts in Sierra Leone and Cambodia to strengthen international justice.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary William Hague has updated parliament on UK contributions to the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia and the Special Court for Sierra Leone in a written ministerial statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can announce that in order to strengthen international justice and help secure accountability for some of the most horrific crimes against humanity in the last 50 years, the UK will make a voluntary contribution of £1,000,000 to the Special Court for Sierra Leone and a voluntary contribution of £600,000 to the international component of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s contribution will help ensure the Special Court for Sierra Leone is able to complete its work, and leave a lasting legacy for the people of Sierra Leone. On 30 May, the Court sentenced Charles Taylor, a former President of Liberia, to 50 years in jail for aiding and abetting war crimes. Taylor is the first former Head of State to be convicted by an international tribunal and the Court is currently hearing his appeal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia is delivering long awaited justice for millions of Cambodians through the trials of the most senior and responsible surviving members of the Pol Pot regime. The scale of the crimes committed and the number of victims makes it one of the most significant tribunals of its kind since Nuremberg. The Government’s contribution will help to prevent the collapse of the Court which has faced a significant shortfall in funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International justice is central to foreign policy. It is essential for securing the rights of individuals and states, and for securing peace and reconciliation. Through the International Criminal Court, and the separate international tribunals, we are working to make clear that those responsible for the worst crimes will be held to account and that political leaders will not enjoy impunity. Our support to these institutions is an important element in our strategy to reduce conflict, promote stability and strengthen the rules based international system. In order to give Parliament a full accounting of this work we will, from this point forward, also provide an annual statement at the start of the financial year detailing our progress on this important issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Promoting human rights internationally</title>
    <summary>Promoting human rights, and political and economic freedom around the world.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people around the world are denied their human rights every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government supports human rights, democracy and good governance around the world to increase Britain’s security, to protect British citizens overseas, and to secure political freedom globally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/promoting-human-rights-internationally/supporting-pages/human-rights-and-democracy-programme-2012-13"&gt;Human Rights and Democracy Programme 2012 to 2013&lt;/a&gt; has allocated £6.5 million to support various projects, including those aimed at: preventing torture, abolishing the death penalty, increasing people’s freedom of expression, giving people freedom of religious belief, achieving gender equality and enabling them to take part in free elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual &lt;a rel="external" href="http://fcohrdreport.readandcomment.com/"&gt;Human Rights 2011 &lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; Report&lt;/a&gt; explains the Government’s work to create democratic societies and promote human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="democracy-and-the-rule-of-law"&gt;Democracy and the rule of law&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government supports &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/promoting-human-rights-internationally/supporting-pages/equality"&gt;democracy and the rule of law&lt;/a&gt; in a range of different ways. These include funding non-governmental organisations (&lt;abbr title="non-governmental organisations"&gt;NGOs&lt;/abbr&gt;) to increase citizen participation in political debate, reforming the European Court of Human Rights and working with regional and inter-governmental organisations and through the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.wfd.org/"&gt;Westminster Foundation for Democracy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="supporting-peoples-freedom-of-expression"&gt;Supporting people’s freedom of expression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government supports freedom of expression, including on the Internet, and will continue to press countries that restrict access to online media to uphold their &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/promoting-human-rights-internationally/supporting-pages/equality"&gt;international human rights commitments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that the right to freedom of expression applies, in principle, with equal force in cyberspace as elsewhere. We work with other countries to build a wider consensus about freedom of expression on the internet and to guard against the growing trend of political repression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK joined the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.minbuza.nl/en/appendices/the-ministry/final-declaration-coalition-freedom-online.html"&gt;Freedom Online Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, a coalition of like-minded states that shares information on violations of freedom of expression and other human rights online, and cooperates in supporting and protecting human rights online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="equality-and-non-discrimination"&gt;Equality and non-discrimination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK works to support &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/promoting-human-rights-internationally/supporting-pages/equality-and-non-discrimination"&gt;equality and non-discrimination&lt;/a&gt; for all people, including gender equality; upholding the rights of minority groups and lesbian, gay and transgender people; supporting the freedom of religion and belief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="preventing-torture"&gt;Preventing torture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is working with other countries and organisations to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/promoting-human-rights-internationally/supporting-pages/preventing-torture"&gt;prevent torture&lt;/a&gt; by funding projects to make criminal justice systems fairer and developing national organisations that can effectively monitor places of detention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="abolishing-the-death-penalty"&gt;Abolishing the death penalty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is working with the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; to persuade other countries to abolish the death penalty. Our &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/global-issues/human-rights/death-penalty-strategy-oct-11-15"&gt;Strategy for Abolition of the Death Penalty 2010-2015&lt;/a&gt; explains how the government persuades other governments to abolish the death penalty, funds projects to restrict the use of the death penalty and raises individual cases of British nationals sentenced to death overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Group of Human Rights, which consists of non-governmental experts, was created in 2010 by the &lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; to give the Foreign Secretary the best possible information about human rights challenges; and for the Foreign Office to benefit from outside advice on the conduct of its policy. The group  discusses a wide range of human rights issues including those relating to conflict, security and counter-terrorism, the events of the Arab Spring, freedom of religion or belief, and business and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-were-working-with"&gt;Who we’re working with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt;’s primary body for discussion and action on human rights issues.  The UK was an active member from its inception in 2006 until June 2011.  We will bid for re-election in 2013 and in the meantime will remain an active supporter of the Council. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also seek complementary action on human rights in other parts of the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt;, including through the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.un.org/ga/third/index.shtml"&gt;Third Committee of the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, where all &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; members can vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based in The Hague, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home"&gt;International Criminal Court (ICC)&lt;/a&gt; is the first ever permanent court with the jurisdiction to prosecute individuals accused of the most serious crimes of international concern: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The Court was established by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html"&gt;Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt;. The ICC is an independent international organisation, and is not part of the United Nations system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
