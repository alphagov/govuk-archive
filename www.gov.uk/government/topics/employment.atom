    <title>Employee Ownership and Share Buy Backs - Consultation on implementation of Nuttall Review recommendations</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The Nuttall Review on Employee Ownership recommended (Recommendation V) that the Government should review and consult on changes to deregulate the conditions under which companies can: authorise share buy backs; finance share buy backs; and hold shares ‘in treasury’.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on deregulatory changes to the conditions under which companies can authorise and finance the repurchase of its own shares, and hold these shares once repurchased. The regulation of share buy backs is governed by the Companies Act 2006. Changes to these regulations, such as those proposed in this consultation would require changes via secondary legislation. The draft regulations attached below indicate how the government would implement these changes. Through this consultation we would also like to understand the implications for companies, employees, and other shareholders. In particular we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to collective redundancies rules to help employees and businesses were announced by Employment Relations Minister, Jo Swinson, today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government announced it plans to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce the current 90 day minimum period, before very large scale redundancies can take place, to 45 days&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;legislate to make clear that fixed term contracts which have reached the end of their natural life are excluded from obligations for collective redundancies consultation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introduce new non-statutory Acas guidance to address a number of key issues affecting collective redundancies consultation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employment Relations Minister, Jo Swinson said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK has a labour market that is flexible, efficient and fair but some of our laws need reform to respond to an ever changing employment landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We want to improve the quality of consultations by making sure that there are tools available to help employers manage this process fairly and successfully to deliver the best possible outcomes for all parties.  Acas will be working with stakeholders to produce non-statutory guidance that will be designed to help improve the quality of consultations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have listened to stakeholders and there is a strong argument for shortening the minimum period which is backed up by hard evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The process is usually completed well within the existing 90-day minimum period, which can cause unnecessary delays for restructuring, and make it difficult for those affected to get new jobs quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our reforms will strike an appropriate balance between making sure employees are engaged in decisions about their future and allowing employers greater certainty and flexibility to take necessary steps to restructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement responds to a consultation launched in June and to calls for improvements to the way collective redundancies rules operate and for the processes involved to be made easier to understand. It also forms part of the Government’s commitment to review employment law to support business and concentrate on growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replacement of the current 90 day period to 45 days will still allow full employee engagement and offer employee representatives a statutory right to contribute to the process. The new 45 day period will be a minimum period, and businesses may consult for longer where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes will be made through secondary legislation. Draft regulations will be laid in the New Year and the changes are expected to be made by 6 April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Coalition government started a systematic review of employment law in 2010. This Employment Law Review (ELR) is now half way through its work and aims to provide clarity, certainty and give businesses the confidence to manage their workforce effectively. The Review sits alongside the Employment Law-related Red Tape Challenge to reduce regulatory burdens on business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A copy of the government’s response to Collective
Redundancies can be found at
&lt;a href="/government/consultations/collective-redundancies-consultation-on-changes-to-the-rules"&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/collective-redundancies-consultation-on-changes-to-the-rules
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Growth and Infrastructure Bill sets out a comprehensive series of reforms aimed at supporting businesses, developers, and first time buyers by slashing red tape that delays or discourages business investment, development or job creation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe
Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    <summary>How the government is changing employment laws to encourage companies to hire staff while protecting employee rights. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses say current employment laws are difficult to cope with and put them off taking on staff. This slows the growth of businesses and the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simpler, more flexible employment laws will make it easier for companies to hire and manage staff, while protecting basic workers’ rights. This should encourage employers to create new jobs, supporting enterprise and growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the labour market more flexible, efficient and fair the government is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agreed to review employment law in May 2010 as part of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition-agreement-may-2010_0.pdf" title="Coalition Agreement"&gt;Coalition Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extended the time you need to be employed to be able to claim for unfair dismissal from 1 to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enterprise-and-regulatory-reform-bill-policy-paper" title="Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill"&gt;Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill&lt;/a&gt; which will make changes to the employment tribunal system, including ensuring all employment tribunal claims go to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1461" title="Acas"&gt;Acas&lt;/a&gt; and introducing a simpler process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;removed the compulsory retirement age, making it easier for older people to carry on working&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launched a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Regional-Mediation-Pilot-Schemes-up-and-running-67b90.aspx"&gt;pilot scheme&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the use of mediation to resolve disputes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reviewed how employment rights are enforced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-we-are-consulting"&gt;Who we are consulting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve carried out consultations on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    <title>Reform of flexible parental leave</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Parents will be able to share parental leave and revolutionise their lives at work and home.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has announced reforms that will allow parents to share up to a year’s leave after the birth of a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government plans to legislate on this next year, and will introduce the changes to flexible working in 2014 and to flexible parental leave in 2015. Under the new system, parents will be able to choose how they share the care of their child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employed mothers will still be entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave. However, working parents will have much greater flexibility about how they ‘mix and match’ their leave. They may take it in turns or take it together, providing it is not more than 52 weeks in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="greater-choice"&gt;Greater choice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mothers will have to take at least the initial two weeks of leave after birth as a recovery period, but can then choose to end the maternity leave and the parents can opt to share the remaining leave. It will be up to both parents to decide how they share the remaining weeks. Nick Clegg welcomed the announcement, saying;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Reform is long overdue and the changes we are making will shatter the perception that women have to be the primary care-givers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the future, both mothers and fathers will be able to take control of how they balance those precious first months with their child and their careers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is good news not only for parents and parents-to-be, but employers too who will benefit from a much more flexible and motivated workforce.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="engaged-employees"&gt;Engaged employees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers will benefit from being able to make the most of the entire talent pool that the increased flexibility allows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Employment Relations, Jo Swinson, said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If we are to deliver sustainable, strong growth we need to get the best out of both men and women in the workforce.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Current arrangements are old-fashioned, inflexible and gender-biased. People should have the right to choose how they balance their work and family commitments.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These proposals bring good news for business - not least a more motivated and productive workforce. Employers will be able to recruit and retain staff from a wider pool of talent in turn helping to diversify our economy and drive growth.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Extending the right to request flexible working will enable all employees to discuss flexible working with their employer, and move the discussion away from why the employee needs to work flexibly, and onto how flexible working will work for the business.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assesses the impact of proposals on extending flexible parental leave in the closed consultation on modern workplaces (URN 11/699). The new system of flexible parental leave aims to give parents more choice and flexibility in how they care for their child in the first year, encourage more fathers to play a greater caring role, and increase flexibility for employers and employees to reach agreement. See also 12/1267 for the government response and 12/1271 for the equality impact assessment. Underlying data for this publication is available in a machine processable format on the Transparency/Report Data webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
