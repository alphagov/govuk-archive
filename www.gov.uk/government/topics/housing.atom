    <title>Ebbsfleet</title>
    <summary>Over the next 20 years, more than 20,000 new homes will be built at Ebbsfleet, Kent, with builders on site as early as summer 2013.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 29 August, the Department for Communities and Local Government announced a support package to unlock 22,600 new homes at Ebbsfleet, Kent over the next 20 years. Developers, Land Securities, have invested over £100 million in developing the site. However, plans have been delayed amid concerns over the cost and the need for further investment in transport improvements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kent County Council and Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils worked closely with the department, and with Department for Transport and the Highways Agency to reduce costs of the transport programme and to agree how funding could be unlocked.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, builders could be on site as early as summer 2013 with the first homes set to be completed by December 2013. The first phase of 1,500 homes at Eastern Quarry is expected to be completed by 2020, with a further 3,000 homes ready by 2030 to 2031. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastern Quarry forms part of longer term plans which are expected to unlock the development of 22,600 homes and around 1 million metres squared of commercial development across the Kent Thameside region over the next 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Cranbrook</title>
    <summary>The new Cranbrook community in East Devon, has the capacity to deliver 6,000 new homes between 2012 to 2026.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Cranbrook community in East Devon, has the capacity to deliver some 6,000 new homes over the period 2012 to 2026. Almost a third of all housing required in the wider Exeter area is directly dependent on the successful delivery of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1 of the development is already underway, funded by a £12 million repayable grant from a revolving infrastructure fund (RIF) managed by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) and being repaid on a roof tax basis. Using this funding the developer (the Cranbrook New Community Consortium) can build 1,120 homes by 2015, along with building the main access route into Cranbrook, the Clyst Honiton Bypass and a primary school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="investment"&gt;Investment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government investment of £20 million will provide: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£10 million for a new secondary school&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£4 million for a second primary school&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£6 million for infrastructure and services to create a new high street for the town centre and commercial areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This investment will ensure continuity of the scheme, securing the delivery of phase 2, while putting in place the capacity for up to 6,000 homes on this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="impact"&gt;Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government’s investment, subject to due diligence, will directly unlock phase 2 and provide the infrastructure and school facilities that will give local partners the confidence to build an additional 2,380 homes by 2019.  It will also enable the developer to put in place enough infrastructure to support 6,000 homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the housing, government investment will help create the confidence to bring forward the new town centre and support the realisation of the full ambition for the scheme. It will also provide employment (1,500 jobs) and retail space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Get Britain Building: Bath Riverside</title>
    <summary>On the banks of the River Avon, the regeneration of Bath Riverside will transform Bath's western river front into a residential quarter.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set on the banks of the River Avon, the regeneration of this site has started to transform Bath’s western river front into a modern residential quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crest Nicholson is creating a vibrant new community of more than 2,000 homes, with some available for private sale, through the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/affordable-home-ownership-schemes/first-buy-equity-loans"&gt;FirstBuy&lt;/a&gt; equity loan scheme, and for rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="getting-on-the-ladder"&gt;Getting on the ladder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FirstBuy initiative helps first time buyers get a foot on the property ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FirstBuy is jointly funded by developers and the government, and works by enabling buyers to own their own home by only paying 80% of the purchase price. At Bath Riverside a 20% top up loan is offered by Crest Nicholson and the government, and buyers need a deposit of just 5% of the purchase price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Cocks, 25, had nearly given up hope of buying his own home until he became aware of FirstBuy on the properties already completed at Crest Nicholson’s Bath Riverside development. He has now moved in to his 1-bedroom apartment at the scheme and is relishing his new-found independence and the security of home ownership in Bath’s newest community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was living with my parents in Bradford-on-Avon but I have a 4 year old son who stays with me every other weekend, so that wasn’t an ideal situation”, explains Ben, who works in higher education. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I had been renting previously, but it was impossible to save for a deposit while paying rent. I heard about the FirstBuy scheme after reading about it in the local press late last year, and noticed that it was available at Bath Riverside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without the FirstBuy scheme I would have found it pretty much impossible to get on the housing ladder,” said Ben. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="unlocking-development"&gt;Unlocking development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is also supporting developers with access to much needed finance through the Get Britain Building programme. Up to 16,000 homes on stalled sites across England will be built by March 2015 thanks to this programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second construction phase of 240 homes is currently underway, which has been supported by £2.8 million of investment from the Get Britain Building programme. A recoverable investment, the programme helps developers access finance, and to help bring forward marginal sites by sharing risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme is run by the Homes and Communities Agency (&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt;). Executive director Colin Molton said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bath Riverside is one of the most important developments in the South West, and I am pleased that we’ve been able to help keep Bath building and create quality new homes and safeguard jobs in the area.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A biomass central energy system, 2 new public parks, bike storage and easy access to the city centre along the towpaths, and brown and green roofs demonstrate the developer’s commitment to sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the support provided through Get Britain Building, the &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; also invested around £2 million in vital infrastructure work which unlocked the first phase of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Get Britain Building: Carlisle Park</title>
    <summary>Nearly 400 homes are set to be built on the site of a former tar distillery thanks to Gleeson Homes and HCA investment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new community of nearly 400 homes is set to be built on the site of a former tar distillery thanks to Gleeson Homes and investment from the Homes and Communities Agency (&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Croda Tar Distillery, on the border between Kilnhurst and Swinton, closed in the early 1990s. Over the past 2 decades the 31 acre site has lain derelict with the heavily contaminated site proving a challenge for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in 2010 Gleeson identified the site, which is adjacent to the Sheffield &amp;amp; South Yorkshire Navigation Canal, as having great potential for new low cost homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with Rotherham Borough Council and remediation specialists, work is now underway to clean up the site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the clean-up has been completed Gleeson Homes will begin to transform the area into 381 new 2, 3 and 4 bedroom homes.  The developer will be making use of £2.2 million of investment from the Homes and Communities Agency’s (&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt;) Get Britain Building programme to start the first phase of 125 homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craig Johns, Area Manager at the &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The development at Carlisle Park offers a real choice of quality homes to local residents where they want to live at a price they can afford. Our investment will ensure that a local firm will provide these homes which will help safeguard jobs in South Yorkshire.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development will feature a mix of first time buyer and family homes, set among public open space and children’s play areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Gamble, Gleeson Homes Group Land Director said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are delighted that Carlisle Park is part of the Get Britain Building programme. The programme will help us to deliver the first tranche of 125 new homes which are built and priced to suit local people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The project will also have a positive effect of the wider community with the creation of new jobs, apprenticeship opportunities for local young people and investment back into the local area.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recoverable investment, the Get Britain Building programme helps developers access finance, and to help bring forward marginal sites by sharing risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to 16,000 homes on stalled sites across England will be built by March 2015 thanks to this programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Get Britain Building: Heron's Reach</title>
    <summary>The Get Britain Building programme is delivering new homes, safeguarding jobs and contributing to economic growth in Heron's Reach.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficult conditions in the local housing market caused building work at Heron’s Reach, a former mill near Saddleworth Oldham, to stall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help get work back on site, family-owned developer Wiggett Homes successfully applied for £1.5 million of development finance from the Get Britain Building programme. Work on the 41 homes began in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sites with just 15 homes could apply for the recoverable investment to restart their mothballed sites, and the programme was designed particularly to help small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) get the necessary finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme is being managed by the Homes and Communities Agency (&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt;) on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government. The programme is expecting to provide between 12,000 and 16,000 homes by March 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wiggett Homes was the first &lt;abbr title="small and medium-sized business"&gt;SME&lt;/abbr&gt; in England to exchange contracts and restart work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phil Wiggett, a chartered surveyor by profession who set up Wiggett Construction in 1979, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Heron’s Reach development stalled some time ago so we’re pleased that the &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; is supporting us to deliver these 41 new homes. Work is underway on the next phase of construction which is a major boost to the economic regeneration of the area and will create new jobs and apprenticeships for local people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trading has been difficult in these recessionary times and private housing for sale is still slow, but there is the odd green shoot and footfall is improving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Almost at the peak of the boom the company acquired a site at Knoll Mill, Greenfield, Saddleworth, near Oldham. With the land bought at the height of the market, the slow sales and falling house prices meant building work at the site stalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now that we have sold the first phase of 16 new homes, and having been successful with Get Britain Building funding, workers are back on site and these new homes will be ready by the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wiggetts has been impressed with how the &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; dealt with the Get Britain Building funding. The people we dealt with had an in-depth knowledge of the industry, were very professional and dealt with our application quickly with the result that we are now back on site.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; Executive Director for the North West, Deborah McLaughlin added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is great news that work is continuing at this vitally important project, which is delivering much needed high quality new homes and jobs for Oldham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to see that the Get Britain Building programme is delivering new homes, safeguarding jobs in our area and contributing to economic growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Government funding to unlock delivery of 12,000 new homes</title>
    <summary>New government support for large housing sites will unlock the delivery of new homes and create thousands of jobs.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intervention will accelerate building on 2 large sites in East Devon and near Milton Keynes; unlocking development and bringing forward construction to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A £20 million injection of funding for the new town of &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/cranbrook"&gt;Cranbrook&lt;/a&gt;, near Exeter, will enable local partners to bring forward the delivery of new homes included in the local plan, and create 1,500 jobs in the town that will include 6,300 homes and a new rail station with links to London and Exeter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money will also unlock construction of a new high street and transport infrastructure needed to develop the town centre, as well as 2 new schools in the next phase of development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a visit to Cranbrook, the minister met local construction apprentices who would work on the scheme. He said the government’s investment would create jobs for young people and bring a powerful economic boost to the area, while giving the consortium behind the new town the confidence and resources to drive forward its completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark Prisk with construction apprentices" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5640/Mark-Prisk-meets-apprentice.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mark Prisk meets apprentices who will work on the new town at Cranbrook&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk also revealed that the construction of 6,000 new homes on the Fairfield development in Milton Keynes will also be brought forward without the need for direct funding, following discussions with the developer behind the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intervention builds on the deal made earlier this year for the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/ebbsfleet"&gt;Eastern Quarry&lt;/a&gt; development near Ebbsfleet in Kent, a site for over 22,000 homes, bringing total number of potential homes unlocked through these schemes to over 34,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the minister also pledged support for housing programmes near Wokingham, where £2.5 million will enable local partners to solve key transport issues in the town in order to unlock the potential for over 10,000 new homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said the government is making strong progress to boost house building despite the difficult economic circumstances, and he was in discussions with other schemes across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This government is serious about building more homes. That’s why we have been looking carefully at how we can accelerate large, planned housing schemes that already have the support of local people, but need help to move forward in the current economic climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So I’m delighted that today I can announce our intervention will unlock the delivery of 12,000 new homes, and create thousands of jobs for local people. In the months ahead I will be announcing support for similar schemes. That means more investment, more jobs for our young people and more affordable homes for families across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have set aside considerable funding to assist large housing programmes like Cranbrook, and I would urge anyone with similar proposals to come forward and contact my department.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;East Devon District Council Leader Councillor Paul Diviani said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a unique opportunity here to create Cranbrook’s town centre as a shining exemplar of how all town centres can function!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Currently the town centre is a blank canvas; we are not restricted by existing buildings or street formations. With support from central government our vision of a town centre that is vibrant, attractive, welcoming, the beating heart of the new community, can become a reality much sooner than previously expected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement is the first allocation of £225 million, earmarked by the Chancellor in last week’s Autumn Statement, for the delivery of 50,000 new homes in large, locally-supported housing programmes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding programme for planned, large-scale sites, administered by the Homes and Communities Agency, will be targeted at schemes that could deliver real benefits to their communities, but are struggling to move forward because the current economic climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside funding to unlock new construction, the schemes will receive a package of support, including help to facilitate close co-operation with the local council and community during planning and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="progress-on-public-land"&gt;Progress on public land&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said an expert review published today also demonstrates the government is taking the right steps to quickly release its previously-used, surplus land for building new homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the recommendations in the report, led by the chairman of Berkley Group, Tony Pidgley, are already shaping measures being taken forward by the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date enough land has been sold to build up to 33,000 new homes, and last week’s Autumn Statement included a £290 million fund for the Home and Communities Agency to introduce measures that will quickly bring forward new sites for development, such as installing the right infrastructure so the land can be used for building new homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony Pidgley, chair of the Expert Advisory Panel said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a golden opportunity to deliver growth and great places. It’s surplus public land. It doesn’t need new legislation. All that’s required is a simple system to dispose of the land, alongside investment in infrastructure, and then the private sector can get on with building these much needed homes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further reaction to the funding support for Cranbrook: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the consortium partners - Hallam Land, Persimmon Homes and Taylor Wimpey - Mike Owen, project manager for Cranbrook, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were privileged to give Mark Prisk a tour of the development which gave him an insight into the brand new community being created. From the very start the development of Cranbrook has been about partnership and this announcement of funding support for phase 2 continues that process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without this phase 2 Cranbrook would have been delayed at the end of phase 1. Instead, we have certainty in the delivery of phase 2, we can move ahead now and commit with confidence to the next key stages of the project and delivering further community infrastructure and bringing forward much needed private and affordable homes. The success of Cranbrook to-date has been underwritten by the amenities and infrastructure that we have been able to provide. In turn this has enabled the creation a real community from day one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councillor Will Mumford, Chair of Exeter and Heart of Devon Growth Board and cabinet member for Economy, Enterprise and Employment, Devon Council said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that Cranbrook has been recognised for its successful delivery and for the additional funding to enable us to bring phase 2 forward. This keeps the project momentum going, will secure additional jobs and investment and is a resounding vote of confidence in the partnership approach.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin Molton, Homes and Communities Agency Executive Director for the South and South West, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The government has shown its commitment to housing and development as a major route to driving economic growth and we welcome the confidence ministers have shown in our ability to deliver its key initiatives, supported by new investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s welcome news also that Cranbrook is rightly identified as a vanguard project which will help drive economic growth in the south west, by providing the essential investment needed to deliver the second phase of the project. This is a huge opportunity, and I know that our partners will grasp it to maximise delivery of new homes and growth in Exeter and East Devon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Prisk backs new rough sleeping helpline</title>
    <summary>A new national hotline and website will connect rough sleepers with local help.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone looking to help rough sleepers this winter should contact a new service to get them long-term support, Housing Minister Mark Prisk said today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister spoke at the launch of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.streetlink.org.uk"&gt;StreetLink&lt;/a&gt;, a new national hotline and website service that connects rough sleepers with the local help and advice they need to get off the streets and get their lives back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="StreetLink poster" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/2025/streetlink_poster.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that while many want to help the people they see sleeping rough, they don’t know what to do. So the government has supported homelessness charities Homeless Link and Broadway to develop this new service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said that StreetLink offers concerned members of the public a better option than handing out money or food, by directing rough sleepers to the help they need, and providing them with a “hand up, not a hand out”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this service, the public can now turn their concern into practical action and take a direct step to help rough sleepers change their lives for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister urged people across the country to get behind StreetLink and call if they see someone in need this Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With the nights getting colder, many people will be wondering how they can help when they see someone facing a night on the streets. StreetLink will give them the chance to make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This new service will help rough sleepers across the country to connect with their local services, offering the help and advice they need to get back on track. So save the StreetLink number, 0300 500 0914, onto your phone, download the app or bookmark the webpage today. Your action could help a rough sleeper get out of the cold and into long-term support.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>National summit to end rough sleeping</title>
    <summary>Speech by Housing Minister Mark Prisk on the launch of StreetLink and successful local steps to end rough sleeping.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time of year, when the cold weather bites, it’s natural that people are concerned when they see people sleeping on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as you know better than most, this is not just an issue at Christmas; it’s a year-round problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is not enough to offer a helping hand just during the season of good will. To really make a difference, we need to tackle the causes of rough sleeping, all the year round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="government-action"&gt;Government action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the problems we face today, is a lack of affordable homes in the housing market. A market in which, for 15, maybe 20 years, we have seen just half the homes we actually need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, when this government came to power, we committed to building more homes, and more affordable homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means unlocking substantial investment of £19.5 billion so we’re able to deliver 170,000 new affordable homes over this Parliament. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means a significant expansion of the private rented sector, to give tenants much greater choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it’s a sector that has often been overlooked, which is why we asked Sir Adrian Montague to carry out an independent review of the sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve now adopted his excellent report with a clear commitment, to provide a £10 billion debt guarantee and a £200 million equity finance fund, so that we can deliver more new homes for rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s often a debate about whether to focus on owner occupied homes, or the private rented sector, or affordable housing. But we need to deliver in all 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, we want there to be a bigger, better housing market, capable of providing people with more quality and more choice at affordable prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we are building more homes, but we’re also determined to address all the issues that drive people towards homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we protected £400 million of funding, for tackling and preventing homelessness, over 4 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because homelessness is caused by the convergence of different problems, my predecessor Grant Shapps established the Ministerial Working Group that, for the first time, regularly brings ministers together from across Whitehall - from Health and Welfare, to Justice and even Defence - because we need to look at all the links between homelessness and for example, mental health, as well as some of the unique challenges which people face if veterans or former prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="homelessness-prevention"&gt;Homelessness prevention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we’ve put the right building blocks in place, and today I want to discuss how else we’re moving forward, not least by focussing on prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular the new approach, through StreetLink to stop people slipping through the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means tackling the underlying problems. And, (if people do turn to sleeping rough), early intervention to ensure they are swiftly helped off the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why, (on top of the £400 million funding for tackling homelessness), we announced an additional £70 million last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extra cash is ensuring vulnerable single people, (a high risk group), get early access to good housing advice, to prevent them becoming homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="no-second-night-out"&gt;No Second Night Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also looking to boost hostel provision, and supporting the national roll out of ‘&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nosecondnightout.org.uk/"&gt;No Second Night Out&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now after a really encouraging pilot in London (which we were able to support), this initiative is proving essential in ensuring people do not become caught up in a pattern of sleeping rough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s proved effective at providing a rapid response to new rough sleepers, by ensuring that no one has to sleep out for a second night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, tackling problems early is fundamental to the scheme’s success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m pleased that the momentum for ‘No Second Night Out’ is growing, with several more authorities adopting the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merseyside was quick off the mark, being the first area outside London to introduce their own initiative last February. 6 local authorities are now working in partnership, to really put an end to persistent rough sleeping they’ve had to endure right across the Liverpool city region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a commendable achievement and an example to other authorities - and you will hear more about how they delivered this when Councillor Anne O’Byrne speaks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="streetlink"&gt;StreetLink&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are many people beyond government (and the professionals) who also want to help. Often they see people sleeping rough, but they are not quite sure what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re concerned that giving money isn’t the best solution, but don’t know where else to turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, as a government, we decided to support your sector to develop a new approach, with the launch of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.streetlink.org.uk/"&gt;StreetLink&lt;/a&gt; today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how will it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, for the general public StreetLink provides a central point of contact, that people who want to help rough sleepers can call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minute anyone sees someone on their local street or town centre sleeping rough in their neighbourhood, they will be able to contact StreetLink and provide details on a confidential and secure basis, so vulnerable people can be found and connected to local services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of the new approach is that it’s easy to use. StreetLink will be contactable by phone on 0300 500 0914, by using the website, the mobile website accessible by smartphone, or by using the StreetLink ‘app’, available for iphones and android devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You maybe concerned that it’s difficult to do, but if I can get it on my mobile (and my wife will confirm), anyone can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it won’t just be about reporting problems: members of the public will also be able to see what action has been taken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ll be able to ask for email feedback from local services about the outcome of the information they’ve provided, and see the outcomes of their referrals on the StreetLink website, on a Google map that they can search by location. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for the first time, the public will be able to judge for themselves whether rough sleeping is being taken seriously and tackled effectively in their locality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean for service providers - local authorities and your sector? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By involving the public, it will mean your outreach teams can help more people, because you will have better intelligence about what’s happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeless Link tell me that every local authority has agreed to accept referrals, with some already receiving and acting on the details provided by the public through the website, which has been live for over two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also supports your approach to helping rough sleepers. You, more than anyone, know that they need a hand-up, not just a handout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the public will now be able to turn their concern into practical, effective action, and take a direct step to help vulnerable adults change their lives for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally - it will help link up the different services helping rough sleepers. Callers in an area with a ‘No Second Night Out’ initiative or other rough sleeping helpline will be transferred directly to that scheme. In other areas StreetLink will refer the details to the local authority or local outreach team for action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a smart, joined-up way of tackling the problem, and will have truly national coverage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’d like to pay tribute to Homeless Link and Broadway for its development, using the support from government. It’s real partnership in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, most of us will struggle to understand what it is like to sleep on the streets. That’s why, when people see rough sleepers, they want to reach out and help them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a government, we are determined to engage with this issue, and ensure the right intervention is made, as early as possible. We need to break the habit to help people to turn their lives around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this must be a collaborative effort - including local authorities and the voluntary and charity sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me say a big thank you to all of you for the vital work you do. It’s tempting for the media to think it’s just a Christmas issue, but it’s 365 days a year. You are part of the reason we have one of the best safety nets in the world, to prevent and tackle homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m particularly delighted that, from today, StreetLink will strengthen this safety net. Everyone will now have an easy and effective way of helping change the lives of those who have been on the fringe, for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s much more to do, but I’m confident that, together, we can make a real difference to thousands of people, who are real in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Appointments to the Homes and Communities Agency Regulation Committee</title>
    <summary>The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has appointed two non-executive members following open competition.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two non-executive members are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Adlington&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ingeborg Kettner-Wood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the appointment, Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am pleased to announce the decision to appoint Jonathan Adlington and Ingeborg Kettner-Wood as members of the Homes and Communities Agency (&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt;) Regulation Committee. Their legal and financial expertise will strengthen the Committee’s capacity to deliver effective regulation in the social housing sector, with a particular focus on driving high standards of governance, financial viability and value for money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julian Ashby, Chair of the &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; Regulation Committee said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The social housing sector is becoming increasingly complex. It is therefore imperative that members of the Regulation Committee - which is responsible for regulation of social housing providers in England - have the right mix of regulatory, financial, legal and commercial business expertise. The strong individuals appointed today will significantly strengthen the skills and experience available to the Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am also pleased that existing Committee members have had their initial appointments extended; a testament to the progress we have made as a Committee over the past 9 months. This brings stability and continuity to the Committee.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-details"&gt;Further details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; is the government agency tasked with supporting and enabling places to deliver their housing and regeneration needs and helping to drive local economic growth. &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; is also the regulator of social housing in England, exercising its regulatory functions through its statutory &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/regulation-committee"&gt;Regulation Committee&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appointments were made on open competition, conducted by the Department for Communities and Local Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="hca-regulation-committee"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; Regulation Committee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Adlington is the Senior Partner of Trowers &amp;amp; Hamlins. He also works as a partner in the firm’s Housing Projects department. He is due to retire from the firm in March 2013 at which point he will take up his position on the Regulation Committee. Jonathan’s appointment will be for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inge Kettner-Wood was the Chair of Charnwood Neighbourhood Housing (an Arms Length Management Organisation in Loughborough) until 31 October when it transferred back into the council. She has over 14 years of senior experience in the social housing sector, with extensive involvement in governance, regulation and finance issues, and more than 12 years experience as an auditor. Inge has been appointed for 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State has decided to reappoint Jane May (for 3 years), Richard Moriarty (for 3 years) and Piers Williamson (for 2 years) to the Regulation Committee upon the expiry of their current terms on 31 March 2013. Jim Coulter has chosen to step down and the process to recruit his successor will begin in the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remuneration for &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; Regulation Committee members is £11,000 for 2 days per month. Existing public servants forfeit any right to remuneration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the Regulation Committee have been appointed to varying term lengths in order to create a smoother appointments cycle in future years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Boost to councils and communities through the New Homes Bonus</title>
    <summary>The New Homes Bonus scheme pays over £1 billion to councils backing growth.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Council efforts to get Britain building are to be rewarded with a multi-million pound &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/new-homes-bonus" title="New Homes Bonus"&gt;New Homes Bonus&lt;/a&gt;, Housing Minister Mark Prisk announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next year, England’s 353 councils are set to share a cash payout of £661 million, after delivering 142,000 new homes, including 58,000 affordable properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This funding also rewards councils for bringing 13,000 long-term empty properties back into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s provisional allocation, to be paid in the 2013 to 2014 financial year, means councils will have received £1.3 billion through the New Homes Bonus scheme since its launch in April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This total recognises over 400,000 new builds and conversions, and over 50,000 empty properties being brought back into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister argued that the New Homes Bonus had proved critical in ensuring communities see the benefit of housing growth in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For years, developers found themselves at loggerheads with communities unconvinced that their plans for growth would benefit them. But the New Homes Bonus is turning this around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The £1.3 billion paid out to councils to date has meant that now local people are able to see the rewards of new developments in their area - paving the way for thousands of much-needed, locally-supported homes to be delivered across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="getting-britain-building"&gt;Getting Britain building&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils across the country have made the most of this additional funding to directly benefit their local communities. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Tyneside Council, which has allocated some of its New Homes Bonus funding towards a £3.1 million revamp of a library which overlooks a Georgian square in the heart of North Shields. The library scheme forms part of the regeneration of the square, which also includes the refurbishment of properties, bringing it back into residential use for the first time in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warwick Council, which has entered in a 10-year partnership with the Waterloo Housing Group to deliver new affordable homes in the area, with all New Homes Bonus payments generated by additional new homes built recycled back into the scheme to deliver additional housing and bring empty homes back into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uttlesford District Council is allocating some of its new Homes Bonus to fund a hi-tech shelter for teenagers in a new play park at Carver Barracks. Those using the shelter can generate their own power through crank handles located around the room, with the energy generated able to support the use of Bluetooth and MP3 players. The idea for the project came from a committee - The Rowney Community Park Fund - made up of soldiers’ wives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h3&gt;
