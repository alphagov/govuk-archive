    <title>Autumn statement: huge boost for transport</title>
    <summary>Transport projects funded as part of the Autumn statement 2012.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor announced funding for the following transport projects as part of the Autumn statement 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="scheme-a1-leeming-to-barton-improvements"&gt;Scheme: A1 Leeming to Barton improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £314 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upgrading the A1 between Leeming to Barton to motorway standard by upgrading a dual carriageway to a three lane road&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will create a continuous motorway standard route from Leeds to Newcastle and London to Newcastle (via M1/A1M)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it will also improve journey times between Leeming and Barton and over 60 years is predicted to save around 100 lives and prevent around 650 serious casualties as well as helping speed up the time it takes to clear up traffic incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;during construction it is estimated that at its peak up to 750 new jobs will be created in the construction industry over the three year construction period&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;completion of the scheme will support the economic competitiveness of the north-east and improve access to regional employment areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the reduction in journey times of some 20% will directly benefit business users, improving the attractiveness of these areas for future development and growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;works are planned to start in 2013/14 with the scheme open for traffic by 2016/17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-a5-m1-link-dunstable-northern-bypass"&gt;Scheme: A5-M1 link (Dunstable northern bypass)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £126.6 million (Department for Transport (DfT) contribution)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new dual two-lane road between the A5 (western end) and the M1 (eastern end) north of Dunstable and Houghton Regis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will remove through traffic between Dunstable and the M1 speeding up longer distance north south trips&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme will also unlock the development of 7,000 houses and 40 hectares of employment land – potentially providing 4,000 jobs – at Houghton Regis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work will start in 2014/15 with the scheme open for traffic in 2015/16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-a1-lobley-hill-improvement"&gt;Scheme: A1 Lobley Hill improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £64 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new roads in both directions parallel to the existing A1 between Lobley Hill and A184 in Gateshead&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme will provide an alternative route for local traffic improving congestion and accident rates on one of the most congested sections of the network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the government made a commitment through the Newcastle ‘City Deal’ process to work with local partners on considering proposals to address congestion on the A1 Newcastle/Gateshead western bypass – including proposals to deliver the Lobley Hill improvements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it also helps support local regeneration and development, including the creation of up to 22,000 new jobs, as the congestion is considered as a major constraint to expansion of regional employment and housing &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work is planned to start in 2014/15 with the scheme open for traffic by 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-highways-maintenance"&gt;Scheme: Highways maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £333 million &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dedicated fund for essential maintenance to renew, repair and extend life of road network in England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it will be used for improvements such as road resurfacing, maintenance to bridges, or repair damage caused by weather events, like recent floods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the money will be split between Highways Agency and local authorities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;details of how each area will benefit from this additional investment will be announced shortly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-strategic-road-pinch-point-fund"&gt;Scheme: Strategic road pinch point fund&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £100 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;additional funding for the Highways Agency’s pinch point fund to improve congestion and safety at bottlenecks on the strategic road network and facilitate local economic growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it will be used for improvements such as road widening and junction improvements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;schemes delivered as part of this programme will facilitate the creation of jobs and housing, improve access to enterprise zones and transport gateways that are within the vicinity of the scheme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Highways Agency will now work on identifying the specific projects that will benefit and make an announcement shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-local-pinch-point-fund"&gt;Scheme: Local pinch point fund&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £170 million &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fund to remove bottlenecks and support development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;schemes delivered as part of this programme will facilitate the creation of jobs and housing development, improve access to enterprise zones and transport gateways - this could include new access roads, junction improvements or bridge strengthening&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the fund is open to local transport authorities in England - guidance on how to apply for funding and timescales will be published shortly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;schemes considered will be ones that can be delivered quickly delivering an immediate impact on growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-a30-temple-to-carblake"&gt;Scheme: A30 Temple to Carblake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £60 million (£30 million DfT contribution and £30 million Cornwall Council contribution)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a 2.6 mile dualling of the existing single carriageway section of the A30 between Temple and Higher Carblake including changes to existing junctions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme will relieve congestion and improve journey times - it will also attract business growth and inward investment to Cornwall by improving links the rest of England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cornwall Council is proposing to deliver and part-fund the scheme on behalf of the Secretary of State&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work will start in 2014/2015 (subject to the completion of planning processes and funding agreements between Cornwall Council) with the scheme open for traffic in 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-accelerated-national-road-projects"&gt;Scheme: Accelerated national road projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £95 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the acceleration of three major motorway upgrades for M3 J2 to 4a, Surrey, M6 J10a to 13, West Midlands and M1 J28 to 31, Derbyshire to deliver the improvement schemes by spring 2015&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will result in increased capacity of 73 miles and reduced congestion through use of the hard shoulder as an extra lane&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vital improvements to the A160/A180 route to the port of Immingham will also be brought forward to start construction in the summer of 2015 (subject to the completion of statutory processes), with completion in autumn 2016 - cutting 18 months off the original construction timetable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-development-of-future-national-road-projects"&gt;Scheme: Development of future national road projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £42 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuing the development (detailed design, modelling and preparatory work) of future major road projects to maintain a pipeline of major road infrastructure proposals for delivery in the next spending review&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the development work will put in place the necessary preparatory work and analysis to ensure the Department for Transport can plan its future investments and ensure it is in a position to deliver vital future infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the development funding provides a contribution to UK job creation as it will be delivered in part through the transport supply chain &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the department has previously identified a number of future national road proposals and will announce in due course which schemes will have their development work funded, following a process of prioritisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-cycling-infrastructure-improvements"&gt;Scheme: Cycling infrastructure improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £42 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this funding will support infrastructure improvements that make it easier and safer for people get around their local areas by bicycle  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this could include more cycle lanes or tracks, improvements to junctions and signals, and cycle parking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;local authorities will design solutions best for their areas while keeping a strong focus on economic growth and carbon reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-m25-junction-30-improvements"&gt;Scheme: M25 junction 30 improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £150 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved interface between M25 junction 30 and the A13 making the Thames Gateway more attractive to prospective developers, and improving access to the Lakeside shopping centre and the Port of Tilbury &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Highways Agency will now work up detailed plans for the scheme but options being considered are widening of the A13 and increased capacity at the junction roundabout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will need to take account of the location of an additional crossing over the Lower Thames&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following scheme was also announced but will be funded from existing Highways Agency budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="scheme-m40-j12-improvement"&gt;Scheme: M40 J12 improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £10 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving the layout at J12 of the M40 near Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) facility which includes their Research and Development Centre and the Aston Martin Lagonda site &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme includes realignment of the slip roads and a local side road and the installation of traffic signals at the top of the slip roads -it will assist traffic using the M40 which includes over 6,000 vehicles travelling to and from the JLR site and improve safety at the junction by alleviating traffic queuing back onto the M40 at peak times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme supports local economic growth and will benefit the national economy by reducing localised congestion on this strategic route between the Midlands and the south-east - it will also improve safety &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme is being funded from existing Highways Agency budgets &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>West Coast Main Line: Final report of the Laidlaw inquiry</title>
    <summary>Final report of the Laidlaw inquiry released.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The independent inquiry into the cancelled West Coast Main Line franchise competition has concluded that the project failed because of an accumulation of significant errors related to inadequate planning and preparation, complex organisational structure, and a weak governance framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin asked Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica and a non-executive &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; board member, to conduct an urgent investigation following the discovery of unacceptable flaws in the procurement process that led to the competition being cancelled on October 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-laidlaw-inquiry"&gt;final report&lt;/a&gt;, published today by the Department for Transport, finds that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; used flawed and inconsistent methodology when guiding bidders on the amount of risk capital (known as the Subordinated Loan Facility) they would need to offer to guarantee their franchise against default (Inquiry report paragraph 4.31, p22)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Subordinated Loan Facility figures resulting from the flawed methodology were then varied in a way that contravened franchise competition rules (3.4, p11)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ministers made the original August 14 provisional contract award without being told about the critical flaws (2.12, p8) and having been given “inaccurate reports” (3.8, p12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Laidlaw Inquiry also concluded that: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the report’s recommendations to strengthen accountability and governance structures “if acted upon quickly and effectively, will help to restore confidence in the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;’s ability to conduct effective rail franchising and procurement” (paragraph 8.6, p79)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;while there were inconsistencies in the way First Group and Virgin Trains Ltd were treated during the franchise process, the report finds that there is no evidence of a culture of bias against Virgin at the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; (paragraph 2.6, p7)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is nothing in the report to suggest that the flaws discovered in this franchise competition exist in any other &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; procurements (paragraph 8.3, p79)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; is today publishing its formal response to the report which commits the department to implementing swiftly a series of actions that will enable it to resume the franchising programme, with the confidence of the rail industry, as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring future franchise competitions are delivered at a good pace based on sound planning, a clear timeline, rigorous management, and the right quality assurance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creating a simpler and clearer structure and governance process for rail franchise competitions, including the appointment of a single director general with responsibility for all rail policy and franchising&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensuring we have the right mix of professional skills, in-house, and where necessary from professional external advisers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Laidlaw said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Building upon and confirming the conclusions from my initial findings, the final report provides an in-depth analysis of the events that led to the flaws whereby the InterCity West Coast competition was cancelled. Alongside this I have also made a series of recommendations for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have explained in detail the technical nature of certain errors, specifically around modelling flaws and the Subordinated Loan Facility sizing process. In addition, the report outlines an accumulation of contributory causes including a lack of transparency, inadequate planning and preparation, as well as a complex and confusing organisational structure with weak quality assurance and insufficient governance oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While it is clear that a number of serious and regrettable errors have occurred, I believe that if acted upon quickly and effectively, my recommendations will help to restore confidence in the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;’s ability to conduct effective rail franchising and procurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick McLoughlin said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The final report from the Laidlaw inquiry makes extremely uncomfortable reading for the department. It has identified precisely what went wrong, revealing serious failures, as well as offering us a number of sensible recommendations to put things right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will not allow these mistakes to be made again and the department is determined to ensure all future franchise competitions are conducted on the basis of sound planning, the rigorous identification and oversight of risk, and the right quality assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sam Laidlaw has delivered an uncompromising report that offers us a way to face up to a number of shortcomings and I would like to thank him and his team for producing these findings with such diligence and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; Permanent Secretary Philip Rutnam said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no question that this has been a serious blow for the department and I am determined that we learn everything we can from this episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will implement all of Mr Laidlaw’s recommendations, and go further, to ensure we have the right set of skills, support and training to ensure failures like this do not happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

It will also take into account the forthcoming &lt;abbr title="National Audit Office"&gt;NAO&lt;/abbr&gt; report into the lessons from the cancellation of the InterCity West Coast franchise and the conclusions of Richard Brown’s review of the future of the rail franchising programme, due to be submitted to the Secretary of State by the end of December&lt;/li&gt;

    <summary>Philip Rutnam statement concerning West Coast Main Line</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Department for Transport Permanent Secretary Philip Rutnam yesterday received the report of the investigation into the role and conduct of officials in the award process for the ICWC franchise process conducted by Bill Stow (a former Director General at Defra). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is now considering the report and decisions on action following this investigation will be made shortly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Permanent Secretary decided yesterday to lift the suspensions of three DfT officials imposed on the 3 October. The decision to suspend a member of staff, or to lift that suspension, is separate from the disciplinary process and does not imply any conclusion on culpability.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government investment in local growth to continue</title>
    <summary>The Chancellor has announced a package of measures in his Autumn Statement that will help the department continue to boost local growth.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures will enable the country to build new homes, deliver key infrastructure and support vital jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new £474 million Local Infrastructure Fund that will support investment in key local projects will open up new development, including locally supported large housing sites and bring surplus public land back into use, delivering much needed new homes, businesses, infrastructure and local transport schemes. Plus a further £100 million to bring forward public sector sites for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures announced in the Autumn Statement and the September Housing and Planning package will support delivery of up to 120,000 homes. There will also be cash injections for local areas through a £1.5 billion borrowing arrangement for local enterprise partnerships and more money for the Regional Growth Fund. While small firms will continue to receive larger business rate tax breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-investment-in-local-infrastructure"&gt;New investment in local infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around £225 million will be used to accelerate delivery of locally supported large housing sites, supporting around 50,000 homes. There are many locally supported large housing schemes in the development pipeline that can provide real benefits to local communities that are struggling to move forward because of the current economic circumstances. This fund will help unlock those stalled sites so they become shovel ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around £190 million of the funding will be used to enable the quicker disposal of surplus public sector land for new homes. Alongside this, the Government will provide £100 million to bring forward public sector sites for development. Government has identified enough land for over 106,000 homes and has already sold around 33,000. The Home and Communities Agency will become a single ‘shop window’ for land disposal so much needed homes can be built on these sites sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around £60 million of this will be made available to support infrastructure in a limited number of enterprise zones. Building work has already begun on 20 zones and the majority have put in place simplified planning arrangements and secured private sector investment. The fund will help accelerate the infrastructure preparations so that new businesses can open and more new jobs are created as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from Lord Heseltine’s report which recommended devolution of more economic powers, local enterprise partnerships will be able to borrow up to £1.5 billion at cheap rates for nominated infrastructure projects. This puts partnerships and councils in much greater control over the levers of growth. They are already putting the Growing Places Fund to good use supporting 169 projects in the first 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government will also pump an additional £350 million into the Regional Growth Fund, including a new £210 million to support jobs and growth across England - bringing the total fund to £2.6 billion. In addition, a new £170 million Department for Transport local transport pinch point fund, to unlock new development, homes and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="extra-support-for-business-continues"&gt;Extra support for business continues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the need to tackle the deficit there continues to be no real terms increases in business rates and inflation has fallen easing pressure further. The government will provide a further one year extension of the temporary doubling of small business rate relief to an estimated half a million business properties. In addition councils can now offer extra discounts to support local business and the 24 enterprise zones offer special 100% rate discounts to new firms that create local jobs. Postponing a revaluation will avoid local firms and local shops facing unexpected hikes in their business-rates bills over the next 5 years. Early estimates suggest that 800,000 premises faced a real-terms rise in their bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chancellor also announced a new temporary measure to extend the time period for the exemption from empty property rates, for newly built property for 18 months which will support construction. This will help promote regeneration and support high street renewal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="efficiency-savings-to-continue"&gt;Efficiency savings to continue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the government’s fiscal plans the new investment in the economy will, in part, be funded by some government departments’ resource budgets being reduced. The Department for Communites and Local Government has already become a smaller, streamlined, more flexible organisation. Its administration spending will reduce in real terms by 44% having reduced headcount by 37%. Arms length bodies have been reduced from 26 to 13 and the government office regions have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local government has been exempt from the reduction in 2013-2014 in recognition that local authorities are holding down budgets by comparable amounts by keeping council tax low in that year. This important concession will allow local authorities time in 2013-2014 to continue to protect frontline services by delivering reforms that will drive through further savings through transforming service delivery as demonstrated by the whole-place community budget pilots. Full details of local government funding for next year will be announced in the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement due later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Virgin Trains to run improved west coast services</title>
    <summary>Virgin Trains to continue operating rail services on the West Coast Main Line for up to 23 months.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail passengers will experience better services including 28,000 more seats a day under an agreement announced today for Virgin Trains to continue operating rail services on the West Coast Main Line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new franchise agreement will run for up to 23 months after which the West Coast Main Line will be let under a long-term franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It coincides with the early completion of a government-backed deal to roll out 106 new Pendolino carriages, providing passengers with four new 11-carriage trains and lengthening 31 existing trains from nine carriages to 11. A new hourly service between London and Glasgow will also be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick McLoughlin said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are determined to ensure not only that passengers continue to experience the same levels of service they have in the past, but that services improve. There will be a new hourly service linking Glasgow and London and we will also work with Virgin Trains to explore other service improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am also extremely pleased that passengers will benefit from up to 28,000 more seats daily thanks to the delivery of 106 new Pendolino carriages onto the West Coast Main Line which has happened on budget and ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passengers travelling on Virgin Trains will also find it easier to claim compensation if their train is severely delayed thanks to plans for Virgin Trains to introduce an improved passenger’s charter incorporating a delay repay scheme from 1 April 2013, subject to agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-for-editors"&gt;Notes for editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 23 month franchise will run from 9 December 2012 until 9 November 2014 after which the West Coast Main Line will be let under a long-term franchise. The Department for Transport (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;) will be able to shorten this period by up to six months if a subsequent franchise can be let on a shorter timescale.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The franchise will operate as a management contract with both revenue and cost risk being borne by the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;. In return Virgin Rail Group (&lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt;) will receive a margin of 1% on revenue for operating services. The franchise also makes a provision for the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt; to agree revised commercial terms that would see &lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt; take greater revenue and cost risk in the period to 9 November 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 106 Pendolino carriages project has been delivered on budget and ahead of schedule and has resulted from a successful collaboration between the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;, Virgin Trains, Alstom, Angel Trains and Network Rail.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>InterCity West Coast franchise</title>
    <summary>Virgin Trains to continue to operate services on the West Coast Main Line. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 15 October 2012 I announced to the House that following the cancellation of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition the Department for Transport was commencing negotiations with Virgin Rail Group (&lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can today announce that negotiations have concluded successfully and that Virgin Trains will continue to operate services on the West Coast Main Line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After careful consideration I believe taxpayers, rail passengers and the wider rail industry will be better served by moving directly from this agreement with &lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt; to a longer term franchise on the West Coast Main Line. Doing so will provide greater certainty for passengers, minimise disruption for all stakeholders and enable us to maximise the benefits for taxpayers and West Coast passengers. For this reason the new franchise with &lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt; will be for up to 23 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also pleased to announce that passengers will not only experience the same levels of service they have previously enjoyed but will also benefit from improvements to previous levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition this agreement coincides with the successful completion today, on budget and ahead of schedule, of a project to deliver 106 new Pendolino carriages onto the West Coast Main Line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new carriages, which will see up to 28,000 extra seats provided each day, are being introduced with £1.5 billion of government support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the new franchise agreement, there will also be a new hourly service between London and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This franchise will operate as a management contract, with both revenue and cost risk being borne by the government. In return &lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt; will receive a margin of 1% on revenue. The contract also makes a provision for the department and &lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt; to agree revised commercial terms that would see &lt;abbr title="Virgin Rail Group"&gt;VRG&lt;/abbr&gt; take greater revenue and cost risk in the period to 9 November 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Waterborne freight in the United Kingdom: 2011</title>
    <summary>This statistical release presents information on freight moved within the United Kingdom by water transport in 2011.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication provides information on freight traffic moved within the United Kingdom by water transport, known as ‘domestic waterborne freight’. The statistics cover inland waters traffic, traffic carried around the UK coast (Coastwise), one-port traffic to and from offshore installations and sea dredging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics are produced from a combination of the sources for our ‘Port Freight Statistics’ and an independent survey of inland waterway operators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 2010 and 2011, goods lifted for all domestic waterborne freight fell by 2%, the sixth consecutive year of decline. However goods moved for all domestic waterborne freight rose by 3%, the first annual increase since 2005. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coastwise traffic (i.e. traffic carried around the UK coast) remains the largest component of domestic waterborne freight. Despite a fall in the amount of goods lifted by coastwise traffic, the amount of goods moved increased by 4.5% from 2010 to 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011, traffic on UK inland waters was stable compared to 2010, with 43.9 million tonnes lifted and 1.4 billion tonne-kilometres moved.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Despite a steady decline since 2002, there was an increase in one-port traffic (i.e. to and from offshore installations and sea dredging) in 2011 of 6%, from 20.3 million tonnes lifted in 2010 to 21.6 million tonnes lifted in 2011. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="technical-information"&gt;Technical information:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on Domestic Waterborne Freight statistics, including the pre-release access list and related technical documentation &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/technical-guidance-for-transport-stats#domestic-waterborne-freight-statistics"&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
