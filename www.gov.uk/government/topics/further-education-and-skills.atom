    <summary>Introducing a new FE funding system, improving teacher training and apprenticeships
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The further education (&lt;abbr title="Further education"&gt;FE&lt;/abbr&gt;) system – the colleges and training providers that teach vocational qualifications and skills – needs to guarantee students high quality teaching and courses to help students into jobs or university and create the skilled workforce employers need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve quality and efficiency in &lt;abbr title="Further education"&gt;FE&lt;/abbr&gt; and skills training, the government is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility for funding post-16 learning in England is shared between the Department for Education (16-18 year olds) and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (19 year olds and over).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2011, an independent review of further education, &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/The%20Wolf%20Report.pdf"&gt;the Review of Vocational Education&lt;/a&gt; made a number of recommendations including that we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move to ‘per-student’ funding instead of ‘per-qualification’ funding, to make institutions more accountable to learners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve the quality of apprenticeships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government then carried out a public consultation to invite opinions on these recommendations &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/new-challenges-new-chances-next-steps-in-implementing-the-further-education-reform-programme"&gt;New challenges, new chances: next steps in implementing the further education reform programme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the responses to the consultation, the government published its plans, in December 2011, for the &lt;abbr title="Further education"&gt;FE&lt;/abbr&gt; sector in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-investment-statement-for-2011-to-2014-new-challenges-new-chances" title="New challenges, new chances: further education system and skills reform plan"&gt;New challenges, new chances: further education system and skills reform plan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will shortly publish an update on ‘New challenges, new chances’. This will explain the progress we have made in reforming the further education and skills system. We have already published a number of reports and plans on aspects of the system, including: &lt;/p&gt;

It means that &lt;abbr title="Further education"&gt;FE&lt;/abbr&gt; colleges can now borrow money without needing permission from the government. Colleges can also change the way they govern themselves, and those rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted no longer have to face routine inspections. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boosting skills and jobs on the south coast</title>
    <summary>Following the Autumn Statement, Vince Cable visited Southampton to launch two schemes to improve skills and create sustainable employment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Cable was in Southampton to launch two key schemes to improve skills and create sustainable employment, following on from new investment launched in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/as2012_index.htm"&gt;Chancellor’s Autumn Statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He visited Eastleigh College to announce a new £550 million Further Education Capital Investment Fund to help improve college facilities across the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That investment  will be targeted towards colleges in the greatest need of help to improve facilities, improve efficiency and save money in the long term. Colleges will be able to apply for funding through the Skills Funding Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extra £310 million for the Regional Growth Fund to create and safeguard jobs was also announced in the Autumn Statement.  To date, £2.4 billion has been conditionally offered to businesses and intermediaries up and down the country – creating jobs and boosting the local economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The south coast has benefited from a number of different Regional Growth Fund projects and programmes. The Solent LEP has been awarded £2m from the Regional Growth Fund to roll out the second phase of the successful Bridging the Gap Funding programme to Southampton and the Isle of Wight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other beneficiaries of Regional Growth Fund awards for the area include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Southampton City Council has been awarded a further £5.3 million Regional Growth Fund in support of the ‘Platform for Prosperity’ project bringing the total to £10.9 million. The project entails the improvement and upgrade of the road infrastructure outside Eastern Docks and is expected to create or safeguard over 800 jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cobra Precision Engineering and Elite Care Homes are two of the first recipients of £100,000 of phase one of the Solent LEPs Bridging the Gap award. The grant will leverage close to £600,000 additional private investment and create and safeguard 12 jobs at the two firms. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Solent Future’s project is a £13m Regional Growth Fund money investment from Round 3. Part of the funding will be utilised to ensure a sustainable future for the Advanced Manufacturing skills in the Solent workforce. This will bring together leading businesses, colleges and Universities at a world-class training centre on the Solent Enterprise Zone. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Portsmouth Naval Base Property Trust in Portsmouth secured £1.23 million of Regional Growth Fund to support two projects within the Historic Dockyard at Portsmouth. 
£750,000 will be used to develop the Cell Block Enterprise project which will support enterprise skills development and provide access to early stage funding with mentoring managed by the University of Portsmouth. The project aims to create over 440 jobs in the supply chain. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£475,000 will contribute to the development of the International Boatbuilding Training College (IBTC) which combines heritage conservation with apprenticeships and other training to develop transferrable skills. The project has also had initial support from the Heritage Lottery Fund which could result in a final grant of £3.9 million grant to help support the development of heritage skills for the future. Both projects will have a ten year economic life cycle. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Autumn Statement 2012</title>
    <summary>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has delivered his 2012 Autumn Statement to Parliament.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Autumn Statement is one of two major statements the Treasury has to give to parliament every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Statement provides an update on the Government’s plans for the economy based on the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. These forecasts are published alongside the Autumn Statement on 5 December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From today’s update of the government’s spending plans, the Department for Business has secured £2.4 billion of additional funding to support growth, with a focus on skills and science projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This money reinforces the government’s commitment to plan for medium and long term recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will aid the development of an industrial strategy to shape and rebalance our economy, in partnership with business. This will drive growth, create the jobs of the future and help us get ahead in the global race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="main-announcements-for-bis"&gt;Main announcements for BIS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An additional £600 million for science, research and innovation, which takes the total investment since the 2010 spending review to an additional £1.5 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extra £270 million to be spent on laboratories, classrooms and other facilities in our Further Education colleges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£1 billion confirmed for the business bank, which will address the long-term structural gap in lending to small businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extra £120 million invested in supply chains, to encourage companies to invest here in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Regional Growth Fund will also receive an additional £350 million, bringing the total available in 2012-13 to £2.75 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first stage of the government’s response to Lord Heseltine’s independent review on economic growth, ‘No Stone Unturned’.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra money for the Employer Ownership Pilot, taking it to £340 million overall and giving businesses funding so they can design and develop their own training programmes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased funding of £140 million for UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI) to help small and medium sized business export abroad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£1.5 billion to help our smallest companies to access growing markets overseas. For the first time UK Export Finance, the Government’s export credit agency, will be able to issue loans to overseas customers and buyers wanting to purchase goods from UK businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A package of measures to cut back red tape that business has told government stops them from growing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="science-and-innovation"&gt;Science and Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the Spending Review in 2010 the yearly £4.6 billion funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms and ring-fenced during the spending review period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra £600 million announced today will be invested in facilities for technological research and development and Research Council infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This amounts to an additional £1.5 billion of capital funding for science, research and innovation since the beginning of the Review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This investment will support the development of innovative technologies and strengthen the UK‘s competitive advantage in areas such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big data and energy efficient computing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advanced materials.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Energy storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details about how the £600 million will be spent will be published in due course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Science budget will continue to be protected and ring-fenced for the rest of the Spending Review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Richard Review of Apprenticeships</title>
    <summary>Entrepreneur and educator Doug Richard publishes his independent report on the future of apprenticeships.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;27 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his independent report Doug Richard calls on the government calls to improve the quality of apprenticeships and make them more focused on the needs of employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His recommendations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redefining apprenticeships: They should be targeted only at those who are new to a job or role that requires sustained and substantial training. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focusing on the outcome of an apprenticeship - what the apprentice can do when they complete their training - and freeing up the process by which they get there. Trusted, independent assessment is key. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recognised industry standards should form the basis of every apprenticeship. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All apprentices should reach a good level in English and maths before they can complete their apprenticeship. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Government funding must create the right incentives for apprenticeship training. The purchasing power for investing in apprenticeship training should lie with the employer. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greater diversity and innovation in training - with employers and government safeguarding quality.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the launch of his review, Doug Richard said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No matter who I speak with, everyone agrees that apprenticeships are a good thing - but only when they are ‘true’ apprenticeships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With the myriad of learning experiences which are currently labelled as apprenticeships, we risk losing sight of the core features of what makes apprenticeships work so my conclusion is that we need to look again at what it means to be an apprentice and what it means to offer an apprenticeship as an employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Apprenticeships need to be high quality training with serious kudos and tangible value both to the apprentice and the employer. I want to hear about an 18 year old who looked at their options and turned down a place at Oxbridge to take up an apprenticeship if that is the right path for them. And I want to hear that their parents were thrilled.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need to make sure that apprenticeships are the success story they deserve to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has welcomed the report. Business Secretary Vince Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Doug Richard’s review echoes the Government’s current thinking on putting employers in the driving seat of our apprenticeship programme. This will be vital to ensure the skills of our workforce fit with employer needs.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“His recommendations will help us to build on the current successes of our apprenticeships programme and tailor a programme which is sustainable, high-quality and meets the changing needs of our economy in the decades to come”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>£400 million boost to England's colleges</title>
    <summary>£400 million will be spent at a number of English colleges to upgrade facilities and resources, with £110 million coming from the Government.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;21 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects at 56 English colleges range from the launch of a state-of-the-art civil engineering academy, to transforming classrooms into vocational workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the announcement at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.aoc.co.uk/"&gt;Association of Colleges (AoC)&lt;/a&gt; Conference, Business Secretary Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These projects will transform the learning environment for thousands of students across the country, providing them with state-of-the-art facilities and modern resources that will help them fulfil their potential.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Addressing gaps in skills is an important part of our industrial strategy. This initiative is another example of how Government is working in long-term partnership with industry to give them more confidence to invest, hire and grow.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of succesful bids include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South Essex College of Further and Higher Education raising almost £40 million which will be combined with nearly £3 million grant support to build a new town centre site. It will have facilities ranging from mechanical engineering workshops to student training kitchens.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new £4 million agriculture building at Bridgwater College in Somerset which will address the growing demand for specialist rural skills and develop closer links with the agriculture industry in the region.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new £7.7 million creative industries building at Kingston College.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£8.1 million on refurbishing the campus and building new arts facilities at Burton and South Derbyshire College. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government is investing £110 million, through the Skills Funding Agency, which is matched with £302 million investment from colleges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May this year all colleges were invited to apply for up to £3 million for individual projects, with an expectation that the facilities will be ready to use by September 2014. The resources are aimed at colleges that have not received significant funding in the recent past. &lt;/p&gt;
