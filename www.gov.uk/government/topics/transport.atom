    <title>Revisions to the levels of funding required by goods and public service vehicle licence holders</title>
    <summary>Revised figures announced for holders of goods and public service vehicle licences operating for hire or reward.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport has given notice of revisions to the levels of funding required by holders of goods and public service vehicle operators’ licences operating for hire or reward. This is a requirement of EU Regulation 1071/2009 which affects holders of standard national and standard international licences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Traffic Commissioners retain their discretion to set the financial standing levels for restricted licence holders (not covered by the regulation) and they propose to maintain the current rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised figures are set out below and are based on the euro exchange rate on the first working day in October 2012 – as prescribed by EU Regulation 1071/2009. The new rates will come into force on 1 January 2013 and will remain in place until the 31 December 2013 (previous rates are in brackets). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Minimum financial level requirement&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Standard national and standard international licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£7,200 (£7,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£4,000, ( £4,200)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Restricted licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£3,100 ( £3,100)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£1,700 ( £1,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial limits set by EU Regulation 1071/2009 are 9000 euros for the first vehicle and 5000 euros for each subsequent vehicle. For member states not participating in monetary union, the regulation requires the equivalent in their currencies to be revised every year, using the euro exchange rate published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the first working day of October in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Transport for everyone </title>
    <summary>Putting accessibility and equality front and centre when delivering services for the travelling public.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker is calling on operators and local authorities to work with government to put accessibility and equality front and centre when delivering services for the travelling public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help them to do this, the Department for Transport has published 2 action plans which set out priorities, as well as highlighting areas where action is in the pipeline or already underway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Transport for everyone’ outlines how operators, local councils and the Department can help to make it easier for people using public transport – particularly those with disabilities - to get to where they need to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This action plan builds on the success achieved in improving accessibility on public transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. At the heart of the plan is the importance of improving door-to-door journeys rather than addressing issues in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department’s equality action plan looks at how we can encourage a more inclusive transport network and underlines the importance of ensuring that policy makers at all levels are alive to the particular needs and concerns of different groups in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include affordability issues for young people and pensioners and the ability for all people to travel in safety and free from harassment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A good transport system allows people to access jobs, opportunities and vital services - it needs to work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recognise the concerns that specific groups of people have about public transport and so we have pulled together ideas from across the transport sector on how these concerns can be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The action plans will help policy makers, as well as transport operators, to tackle problems head on and - more importantly - to level the playing field for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liz Sayce OBE, Disability Rights UK Chief Executive, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An accessible transport infrastructure is essential for what Disability Rights UK wants to achieve – disabled people playing a full and equal part in society. Over the past 20 years we have come a long way as our practical guide ‘Doing transport differently’ shows but there are still too many attitudinal, communication and physical barriers facing disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Action plan’ is a step change towards making further progress. We welcome the commitment that the Department for Transport will continue to work in partnership with disabled people and our organisations to ensure the most effective steps are taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Accessibility action plan’ builds on the transport successes of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and aims to create a long lasting legacy of improved access and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Olympic and Paralympic Games, public transport operators carried thousands of spectators with disabilities and work was done to ensure that the travelling public had easy access to information. One of the aims of the ‘Accessibility action plan’ will be to build on the Games Spectator Journey Planner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new planner would cover a wider geographical area and more types of transport as well as being made accessible to people with visual impairments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other measures outlined in the plan include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;considering where £100 million of extra funding might be best spent in the long term to improve accessibility of railway stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;possible further amendments to the Blue Badge scheme to tackle abuse and fraud in this area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building on guidance for mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs to encourage training for those using this equipment &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Equality action plan’ sets out in one place what the department is doing to ensure people from all parts of society have the option to use public transport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points addressed in the plan include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessibility to public transport for young people, older people and those living in rural areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;safety and personal security for women travellers, particularly at night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tackling hate crime and bullying on buses and other public transport &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promoting employment of under-represented groups within the transport industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both documents include lists of issues and the actions that have been, or will be, taken to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government accepts proposals to improve garage standards</title>
    <summary>Motorists encouraged to check their garage is industry-standard approved.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorists are being encouraged to find out if their garage is approved by a set of industry-standard codes to make sure they are getting value for money.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call comes after the government accepted a number of proposals made by industry experts to help drive up standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Motorists’ Forum has set out a raft of recommendations aimed at making sure motorists have the best possible consumer experience when having their vehicles serviced or repaired in a report released today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will promote the wider adoption of self-regulation (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;-&lt;abbr title="Trading Standards Institute"&gt;TSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) codes of practice by garages and encourage greater publication of information regarding services they offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an AA survey*, 78% of people always use the same garage meaning that only a minority of motorists shop around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the work carried out by the Motorists’ Forum and believe the recommendations will help build on existing best practice in the industry without the burden of extra legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important that consumers feel confident in the quality and the value for money of the services they are receiving from garages. The Forum’s report has offered some useful proposals for how this can be achieved more consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would urge motorists to find out if their local garage has been approved by the codes to ensure they are getting a fair service and value for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will now use their strong relationships with the industry and stakeholders to promote the adopted recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK car service and repair sector is worth around £6.9 billion per year to the GB economy with 150,000 MOT tests taking place every working day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Motorists’ Forum report on garage customer experience can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-report-of-the-motorists-forum-sub-group-on-improving-customer-service-experience-at-garages"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s response can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-motorists-forum-report-on-garage-customer-experience"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Motorists’ Forum is made up of a group of experts convened by the DfT. Organisations include the AA, RAC, &lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, Centre for Automotive Management, &lt;abbr title="compulsory basic training"&gt;CBT&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Transport for London"&gt;TfL&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Association Of British Insurers"&gt;ABI&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Freight Transport Association"&gt;FTA&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association"&gt;BVRLA&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety"&gt;PACTS&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders"&gt;SMMT&lt;/abbr&gt; as well as representatives from the DfT and Highways Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Trading Standards Institute (&lt;abbr title="Trading Standards Institute"&gt;TSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) will be taking over responsibility for the consumer codes approval scheme from the Office of Fair Trading (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;). The new scheme will maintain the rigour of the current scheme, but will streamline the approval process and make it self-funding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responsibility for vehicle roadworthiness and testing lies with DfT and &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; administers the MOT scheme. Responsibility for consumer protection legislation lies with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is already considerable consumer protection legislation in place to cover the practices of garages which choose to trade unfairly or who are not competent to trade; both from the perspective of individual consumer rights through sale of goods and services legislation, and through the application of criminal sanctions, principally via the Consumer Protection from unfair trading regulations&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Improving motoring services</title>
    <summary>Consultation to suggest improvements about how motoring services are delivered.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Road users, businesses and other stakeholders were today invited to suggest improvements to the way motoring services such as driving tests and vehicle licensing are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is putting customers firmly at the heart of the way motoring services are delivered so that they best serve the consumer while getting the best possible deal for the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the Department for Transport is outlining broad reform proposals for the 4 motoring services agencies: Driving Standards Agency (DSA); Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA); Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) and the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roads Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you drive, run a business or pay taxes you will be a customer of ours and I hope you will have your say about how we can improve the services we offer you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much progress has already been achieved and it is now much easier to use digital services to get driving licences, and sort out vehicle tax. We have also already announced that we are bringing the driving test closer to customers by exploring a range of different locations, such as colleges and retail premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But there is more that can be done and this consultation is about the government listening to its customers before agreeing the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department’s 4 agencies are already engaged in programmes of reform to deliver long term financial stability and efficiency, and better services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation sets out a longer term view of the future of these reforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Position the agencies at the forefront of digital services, ensuring that those who find access to digital services difficult are supported to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support economic growth and vehicle manufacturing by reforming the Vehicle Certification Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring the driving test closer to the customer by exploring opportunities to improve convenience to customers. This includes assessing options for the delivery of the practical test. We are keen to explore all options that maintain the integrity of the test and high quality standards whoever is the provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transform &lt;abbr title="heaviy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt;, bus and coach testing by expanding joint ventures and collaboration with private sector providers, and reducing the number of government owned test stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliver better customer services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider rationalising the number of bodies and agencies involved in delivering services - delivering services as simply as possible, increasing flexibility and innovation, improving efficiency and reducing costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 7 March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation is the department’s response to the government’s broader vision for public services as set out in the civil service reform plan, the Open Public Services white paper and the government digital strategy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The consultation document can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/motoring-services-strategy"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisional data show that 82.3% of journeys made on Highways Agency managed roads between November 2011 and October 2012 were ‘on time’. This is 0.3 percentage points lower than the previous rolling year, ending in September 2012..&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During October 2012, provisional data show that 79.6% of journeys on Highways Agency’s motorway and ‘A’ road network were ‘on time’. This is 3.4 percentage points lower than the equivalent figure for October 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The annual reliability measure consistently increased up to March 2012, but has fallen in the last seven months, and has now dropped below the level observed at the end of 2011. The recent downward trend in reliability reflects the substantial amount of rainfall experienced since spring compared with the same period in 2011. In fact, rainfall in each of the last seven months has been higher in 2012 compared to the same month in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background-information"&gt;Background information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indicator monitors the reliability of journeys made on Highways Agency’s motorway and A road network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indicator is measured by the percentage of ‘journeys’ on these roads that are ‘on time’. For this measure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a ‘journey’ represents travel between adjacent junctions on the network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an ‘on time journey’ is defined as one which is completed within a set reference time, drawn from historic data on that particular section of road&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reference journey times are updated for the April data each year - further information on the impact of updating reference times can be found in section 3 of the latest &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/road-congestion-and-reliability-statistics"&gt;statistical release&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, information about the reliability of journeys on individual routes, or between particular junctions on the network, are not sufficiently robust to be presented as official statistics. This is due to the range of different sources used to calculate journey times across the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department is working with the Highways Agency to address these issues of comparability. It is likely that any actions to address these issues will also require some historic adjustment to the national series although the trends reported in national reliability to date are unlikely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this programme is complete, the Highways Agency will publish information about journey time reliability at a sub-national level through the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://data.gov.uk"&gt;data.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Accessibility action plan and equality action plan</title>
    <summary>Release of the accessibility action plan and equality action plan.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today pleased to be publishing the department’s accessibility action plan &lt;a href="/government/publications/accessibility-action-plan"&gt;‘Transport for Everyone: an action plan to improve accessibility for all’&lt;/a&gt;, and, for comment, a draft &lt;a href="/government/publications/equality-action-plan"&gt;equality action plan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has already been achieved in making transport more accessible, and the accessibility action plan seeks to address the challenges that remain. In doing so, we also want to draw on the success of the Olympic and Paralympic Games which demonstrated what can be done to provide those using our public transport system with a positive experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accessibility action plan focuses not only on improving physical accessibility, but also on providing better information for the traveller, and on improving attitudes and behaviour, especially towards disabled passengers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In identifying our priorities in the action plan, we have worked with a large number of representative organisations, individuals, transport operators and local authorities. I am grateful for the support and input that they have provided.  We want transport to be accessible by all and the plan moves us further towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equality action plan presents some of the activities we are undertaking to meet our duties under the equalities legislation, and provides an initial set of priorities for promoting equality and well-being, based on the evidence we have gathered and the engagement we have already had with transport organisations and other interested parties. We are seeking comments on this initial draft and will publish a final version following further engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
