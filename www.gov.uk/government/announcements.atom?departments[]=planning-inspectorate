    <title>The new home on the web for DFT and DCLG</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DFT&lt;/abbr&gt;) and the Department for Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;), along with 3 of their public bodies, have today (15 November, 2012) become the first central government organisations to move their corporate and policy content onto the new GOV.UK website - the new single home for all government services and information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inside Government section on GOV.UK makes it simpler, clearer and faster to find out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how government works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what the government is doing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how you can get involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="new-web-addresses"&gt;New web addresses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All web addresses have been redirected, so you don’t need to update your bookmarks, but you might want to make a note of the new addresses: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/dclg" title="DCLG"&gt;www.gov.uk/dclg&lt;/a&gt; - Department for Communities and Local Government&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/dft" title="DFT"&gt;www.gov.uk/dft&lt;/a&gt; - Department for Transport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/dsa" title="DSA"&gt;www.gov.uk/dsa&lt;/a&gt; - Driving Standards Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/brac" title="BRAC"&gt;www.gov.uk/brac&lt;/a&gt; - Building Regulations Advisory Committee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/pins" title="PINS"&gt;www.gov.uk/pins&lt;/a&gt; - The Planning Inspectorate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inside Government section of GOV.UK has been designed to make government information more easy to find and more transparent for the user. For the first time, you can begin to find out what’s happening inside government all in one place, and in a clear, consistent and transparent format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the new website looks very different from the ones it has replaced. The look is one obvious difference but many of the other significant changes are less visible.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="topics"&gt;Topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now see information from multiple government departments grouped by topics. For example, you can see how policies from both &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DFT&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; are contributing to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topics/economic-growth"&gt;economic growth&lt;/a&gt; or combating &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topics/climate-change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="clear-policies"&gt;Clear policies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From today, those departments and agencies who have moved to GOV.UK are publishing their policies according to the outcome the government is trying to achieve. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-roads-safer" title="making roads safer"&gt;making roads safer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-greenhouse-gases-and-other-emissions-from-transport" title="reducing greenhouse gases and other emissions from transport"&gt;reducing greenhouse gases and other emissions from transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes" title="increasing the number of available homes"&gt;increasing the number of available homes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each policy, you can see a list of all the related announcements, consultations and publications in one list, called ‘activity’. The activity tab makes it easy for you to track what is happening on the policies that interest you, for example all government activity that relates to &lt;a href="/government/policies/developing-a-new-high-speed-rail-network/activity" title="developing a high speed rail network: activity"&gt;developing a high speed rail network&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="more-about-inside-government-and-govuk"&gt;More about Inside Government and GOV.UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you see today is just the beginning, with just 2 departments and 3 other organisations live. Work will continue as other departments and organisations, many hundreds in total, move their information to GOV.UK. This will happen in batches and will be completed by March 2014.     &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Planning Inspectorate essential to new planning measures</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government recently announced a number of new measures in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/growthandinfrastructure.html"&gt;Growth and Infrastructure Bill&lt;/a&gt; to reduce confusing and overlapping red tape that delays and discourages business investment, new infrastructure and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Boles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“New planning measures will put the Planning Inspectorate centre stage in ensuring we have a swift and effective planning system that helps boost local economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By expanding permitted development rights, cutting red tape and streamlining the planning process we can save householders money and help businesses create jobs and compete.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his first visit to the Inspectorate in Bristol on Thursday, the minister discussed the work of planning inspectors with Inspectorate Chief Executive Sir Michael Pitt and toured the National Infrastructure Division and Planning Appeals Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Response to Daily Telegraph article about guidance issued by the Planning Inspectorate on draft planning reforms</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Department for Communities and Local Government said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Department did not instruct the Planning Inspectorate to issue guidance about the draft National Planning Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ministers have already asked Sir Michael Pitt, the Chief Executive, to come to see them tomorrow to make clear that in their work his inspectors should respect the fact that this is a document out for consultation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Michael Pitt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Planning Inspectorate did not produce this guidance under instruction from the department. It did so as a matter of normal procedure simply stating what always applies when draft policy is issued for consultation and to ensure common understanding for Inspectors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
