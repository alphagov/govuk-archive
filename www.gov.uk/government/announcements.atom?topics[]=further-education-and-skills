    <title>Press Release: Graduate apprenticeships for the professions introduced</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graduate and post-graduate level apprenticeships will soon be available in subjects including law, accountancy and advanced engineering, Skills Minister Matthew Hancock announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From next year, changes to the Specification of Apprentices Standards for England (SASE) will mean that level six and seven apprenticeships – equivalent to bachelors and masters degree level – are available for the first time, making vocational learning an attractive alternative to the traditional higher education route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already a number of these top-level schemes in development, including in accountancy, law and human resources. BPP Law School is looking to develop a Legal Apprenticeship pathway which could be an alternative route to the legal profession and qualification as a solicitor. It is in discussion with the relevant regulatory body and sector skills council, Skills for Justice, to progress its proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the past, apprenticeships were restricted to only some trades, and some parts of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now we are introducing apprenticeships in all types of jobs, including a new route to the professions, to ensure everyone can reach their potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These new apprenticeships will help more young people to receive on-the-job training at top companies like BPP Law School, ensuring a vocational route to success in accounting, insurance, and the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director of BPP Professional Apprenticeships James Hammill said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are committed to improving social mobility and diversity in the work place by opening up some of the most prestigious professions and employers to school leavers as an alternative to the traditional route. Apprenticeships are an excellent way for employers to recruit talent early and design a structured training programme that incorporates technical learning as well as invaluable work based skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BPP Law School is based in eight UK cities: Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester and Swindon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Boosting skills and jobs on the south coast</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Following the Autumn Statement, Vince Cable visited Southampton to launch two schemes to improve skills and create sustainable employment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Cable was in Southampton to launch two key schemes to improve skills and create sustainable employment, following on from new investment launched in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/as2012_index.htm"&gt;Chancellor’s Autumn Statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He visited Eastleigh College to announce a new £550 million Further Education Capital Investment Fund to help improve college facilities across the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That investment  will be targeted towards colleges in the greatest need of help to improve facilities, improve efficiency and save money in the long term. Colleges will be able to apply for funding through the Skills Funding Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extra £310 million for the Regional Growth Fund to create and safeguard jobs was also announced in the Autumn Statement.  To date, £2.4 billion has been conditionally offered to businesses and intermediaries up and down the country – creating jobs and boosting the local economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The south coast has benefited from a number of different Regional Growth Fund projects and programmes. The Solent LEP has been awarded £2m from the Regional Growth Fund to roll out the second phase of the successful Bridging the Gap Funding programme to Southampton and the Isle of Wight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other beneficiaries of Regional Growth Fund awards for the area include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Southampton City Council has been awarded a further £5.3 million Regional Growth Fund in support of the ‘Platform for Prosperity’ project bringing the total to £10.9 million. The project entails the improvement and upgrade of the road infrastructure outside Eastern Docks and is expected to create or safeguard over 800 jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cobra Precision Engineering and Elite Care Homes are two of the first recipients of £100,000 of phase one of the Solent LEPs Bridging the Gap award. The grant will leverage close to £600,000 additional private investment and create and safeguard 12 jobs at the two firms. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Solent Future’s project is a £13m Regional Growth Fund money investment from Round 3. Part of the funding will be utilised to ensure a sustainable future for the Advanced Manufacturing skills in the Solent workforce. This will bring together leading businesses, colleges and Universities at a world-class training centre on the Solent Enterprise Zone. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Portsmouth Naval Base Property Trust in Portsmouth secured £1.23 million of Regional Growth Fund to support two projects within the Historic Dockyard at Portsmouth. 
£750,000 will be used to develop the Cell Block Enterprise project which will support enterprise skills development and provide access to early stage funding with mentoring managed by the University of Portsmouth. The project aims to create over 440 jobs in the supply chain. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£475,000 will contribute to the development of the International Boatbuilding Training College (IBTC) which combines heritage conservation with apprenticeships and other training to develop transferrable skills. The project has also had initial support from the Heritage Lottery Fund which could result in a final grant of £3.9 million grant to help support the development of heritage skills for the future. Both projects will have a ten year economic life cycle. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="links"&gt;LINKS&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Autumn Statement 2012</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has delivered his 2012 Autumn Statement to Parliament.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Autumn Statement is one of two major statements the Treasury has to give to parliament every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Statement provides an update on the Government’s plans for the economy based on the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. These forecasts are published alongside the Autumn Statement on 5 December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From today’s update of the government’s spending plans, the Department for Business has secured £2.4 billion of additional funding to support growth, with a focus on skills and science projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This money reinforces the government’s commitment to plan for medium and long term recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will aid the development of an industrial strategy to shape and rebalance our economy, in partnership with business. This will drive growth, create the jobs of the future and help us get ahead in the global race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="main-announcements-for-bis"&gt;Main announcements for BIS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An additional £600 million for science, research and innovation, which takes the total investment since the 2010 spending review to an additional £1.5 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extra £270 million to be spent on laboratories, classrooms and other facilities in our Further Education colleges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£1 billion confirmed for the business bank, which will address the long-term structural gap in lending to small businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extra £120 million invested in supply chains, to encourage companies to invest here in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Regional Growth Fund will also receive an additional £350 million, bringing the total available in 2012-13 to £2.75 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first stage of the government’s response to Lord Heseltine’s independent review on economic growth, ‘No Stone Unturned’.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra money for the Employer Ownership Pilot, taking it to £340 million overall and giving businesses funding so they can design and develop their own training programmes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased funding of £140 million for UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI) to help small and medium sized business export abroad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£1.5 billion to help our smallest companies to access growing markets overseas. For the first time UK Export Finance, the Government’s export credit agency, will be able to issue loans to overseas customers and buyers wanting to purchase goods from UK businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A package of measures to cut back red tape that business has told government stops them from growing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="science-and-innovation"&gt;Science and Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the Spending Review in 2010 the yearly £4.6 billion funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms and ring-fenced during the spending review period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra £600 million announced today will be invested in facilities for technological research and development and Research Council infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This amounts to an additional £1.5 billion of capital funding for science, research and innovation since the beginning of the Review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This investment will support the development of innovative technologies and strengthen the UK‘s competitive advantage in areas such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big data and energy efficient computing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advanced materials.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Energy storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details about how the £600 million will be spent will be published in due course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Science budget will continue to be protected and ring-fenced for the rest of the Spending Review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Richard Review of Apprenticeships</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Entrepreneur and educator Doug Richard publishes his independent report on the future of apprenticeships.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;27 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his independent report Doug Richard calls on the government calls to improve the quality of apprenticeships and make them more focused on the needs of employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His recommendations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redefining apprenticeships: They should be targeted only at those who are new to a job or role that requires sustained and substantial training. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focusing on the outcome of an apprenticeship - what the apprentice can do when they complete their training - and freeing up the process by which they get there. Trusted, independent assessment is key. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recognised industry standards should form the basis of every apprenticeship. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All apprentices should reach a good level in English and maths before they can complete their apprenticeship. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Government funding must create the right incentives for apprenticeship training. The purchasing power for investing in apprenticeship training should lie with the employer. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greater diversity and innovation in training - with employers and government safeguarding quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.schoolforstartups.co.uk/richard-review/richard-review-summary.pdf"&gt;Download the summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.schoolforstartups.co.uk/richard-review/richard-review-full.pdf"&gt;Download the full report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the launch of his review, Doug Richard said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No matter who I speak with, everyone agrees that apprenticeships are a good thing - but only when they are ‘true’ apprenticeships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With the myriad of learning experiences which are currently labelled as apprenticeships, we risk losing sight of the core features of what makes apprenticeships work so my conclusion is that we need to look again at what it means to be an apprentice and what it means to offer an apprenticeship as an employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Apprenticeships need to be high quality training with serious kudos and tangible value both to the apprentice and the employer. I want to hear about an 18 year old who looked at their options and turned down a place at Oxbridge to take up an apprenticeship if that is the right path for them. And I want to hear that their parents were thrilled.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need to make sure that apprenticeships are the success story they deserve to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has welcomed the report. Business Secretary Vince Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Doug Richard’s review echoes the Government’s current thinking on putting employers in the driving seat of our apprenticeship programme. This will be vital to ensure the skills of our workforce fit with employer needs.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“His recommendations will help us to build on the current successes of our apprenticeships programme and tailor a programme which is sustainable, high-quality and meets the changing needs of our economy in the decades to come”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>£400 million boost to England's colleges</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>£400 million will be spent at a number of English colleges to upgrade facilities and resources, with £110 million coming from the Government.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;21 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects at 56 English colleges range from the launch of a state-of-the-art civil engineering academy, to transforming classrooms into vocational workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the announcement at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.aoc.co.uk/"&gt;Association of Colleges (AoC)&lt;/a&gt; Conference, Business Secretary Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These projects will transform the learning environment for thousands of students across the country, providing them with state-of-the-art facilities and modern resources that will help them fulfil their potential.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Addressing gaps in skills is an important part of our industrial strategy. This initiative is another example of how Government is working in long-term partnership with industry to give them more confidence to invest, hire and grow.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of succesful bids include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South Essex College of Further and Higher Education raising almost £40 million which will be combined with nearly £3 million grant support to build a new town centre site. It will have facilities ranging from mechanical engineering workshops to student training kitchens.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new £4 million agriculture building at Bridgwater College in Somerset which will address the growing demand for specialist rural skills and develop closer links with the agriculture industry in the region.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new £7.7 million creative industries building at Kingston College.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£8.1 million on refurbishing the campus and building new arts facilities at Burton and South Derbyshire College. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government is investing £110 million, through the Skills Funding Agency, which is matched with £302 million investment from colleges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May this year all colleges were invited to apply for up to £3 million for individual projects, with an expectation that the facilities will be ready to use by September 2014. The resources are aimed at colleges that have not received significant funding in the recent past. &lt;/p&gt;

    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Vince Cable sets out how government will improve the status of FE colleges, provide funding to improve facilities and focus on apprenticeships and social mobility.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to begin, as I did this time last year, with a note of thanks. On that occasion, I took the opportunity to congratulate you for catering to the increasing numbers of adults taking basic skills courses - and, indeed, for the great strides you made in delivering apprenticeships. More on those in a moment.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start with what’s been the main story of the year - the London Games - where the contribution of our FE sector was considerable. More than 8,000 students from 60 colleges were trained through the “Bridging the Gap” programme, coordinated by North Hertfordshire College, with over 4,000 finding work in security and stewarding roles. In the host boroughs, Hackney Community College led the effort to prepare unemployed residents for similar job opportunities. And on the field of play, someone has worked out that if the FE college and university graduates in Team GB were to constitute a separate country, they would have come seventh in both the Olympic and Paralympic medal tables.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that I’m also very encouraged by further increases in adult participation - 15 per cent on Skills for Life courses in English, 20 per cent in maths. All told, provisional data for the 2011/12 academic year reveal over 3.1 million learners aged 19 or over in government-funded further education - including the almost 700,000 people who benefitted from a community learning course. Then we have strong apprenticeship numbers, with more than half a million apprenticeship starts in 2011/12.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These successes are testament to your efforts. I also realise that you are having to manage change, some of it difficult: Community Learning Trust pilots underway; the introduction of adult loans from the start of the 2013/14 academic year; the latest round of the employer ownership pilots for apprenticeships. I want to express my own appreciation to the AoC for the constructive comments we received on the 24+ loans scheme, which led us to introduce additional measures to help students on Access to HE courses and disadvantaged groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="perceptions"&gt;Perceptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever visiting FE colleges I am always struck by the energy and entrepreneurial sprint of those who lead and work in them. Yet the feeling has remained that people in this country, and some politicians, regard further education as the poor relation to higher education. It explains why ministers and college principals have bandied around awkward phrases such as “parity of esteem” - almost willing school leavers, mature students and the general public to change their minds.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are changing, though - and I believe it’s time to stop agonising about negative perceptions. In our popular culture today, the contestants on Masterchef or Great British Bake Off receive infinitely greater exposure than the teams on University Challenge. We rightly admire craft and skill as much as - if not more than - knowledge.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The educational landscape is changing. By the end of this Parliament, we aim to have transformed the status of apprenticeships in this country. My ambition is that by 2015 an 18-year-old leaving school and weighing up the choice of degree versus apprenticeship would do so without factoring in social stigma - seeing them as different but of equal value in terms of experience, job prospects, value for money and earnings potential.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make sure that skills provision in this country is of such quality that any lingering snobbery is removed from the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="improving-college-facilities"&gt;Improving college facilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of facilities in FE should match the aspiration of the sector. I am very aware of the of legacy problems from past underinvestment in the FE estate. As college principals know, we have just confirmed the recipients of the third tranche of renewal grants to 56 more colleges - with Government putting up £110 million in this round alongside over £300 million of investment from the colleges themselves. I regret that at present we are only able to fun half the bids - but there will be future rounds. This money will be put to creating specialist facilities and modernising existing ones - new laboratories at Stratford-Upon-Avon College; a new creative industries building at Kingston College; a new arts centre at Burton and South Derbyshire College.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This programme, supporting an injection of £1 billion into the FE estate, is producing learning environments in which our lecturers can deliver an excellent education to their students. Sprucing up campuses can give a lift to entire communities - not least through the jobs associated with the remodelling and building work. Over the past three years, we have ensured that all FE colleges in England have had the opportunity to apply for some degree of grant funding. Last year, 244 colleges across England were successful in securing Renewal Grant funding. And this year, a further 150 colleges received support, with 56 of them securing up to £3 million for important building projects. I am grateful for the active support and participation of the AoC throughout the process of setting criteria, assessing applications from colleges and allocating resources.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FE, then is a sector that is expanding. Looking ahead, I see three main tasks in particular. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="apprenticeships"&gt;Apprenticeships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there must be no let-up in the drive to increase and improve apprenticeships.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the coming year, we’ll be focusing on making sure that all apprenticeships offer substantial new learning, and that the qualifications apprentices take are stretching and valued by employers. Doug Richard’s forthcoming recommendations will be important here. We’re going to continue increasing the number of higher level apprenticeships, to degree level and beyond, especially in priority sectors like engineering, construction and digital And we’re going to broaden the input of employers in all aspects of apprenticeships - with a special effort to get more SMEs involved.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government is also doing more to practise what it preaches - like my own department, where around 30 members of staff, all aged over 25, have signed up for apprenticeships, half of which are at Level 4. In future, we want to expand the scheme to include profession-specific apprenticeships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="social-mobility"&gt;Social mobility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second task is improving social mobility. Here, much of the debate has concentrated on universities, which have increased overall participation of those from disadvantaged backgrounds, though not in the most selective institutions.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, to promote meaningful social mobility we must also improve the life chances of those who have already reached adulthood. The UK today has nearly 5 million people of working age with no qualifications.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re doing what we can - including through the all-age National Careers Service - to spread the message that education and training are worthwhile at any point in life. There is a wage return of around 6 per cent just from achieving basic literacy and numeracy. So it is vital that people know about second chances - including those leaving state institutions - a care home, a prison, the Army. Indeed, one of our policies I’m proudest of is a prisons programme in collaboration with a local FE college boosting maths and English skills, based on Army experience.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are committed to the continued funding of English and maths courses for adults without basic skills. We are now funding adults to get Maths and English GCSEs. These programmes are meat and drink for colleges - they always have been. It’s important that colleges are not only recognised for their role as agents of social mobility, but that you make yourselves heard in the wider debate.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for the people in our communities who provide personal learning, family learning and neighbourhood learning courses. The value of what you do cannot be adequately conveyed in bald numbers - because they do not measure improved mental health or self-esteem, nor the boost children get from having parents able to help them read in the evenings or discuss their schoolwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-better-deal-for-young-people"&gt;A better deal for young people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final challenge also falls within the parameters of social mobility, and it’s about filling a gap in provision for young people not in education or employment. Policy formulation remains at an early stage, but I want to give you sense of what we’re considering.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is this: the Government has a clear vision for 16- to 18-year-olds, where we are raising the participation age and increasing support for English and maths. But for young people over 18, the offer is much less clear. There’s generous educational support for some - despite fees higher education is still substantially subsidised - but, for others, financial support through the benefits system can actually prevent them from learning.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, we should be keeping this age group as far away from the benefits system as possible, unless there’s a really compelling need. For this group, then, we need a much simpler system, which supports and incentivises people to get the skills they need to secure sustainable employment, whether through HE, FE or an apprenticeship, or through more bespoke interventions to help them acquire the employability skills that too many companies tell me are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, let me conclude on an optimistic note.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also happened to be in Birmingham last week, attending the Skills Show at the NEC. For the thousands of visitors, it was a terrific event showcasing competitions in 50 different skills, offering people hands-on experience and providing expert careers advice. It showed that preparations for WorldSkills 2013 are well on track - and that we’re providing young people with the skills and motivation to start a business of their own.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on my way here today, I stopped in at Dudley College to formally open their new vocational and sixth form centres. It was great to see how their plans for a learning quarter in the town centre are developing - and Dudley has just been awarded £2 million through the Enhanced Renewal Grants scheme to build specialist facilities to teach advanced manufacturing and engineering.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the FE and skills sector is in good hands and in good shape. I’m not blind to areas where we need to raise our game - declining take up of vocational qualifications is a concern, for example. Nevertheless, I’m confident that we’re doing the right things to achieve a bright future for FE - hacking away at bureaucracy, promoting our expertise abroad, treating education as a fundamental strand of the Government’s evolving industrial strategy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your efforts, and for your support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Association of Colleges annual conference 2012</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Matthew Hancock talks about the important role further education has in the UK's education system and how the government will raise the standing of FE.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, in this hall, the Prime Minister gave a speech about the need for Britain to compete in the global race.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He talked about how every one needs to reach their personal best. And how we must not leave anyone behind. He reminded us that our young people must be equipped to compete. Not just with our European neighbours, but with ambitious, innovative, and determined countries all over the world.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very specific challenge for everyone in this room. And it is that challenge that I want to talk about today.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over these past months, I have been hugely impressed by the go-getting and dynamic leadership of the best FE and sixth- form Colleges. I know that you are among the most innovative and responsive of any delivery arm of Government. I know that in this room there is the capacity to do so much more.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a very clear view about what my main role has to be as Minister of Skills. It is not to complain or be a constantly niggling critic. Instead, I want to be the unequivocal champion of Further Education.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m quite unusual in politics.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my school didn’t offer the A levels I wanted, I went along to West Cheshire College instead. You were there for me when I needed you. So I will celebrate, eulogise, proclaim and publicise the triumphs in Colleges every day across our land, not just because it is my job to do so, but because I know the value of what you do from my own personal experience.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t also tell it straight when I think things need to change.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I don’t want any change for change’s sake. But I know you sense a deep unfairness. You feel it in your hearts. I feel it too. It’s a sense of injustice that you deserve a better press, deserve the same recognition as schools and universities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well let me say this - I passionately believe that can happen.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reason set in stone why technical education should not be seen as on a par with or even more virtuous than university, like it is in Holland or Germany.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also believe this: there is only one way to make that happen. The route to recognition is for every college to be as good as the most outstanding college is today. It will come only when teaching in FE is uniformly high quality. Only when every college is as enterprising as the Gazelle group. When every college reaches for the stars.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outstanding education is the route to outstanding acclaim. I want to see every college an outstanding college. I want to see all teaching as inspiring as the best. I will work with you, support you, stand up for you, and yes, challenge you in that goal. And together we can get there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the public at large, the most trusted sign of excellence in education is a positive Ofsted report. School inspection has existed in England since the year Queen Victoria came to the throne. And I am at one with Sir Michael Wilshaw when he reminds us that “Satisfactory is not satisfactory as it’s not good”.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ofsted is challenging. I know that. It’s meant to be. But the response must surely be: to raise standards. To improve teaching. To perspire. To aspire. To inspire. And I am at your side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen for myself what our best Colleges can achieve: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working with engineers in Sheffield to train world class nuclear technicians &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing inspiring Peter Jones Enterprise Academies &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;joining employers and universities to sponsor new innovative Studio Schools, UTCs, and Academies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have seen for myself at the Skills Show here in Birmingham the amazing talent on display, honed and thriving through competition.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I see excellence I want to spread it. When I see innovation, I want to learn from it. When I see barriers to progress, I want to break them down.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, under reforms pioneered by my brilliant predecessor, you have taken hold of the freedoms and flexibilities you now have. From next year, a reformed funding system will, I hope, have given you yet more flexibility in how to provide outstanding education.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we all know there is more to do. So I want to outline plans in four priority areas where i see the need for further reform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apprenticeships &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;traineeships &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;qualifications &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;standards. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me briefly take each in turn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="apprenticeships"&gt;Apprenticeships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, apprenticeships.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, over a million Apprenticeships have been started, half a million of them in the last year. And while this increase in quantity is very welcome, we must ensure they are higher quality, more rigorous, and focused on what employers need. I hope that employers come forward with innovative proposals for higher quality Apprenticeships in the second round of the Employer Ownership Pilot we launched yesterday. And Doug Richard will before Christmas say how we can go further, in a report I hope we can embrace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="traineeships"&gt;Traineeships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as we raise the standard of Apprenticeships, that will leave a gap. Around the country I have been impressed by the work of many Colleges to give young people the skills they need to get and hold down a job, with Work Pairings, and joint ventures with the Youth Contract and JobCentrePlus. But we must do more.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we will bring forward a new traineeship, combining a rigorous core of work preparation, work experience, Maths, and english, with a great deal of flexibility around everything else. I want this to support the best of what’s available, help raise the participation age, and give a clear sense of progression into an Apprenticeship.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside Traineeships, we must also improve the way our skills system and our benefits system interact. How can we justify a system in which we pay people, so long as they don’t train, rather than support people so long as they do? It’s bad for the economy, it’s unfair on young people, and it has got to stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="qualifications"&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, high quality education needs stretching and valuable qualifications.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The QCF is here to stay as an organising framework post-19, but we must be more rigorous about what’s on it, and about what we in Government are prepared to spend scarce resources on. For vocational education to be valued and held in high esteem we must be uncompromising about the value added of vocational education.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are publishing a revised list of approved vocational qualifications for 14-16 year olds, covering courses taught from next September.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also supporting the work of the Royal Academy of Engineers on new engineering qualifications that will both fit the new system and be stretching and rigorous. I’d like to see more august, employer-led bodies like the Royal Academy step up and design the qualifications employers need. And as you know, as well as reforming qualifications at 16, are we are working on plans for colleges directly recruiting pupils aged 14 and 15 to be directly funded.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever the age of the learner, I share with Alison Wolf the view that we must encourage the use of the most rigorous and valuable vocational qualifications. And I also share her view that far too little genuinely occupational education takes place among 16-18 year olds.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that the route for academic kids is straightforward. But those who choose not to take the academic route too often are encouraged into a general applied qualification, instead of properly considering the value of an Apprenticeship or a rigorous occupational qualification.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the coming weeks we will publish a consultation on how to identify the highest value vocational qualifications for 16 to 18 year olds, just as we have done for 14-16 year olds.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In it we will also consider what more we can do to encourage the take up of Apprenticeships and occupational - as opposed to general applied - qualifications. And of course we must consider what this means for adult qualifications too.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For vocational qualifications to be seen to be stretching and strong, they must be stretching and strong, and that’s what I hope to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="standards"&gt;Standards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, standards.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already set out proposals for a guild, led by you, to build up inspirational teaching and a stronger sense of professionalism and pride.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am setting out plans for high quality colleges to achieve a Chartered Status for Colleges.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course raising standards means tackling poor provision too. We need to be firmer in tackling educational and financial failure, and turning underperforming colleges around.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so students and employers alike can see performance for themselves, I can confirm that, from this year, we will introduce common standards and measures of performance between schools and colleges. Both will be expected to meet minimum standards.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A levels and vocational qualifications are different, so they will be judged separately from each other. But each will be judged in the same way for all institutions. We said we’d introduce a level playing field, and we will.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is one area where Britain should lead the world, but where sinfully we have allowed ourselves to fall behind. Here in these islands, we invented the English language that now dominates the globe. It is the global language: of trade, of culture, of diplomacy, and of the arts. And our history is littered with many of the advances in mathematics too.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet too many of our young people cannot read or write, or add up properly. This is a scandal and it must change.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are reforming schools, and exams at 16, to make this happen. That great revolution will take a generation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we don’t have a generation. And it often falls to you to pick up the pieces.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to show the value we attach to English and Maths, and to make sure you’ve got the resources to deliver, today I’m announcing we are doubling the amount we pay for adult English and Maths functional skills, and for English and Maths within an Apprenticeship. English and Maths are the foundation of learning and we must succeed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four priorities: traineeship, apprenticeships, standards, and qualification reform, they are all aimed four-square at raising the value, the esteem, and the regard of further education and skills.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising only the best vocational qualifications. Increasing support for English and Maths. Stronger Apprenticeships. And new traineeships to help young people into a job.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will do what it takes so every one can play their part.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, I am a young man, and honoured to be your Minister. And while this job is hard, it is hugely motivating too. For I am passionate about giving everyone in our country the best possible start. I am passionate about what you do for your students every single day.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have not been dealt an easy hand of plenty. And I can’t pretend the road ahead is not tough.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know that the innovation, dedication, and inspiration in this room can get us to our goal. And along that road, I am at your side, every step of the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK Science gets a cash injection</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>In a speech at the Royal Society today, The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced two major new investments in science.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;9 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/speech_chx_091112.htm"&gt;his speech&lt;/a&gt;, the Chancellor announced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;An extra £60 million to Europe’s space programme&lt;/strong&gt;, bringing the total UK investment in the programme to £240 million per year. This new funding will secure the future of the European Space Agency (ESA) facility in Oxfordshire, including transferring ESA’s telecoms satellite headquarters to the UK and creating over 100 new high-tech jobs. &lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Research in synthetic biology will receive a £20 million boost&lt;/strong&gt;. That funding will support new research projects at the Universities of Manchester, Warwick, Nottingham, Glasgow and Exeter and the John Innes Centre in Norwich. These projects aim to help address major global challenges such as producing low-carbon fuel, reducing the cost of industrial raw materials and producing new pharmaceuticals. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minister for Universities and Science, David Willetts welcomed both announcements, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Synthetic biology could provide solutions to the global challenges we face and offers significant growth opportunities in a range of important sectors from health to energy. However the commercialisation of basic science is largely untapped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This investment is part of the Government’s commitment to making the UK a world leader in the research and application of synthetic biology. It will help to ensure that academics and industry can realise its full potential.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking specifically of the UK investment in the European Space Agency, he said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This increase will bring the UK’s total investment in the European Space Agency to an average of £240 million per year over the next five years. This will allow the UK to play a leading role in the next phase of European space collaboration. It will drive growth, create extra skilled jobs and help the UK to realise its ambition to have a £30 billion space industry by 2030.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Response to Select Committee report on apprenticeships</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Government responds to latest BIS Select Committee report on apprenticeships.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;6 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Business, Innovation and Skills Committee has today published a report on the Government’s Apprenticeships programme.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Apprenticeships are vital for equipping people with the skills they need to prosper, and the nation with the workforce we need to compete in the global race. Over a million people have started an apprenticeship since 2010, right across the economy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The report rightly celebrates the sharp rise in the number of apprenticeships, and steps taken to improve their quality, but there is more to do.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So I welcome this timely and thorough investigation into apprenticeships, and will consider carefully its suggestions to help make the programme even more successful.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have asked entrepreneur &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/further-education-skills/apprenticeships/richard-review"&gt;Doug Richard to report later this year &lt;/a&gt;on what more we must do to ensure the apprenticeship programme delivers the rigorous, high-quality service we all want to see.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;May I begin by saying what a pleasure it is to be invited give the Sir John Cass Foundation lecture here at the Cass Business School this evening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just ten years, the school has established a global reputation for the quality of its teaching and research. Earlier this month, the Economist ranked the full-time MBA programme the third best in the UK and ninth best in Europe. It is an outstanding achievement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject I have chosen to talk on is social mobility. Nick Clegg has recognised the importance of this debate and has given shape and substance to what was once a worthy yet amorphous concept. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now everyone wants a piece of this fashionable mantra which increasingly litters political speeches from all parties. Few people would actually disagree with it, but every effort needs to be made to ensure that these laudable aims continue to be rooted in the concrete reality of homes, jobs, pay, promotion and pensions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might ask why I choose this subject. It is a central declared objective of the Coalition and also one that is a focus of attention in some of the institutions for which I have ultimate responsibility: universities and FE colleges in particular. Tomorrow Alan Milburn, the former Labour Minister, will publish a report on Higher Education and social mobility. And, to be frank I’m keen to outline some of the measures my department is taking to give a tangible sense of what we are doing to improve social mobility - especially in adulthood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it helps to be concrete and personal. I suppose I am a walking example of social mobility, since my parents both left school at 15 to work in factories and I was the first person in my family to go to university. But for my father who was ambitious, energetic and passionate about self improvement, social mobility meant something different: the progression from terrace house to semi detached to detached; the leap from working with his hands to teaching other people how to work with their hands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And amidst all that, real passion was generated not by the big shifts in class but by the small increments of status: whether the neighbour next door had a bigger car or the embarrassment of having a provincial accent amongst social superiors. You may think I am being frivolous or even disrespectful but I sense that for millions of our fellow citizens social mobility is best understood in terms of small changes in everyday life rather than the bigger picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, social mobility is a two way street. We want everyone to move up; and no one to move down. But in the real world not everyone can be a star. Much of life is a zero sum game. Failure can often be the corollary of success. Social mobility is often embodied in the comprehensive school pupil who reaches Oxbridge, but what about the public school drop out who finishes up in lowly menial job. That is also social mobility. But this is surely what meritocracy is all about - success through hard work, not through birth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-is-social-mobility"&gt;What is social mobility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two key distinctions that shape the present Government’s approach to improving social mobility, and which were first set out in the Social Mobility Strategy published by the Deputy Prime Minister in April 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is the distinction between intergenerational mobility: the degree to which an individual’s social class is determined by that of their parents. And intra-generational mobility - the extent to which individuals are able to progress during their lives, irrespective of where they started out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if children are to improve their position relative to their parents, they must have real opportunities to climb the ladder during their own working lives. So the two forms of mobility - both inter and intra-generational -reinforce each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second distinction is between relative and absolute mobility. Relative social mobility assesses the comparative chances of people with different backgrounds ending up in particular social or income groups. Absolute social mobility looks at the extent to which people are able to do better than their parents. The latter is, of course, important - but progress may simply reflect economic growth and technological change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s emphasis is on relative social mobility. It wants individuals to have the same chance for progressing professionally or reaching a higher income bracket, regardless of their social class or background. In other words it is about equality of opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="evidence"&gt;Evidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach to these issues needs to be evidence based. Social mobility is a particularly difficult area, which demands high quality longitudinal research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this year we have launched a new birth cohort study, which will investigate the interplay of pre-natal, genetic and environmental factors affecting development. It will be a valuable addition to the five post-war studies that have provided the evidence base to date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current evidence on social mobility is complex and sometimes contradictory. But the broad picture is quite clear - today we have relatively low levels of social mobility, both by international standards, and compared with the earlier ‘baby boomer’ generation born in the immediate post-war period. There is a separate argument about inequality of income and wealth, where Britain’s position appears to have deteriorated in recent decades but that is a big topic for another occasion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rates of social mobility appear to have deteriorated over time: the evidence suggests that the influence of parental income on that of their children increased for those born in 1970 compared to those born in 1958. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is clear that an individual’s chances of reaching the top are heavily influenced by where they start off. Men from high income backgrounds are around three and a half times more likely than those from low income backgrounds to have high income as adults. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men and women with parents in professional and managerial occupations are twice as likely as those with parents in semi and unskilled occupations to end up in professional and managerial occupations themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This disparity begins in the early years and continues throughout childhood and into adulthood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 25% of children from poor backgrounds fail to meet the expected attainment level at the end of primary school, compared with 3% from the most affluent backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in school, children from more advantaged backgrounds are almost twice as likely to get good GCSEs in English and maths by the age of 16 as children eligible for free school meals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost one in five children receives free school meals, yet this group accounts for fewer than one in a hundred students at Oxford and Cambridge. Indeed those who qualify for free school meals aged 15 are 100 times less likely to attend Oxbridge than their peers educated privately [2000:1 against versus 20:1 against]. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These advantages are cemented in adulthood. Around 7% attend independent schools but they account for more than half of those at the pinnacle of their professions - including 70% of high court judges, 54% of top journalists and 54% of the CEOs of FTSE 100 companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="role-of-government"&gt;Role of government&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s clear from this evidence is that tackling such a complex issue needs an integrated approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some argue that early years intervention is the answer to a lack of social mobility. It is certainly important. A large socio-economic gap in cognitive skills has already opened up among children by the age of three 3. But such gaps increase over time. The Government has published a social mobility strategy and have implemented a number of policies which aim to improve social mobility in this area - 15 hours a week of free childcare for up to 40% of the most disadvantaged two year olds and providing additional funding at school for 1.8 million children in primary and secondary school through the Pupil Premium. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the fact that earlier interventions have the potential to be highly effective does not preclude the need for later investment. Indeed, a recent update of government research showed that adult learning had significant positive effects on mental health and wellbeing - in self-confidence, life satisfaction and the risks of depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, another forthcoming BIS report focusing on older learners has found that learning those aged 50-69, particularly unaccredited community learning, actually improves wellbeing and can also offset a natural decline as people get older. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later interventions can also improve the chances of future generations. There is a strong body of empirical evidence suggesting that skills are passed on across generations, which suggests that public investments in the early years are often about substituting for poor parenting skills. Therefore, to invest in parents to improve their skills is to invest in the formative years of a child’s life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And intervention in the early years needs to be followed up with ongoing programmes. Even an effective pre-school programme will need to be supplemented by further investment if long-term gains are to be secured. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I see my Department, for example, as having a central role to play in supporting adults with that all-important second chance to succeed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason I will look at the various post school policies for further education training - which my Department leads on - in order to assess their contribution to social mobility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="higher-education"&gt;Higher Education&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the political focus has been on universities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real progress has been made in widening participation. In the most disadvantaged areas, increases in university participation among young people have been greater in proportional terms than for their counterparts living in more affluent areas. While the focus has often been on the achievements of the traditional universities in the world’s top 100 - and I certainly celebrate their success - there has been less attention paid to some of the newer universities which have widened participation, amongst adults as well as young people. In particular the Open University has been a big positive influence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it remains the case that the most advantaged 20% of young people are seven times more likely to go to university than the least advantaged 40%. The progress made has also masked a position where institutions and courses that offer the greatest lifetime benefits to their graduates still fail to reflect the wider social mix of the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent HEFCE analysis has confirmed that success in widening participation to the sector as a whole has not been matched by the most selective institutions. Participation rates among the most disadvantaged 40 per cent of young people may be up overall when compared to the mid-1990s, but their representation at the top third of selective universities has remained almost flat over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Milburn’s report on Higher Education, which will be published tomorrow, quotes statistics from the Sutton Trust showing that four private schools and one sixth form college had more pupils entering Oxbridge than 2000 of England’s lower-performing schools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the reasons why we have introduced a new framework which places responsibilities on universities to widen participation. Professor Les Ebdon is the new director of the Office for Fair Access and the organisation has been given additional resources to support as well as challenge institutions. There remains a lot of misunderstanding around this agenda, some of it deliberate. There is no question of quotas and no question of universities losing their independence in respect of admissions. It is about encouragement and incentives not coercion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OFFA has already agreed 150 access agreements for 2013/14. And universities committed to them plan to spend £672 million - up from just over £400 million in 2011/12 - on increasing and retaining the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also encouraging that, despite many prophesies to the contrary, applications from people from some of the most disadvantaged backgrounds have remained strong since the introduction this year of the reformed system of student finance. Independent analysis by UCAS shows the application rate for people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds is holding up, with only a slight drop of 0.2 of a percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many of the critics, young people have understood that the fees changes operate through a form of graduate tax, a contribution which reflects a graduates’ ability to pay, as opposed to the income of their parents. Indeed, the government expects to fund more students over the duration of this Parliament than ever before and we expect to see more graduates in this Parliament than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we still need more research and evidence on issues like respective attractiveness of scholarships and fee waivers and the support packages for part time and mature students in particular. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Milburn’s report on Higher Education was widely trailed in the weekend papers and addresses some of these issues. He argues that expenditure on access could be better targeted with a focus on outreach. He questions how effective fee waivers are, and where bursaries might make most impact. He also raises extending the pupil premium concept to Higher Education. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ideas will be an important input into the work of OFFA, HEFCE and the universities themselves. David Willetts and I wrote to HEFCE and OFFA in May, asking them to develop a shared strategy for promoting access which maximises the impact of all spending by Government, HEFCE and institutions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Milburn also urges universities to make more use of ‘contextual data’ rather than merely A level grades. I stress that it is not the role of Government to impose admissions criteria on universities, they are independent and will remain so. But the use of contextual data to identify candidates with the ability and potential to succeed on a particular course or at a particular institution is not a new phenomenon. The Government has made clear its support for the use of such data before, in both the social mobility strategy and the Higher Education White Paper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more employers can do to reflect the positive changes in the university sector. As a graduate, you can surpass all expectations at university but still fail to get a job with certain milk-round employers simply because you failed to get good A levels. The fact you defied all the odds and got a First is completely irrelevant to some if you didn’t achieve at least AAB at school. So the challenges of having been to a poor school can stay with you for life despite later successes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="apprenticeships"&gt;Apprenticeships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But too little attention has been paid to the 60% who don’t go to university. The Government has introduced the £1 billion Youth Contract to help young people get earning or learning and we are spearheading the drive to encourage more people to take up apprenticeships as a proven route for post school training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers have grown rapidly, nearly doubling from 239,900 Apprenticeships starts in 2008/09 to over 450,000 in 2010/11. Provisional figures for 2011/12, show continued progress, with 502,500 starts recorded. Within this, the number of 19-24 year old apprentices has grown by around two thirds between 2008/09 and 2010/11, provisional figures for 2011/12 show a continued increase and, while the number of under-19s was up over 30% by 2010/11 - the trend has slowed recently. Advanced and Higher Apprenticeships have risen rapidly, with provisional figures for 2011/12 showing continued growth, with 180,400 Advanced and 3,500 Higher Apprenticeship starts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong vocational education leads to better wages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those completing an Intermediate Apprenticeship earn, on average, up to £74,000 more over their lifetime than those with Level 1 or other Level 2 qualifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those with an Advanced Apprenticeship earn on average up to £117,000 more over their lifetime compared to individuals with Level 2 qualifications. These wage premiums are significantly larger than for other Level 3 qualifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these clear benefits, we must ensure that high quality apprenticeships are widely accessible. There are people who have the potential to benefit from apprenticeships, but who lack the skills required - whether that’s the appropriate English and maths skills or the ability to manage the disciplines and routines of the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we have introduced a new &lt;code&gt;Access to Apprenticeships&lt;/code&gt; programme for young people aged 16-24 who are not in education, employment or training, or who face forms of other disadvantage. Participants will undertake a programme of work and training with the aim of getting a paid job with an employer as quickly as possible to continue and complete apprenticeship training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="offering-a-second-chance"&gt;Offering a second chance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues of ladders into apprenticeships raises a wider question of ladders of opportunity for those who are out of work, or in a low-skilled job and lacking qualifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even today, the UK has nearly 5m people of working age with no qualifications. In England there are 8.1m adults who lack functional numeracy, and 5.1m who lack functional literacy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young people who lack qualifications are more likely to be unemployed and to be unemployed for longer. Around 45% of long term-unemployed 18-24 year olds have skills below level 2, compared with 20% of the total 18-24 population. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And disadvantage persists even among people in work - employers are far less likely to train low-skilled staff, which in turn limits their ability to rise through the ranks. Evidence also shows that low-skilled workers are the least likely to change jobs, even though wage increases are secured by moving on and up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the low skilled are also most likely to face significant obstacles to learning. Cost, including the opportunity cost of not working - wages foregone - is an obvious barrier to those on low incomes especially for those with family responsibilities. In addition, the National Adult Learner Survey showed that those with lower qualifications were less likely to know about the learning opportunities available to them, and less likely to know where to go for advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So government has a role in sparking the interest in training that means individuals are ready to grasp second chances. And that includes people leaving state institutions - a care home, a prison, or even the Army. One of the recent policy interventions I am proudest of is an intensive programme we are trialling in prisons to boost maths and English skills and, hence, improve employability - based on Army experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we had to make a lot of difficult decisions in the Spending Review, in spite of this, we protected the budget for community learning. Community learning involves anything from using the internet or learning to make music, to supporting children better by understanding how maths is taught in primary schools. It is often the first step towards formal training and the acquisition of qualifications - and once it begins, many individuals will go on to gain higher level skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, a programme that some have derided in the past as being focused on basket weaving courses for middle class housewives - I recall some potentially condescending ministerial comments when I raised this issue in opposition - can now demonstrate real opportunities for self improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends are not all positive, I do recognise there has been some falling off in demand for adult further and higher education in the last year and I am eager to understand further the factors involved. The picture varies: adult apprenticeships for example are up but other vocational education is down. Understanding of the new university funding arrangements is seemingly greater within schools than amongst adults. We clearly have much to do to raise awareness. The cost of many courses has increased - sometimes sharply - but part timers in HE now have access to the student loan scheme; and there are no more upfront fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We clearly need to spread the message that time invested in education and training is worthwhile no matter what stage the learner is at in their working life. Research published by my Department demonstrates wage and employment benefits from a range of qualifications when taken in adulthood. For example, there is a wage return of around 6-7% to L1 English and maths, in other words basic literacy and numeracy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering this second chance to adults also yields real benefits for their children. Ofsted research found that adults engaged in learning became more involved in school life, and improved their parenting skills, helping them communicate with their children and better manage their behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And children whose mothers have GCSE-equivalent qualifications or above score 16 percentiles higher at Key Stage 4 than children whose mothers have no educational qualifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons we are committed to the continued funding of English and maths courses for adults who lack these basic skills. Over 1.3m people took English or maths Skills for Life courses to improve their basic skills during the 2010/11 academic year. And we are now funding adults to get a Maths and English GCSE, providing a second chance for those who missed out first time around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any evidence based approach to policy in the area of social mobility must by necessity be inhibited by the time it takes to assess results. We cannot and should not be dogmatic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me back to an earlier point: the evidence we have, though incomplete, suggests that narrow interventions based on the early years of children’s lives will not, by themselves, clear away the barriers to social mobility significantly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To promote social mobility we must also improve the life chances of those who have already reached adulthood. We cannot support children without also giving parents a second chance. Let me go back to where I began with a personal anecdote. My father’s big breakthrough from crafts man to teacher of craftsmen occurred when he accessed government financed adult teacher training, when he was 30. And my mother’s escape from domestic drudgery and isolation occurred at adult education college when she was 40. Our family was fortunate to have these opportunities and I want the present generation to have the same chances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we are focusing our efforts on providing fair access to high-quality education and training across the age range. Because, as the Cass Business School illustrates so vividly, education is the best way of opening the door to professional success and personal fulfilment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>Government and business boost UK workforce with £165 million co-investment in skills.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;11 Sep 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siemens, Sembcorp and Nissan are some of the 34 businesses that have successfully bid to design the vocational training programmes they need to grow and create tens of thousands of opportunities for young people   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable made the announcement as part of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Sep/cable-outlines-vision-for-future-british-industry"&gt;Government’s Industrial Strategy in his speech at Imperial College&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are the first round of winners taking part in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/further-education-skills/employers/employer-ownership-pilot"&gt;Employer Ownership Pilot (EOP). &lt;/a&gt;They will receive a share of £67 million and will more than match the funding by investing a combined total of £98 million.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included within the round one projects are radical proposals from Siemens, Arla Foods UK and BAE Systems to train employees not just within their own company but also within their supply chains.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as supporting businesses and giving them the confidence to invest and grow, the Employer Ownership Pilot will create life changing opportunities for thousands of young people. The first round of co-investment is expected to generate: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11,000 apprenticeships, including 4400 for 16-18 year olds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;27,000 full time equivalent non-apprenticeship vocational training opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;49,000 other learning or training opportunities, including work experience and work placements. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Britain must have the skills Britain’s employers need.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By giving businesses the chance to shape and set their own training agenda, we’re giving them the power to enrich their workforce with the skills needed for their future success.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Employer Ownership Pilot will give businesses access to up to a total of £250 million over two years, with more successful bidders being announced in October, and a further bidding round to be launched in the autumn. &lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Following today's publication of the Holt Review, government will bring in new measures to aid businesses in recruiting apprentices.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;29 Aug 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeweller and social entrepreneur Jason Holt was commissioned in February this year to review ways to make apprenticeships simpler and more accessible for small and medium businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/further-education-skills/docs/m/12-891-making-apprenticeships-more-accessible-to-smes-holt-review.pdf"&gt;Read Jason Holt’s full report. (PDF, 458 Kb) &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/blog/2012/08/29/apprenticeships-an-excellent-way-to-turbo-charge-your-business/"&gt;The BIS Blog: Apprenticeships an excellent way to turbo-charge your business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His research pointed to a lack of awareness about the benefits of taking apprentices on, and how to recruit and train them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On publication of his report, Mr Holt said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whilst apprenticeships offer undoubted growth opportunities for businesses, not enough SMEs are taking advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is because they have an outdated view of apprenticeships, are often in the dark, and frequently do not receive the specific training provision their apprentices need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My recommendations are intended to address these issues with government, employers and providers all playing a part.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/Employers/The-Benefits.aspx"&gt;Find out more about the business benefits of hiring an apprentice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister John Hayes today welcomes the findings, and outlines new measures to improve apprenticeships for SMEs. These include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving communication about schemes through groups who advise small and medium employers, including lawyers and accountants. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better information for businesses on getting the right type of training for their apprentices. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New standards for training providers in order to improve their performance. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improving the Apprenticeship Grant for Employers, making it simpler and more accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="revisions-to-the-apprenticeship-grant-for-employers-age"&gt;Revisions to the Apprenticeship Grant for Employers (AGE)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme provides up to 40,000 grants of £1500 to encourage and support employers taking on a young apprentice aged 16 to 24. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes to the £1,500 Grant will include delivering it in a single payment, rather than the current two. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers will be able to claim grants for up to 10 apprentices, and the scheme will be opened to employers who have not hired an apprentice in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Grant will be made available to businesses with up to 1,000 employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister John Hayes announced the government’s response on a visit to Lincoln’s PK Automotive, which is taking on its first apprentices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business owner Paul Killingsworth said: “My apprentices, along with my trained technicians, are an investment in the development and future of my business.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doug Richard to lead independent apprenticeships review</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Entrepreneur Doug Richard has been appointed to undertake a review of apprenticeships in England to ensure that the future needs of the economy are effectively met.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;11 Jun 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneur, former Dragon’s Den Investor and founder of School for Startups, Doug Richard, is to lead an independent review into the future of apprenticeships in England.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Richard Review of Apprenticeships, commissioned by BIS and the Department for Education, will look at how to build upon the record success of apprenticeships in recent years. Mr Richard will focus on a number of key questions: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should the core components of an apprenticeship be - to meet the needs of employers (large and small), individuals, and the wider economy? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who should apprenticeships be for - which types of learners and employers can benefit most from apprenticeships? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are there elements of apprenticeships which should be simplified or stripped back? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are the qualifications which are undertaken as part of an apprenticeship sufficiently rigorous, and recognised and valued by employers? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How should delivery arrangements ensure all that apprenticeships provide significant new learning and acquisition of new skills, rather than the accreditation of existing ones? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are there opportunities to improve the impact and value for money of public investment in apprenticeships?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report is due to be published in Autumn 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Skills Minister unveils new investment in skills in key industries</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Skills Minister John Hayes has announced funds over £2.4m from the Growth Innovation Fund (GIF) to the nuclear and creative and cultural sectors.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;6 Jun 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GIF was set up to help employers overcome barriers to growth within their sectors and industries. So far the government has committed over £15 million to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost innovation and productivity &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;enable industries to set new professional standards &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;support new or extended national skills academies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="support-for-nuclear-skills"&gt;Support for nuclear skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nuclear.nsacademy.co.uk/"&gt;National Skills Academy (NSA) for Nuclear Manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; will receive government investment of more than £920,000. This will enable the Academy expand its activities into nuclear manufacturing to help UK manufacturers take advantage of the opportunities offered by the new nuclear build programme. It will also collaborate with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.semta.org.uk/"&gt;Sector Skills Council for Science, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies (SEMTA)&lt;/a&gt; and the Sheffield-based &lt;a rel="external" href="http://namrc.co.uk/"&gt;Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre&lt;/a&gt; to create a focal point to boost companies’ capability to develop skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within its first three years the expansion aims to deliver a more skilled workforce, with an increase of 3,500 learners taking up programmes, including more than 500 apprenticeships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="support-for-creative-and-cultural-skills"&gt;Support for creative and cultural skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nsa-ccskills.co.uk/"&gt;National Skills Academy for Creative and Cultural&lt;/a&gt; will receive around £1.5 million. This will enable it to expand and open up opportunities for more than 1,200 new apprenticeships and craft training for young people across the jewellery, design and cultural heritage sectors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSA Creative and Cultural also plans to reach around 1.2 million young people through their careers information, advice and guidance material over the next 5 years. It will work with a number of leading organisations and employers, for example the Goldsmiths’ Company, Holts Academy and the British Jewellers’ Association. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister John Hayes said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is businesses themselves that are best-placed to identify the skills they need to drive growth. This investment is very good news for the UK nuclear and creative industries and will help them to overcome the skills gaps that stand in the way of them meeting their full potential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The new centre for excellence for nuclear manufacturing will increase the number of opportunities for technicians and skilled workers and ensure that UK firms can source the skills they need to grow their market share in an expanding market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The National Skills Academy for Creative and Cultural has already demonstrated its success in working with more than 200 employers in the theatre and live entertainment business. I am delighted that investment will allow them to increase opportunities in the design, cultural heritage and jewellery sectors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both nuclear manufacturing and for creative and cultural, government funding will be matched by business and delivered over three years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Celebrate Adult Learners Week 2012</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Adult Learners Week, which runs from 12-18 May 2012, celebrates learning and inspires thousands through events around the UK.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;14 May 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.alw.org.uk/about-alw"&gt;Adult Learners’ Week&lt;/a&gt; is now in progress. Led by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.niace.org.uk/"&gt;National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE&lt;/a&gt;), it is the UK’s largest independent festival of learning, inspiring thousands of people each year to discover how learning can change their lives.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further education and skills are critical in helping to build an internationally competitive skills base. Engaging individuals in learning is where it starts.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through thousands of events and award ceremonies, Adult Learners’ Week, which runs until Friday, celebrates learners and promotes the benefits of all kinds of learning - whether learning for your job or career, trying something you’ve always wanted to do, helping your children at school or discovering something different about the world around you. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New National Careers Service launched</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The new National Careers Service launched on 5th April 2012.  It will offer independent and impartial information and advice on learning and work.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Hayes also hosted a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/topstories/2012/Apr/Ask%20John%20Hayes%20-%20Tweet%20your%20skills%20and%20careers%20questions"&gt;Twitter chat at 10.30am this morning&lt;/a&gt;, answering questions on the new service. Follow the conversation using #askhayes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="national-careers-service"&gt;National Careers Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining face to face to face local advice with a new interactive website, the new &lt;a rel="external" href="https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx"&gt;National Careers Service&lt;/a&gt; will: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide information and advice for approximately 370,000 young people through the use of the helpline and website. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offer face to face advice to 700,000 adults each year in a range of locations in local communities. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide detailed sector by sector labour market information so people can discover which industries are growing in their area. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide tools such as a CV builder and a Skills Health Check on the website to help people identify their skills strengths and gaps. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow people to open a Lifelong Learning Account, which gives them clear information and advice on skills, careers and financial support in a single, personalised online space. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Hayes said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The National Careers Service, universally available to people at all stages of their careers, has the very best interactive tools on its website and the highest-quality advisers, committed to the noble cause of helping others fulfil their aspirations.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Making available the right advice at the right time and in the right places is to strike a blow for social mobility, social cohesion and social justice - a society that encourages people from wherever they start to journey to the destination of their dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model turned Chef, Lorraine Pascale is an Ambassador for the service. Speaking from the launch she said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After modelling, choosing my next career move was a big decision. I knew I wanted to find something that I was really passionate about, but I tried courses in hypnotherapy, auto repair and interior design before I found the thing that really makes me tick: cooking.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having independent careers advice can really help you find the thing you want to do. I’d encourage everyone to make the most of the National Careers Service to find out how to take their career forward, and realise their ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her view was echoed by Record Producer Pete Waterman. He said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know from my own experience that it’s never too late to learn a new skill.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I learnt to read and write much later in life than many people, but this opened up a whole new world for me.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s one of the reasons why I’m so passionate about helping people to get the skills they need to fulfil their ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Better standards for Apprenticeships</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Tougher standards introduced by Skills Minister to drive up quality.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister John Hayes has announced that Apprenticeships will last for a minimum of 12 months, guaranteeing improvements in training and workplace learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new standards will come into force for all age groups from August 2012, subject to consultation with providers and employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those aged 19 and over, apprenticeships will last between one to four years unless prior learning or attainment has been undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the new measures, Mr Hayes said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The momentum we have created by building the apprenticeship brand has brought about unprecedented success for the apprenticeship programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The majority of apprenticeships are the gold standard in vocational training. They boost individuals’ life chances and build the skills that drive growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They also provide a great return on public money. This has been independently recognised with the National Audit Office finding that apprenticeships generating £18 for the economy for every £1 spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we must be relentless in our drive to ensure all apprenticeships are as good as the best, to identify and root out any instances of poor quality provision, and to raise the bar on standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are taking strong and decisive action to tackle short duration so all apprentices receive high quality training and workplace learning setting them on the road to a long, rewarding career.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="grants-for-small-businesses-employing-their-first-apprentice"&gt;Grants for Small Businesses Employing Their First Apprentice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Monday 2 April small businesses (employing less than 250 employees) &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/News-Media/Latest-News/Article135.aspx"&gt;will be able to apply for a grant, up to a value of £1,500,&lt;/a&gt; when they recruit their first apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/"&gt;National Apprenticeship Service &lt;/a&gt;(NAS) is offering up to 40,000 Apprenticeship Grants to businesses who take on an apprentice aged 16 to 24 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those businesses interested in employing their first apprentice can contact one of the quality assured training providers or colleges approved to deliver Apprenticeship training by visiting the National Apprenticeship Service, or if they are ready to recruit, can call 08000 150 600 to speak to a NAS Apprenticeship Adviser.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Santander to launch an apprenticeship scheme that will see up to 50 people offered places at the bank. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the event, Skills Minister John Hayes said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that these banks are investing in apprenticeships which will help them secure the high-quality skills they need to create economic growth and provide new pathways to excellence for the brightest and best young people.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Creating a highly skilled workforce that can take on the best in the world means seeing apprenticeships as an access route to the professions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£6m Higher Apprenticeship Fund will deliver thousands more degree level places. &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;£1,500 apprenticeship incentive for small firms now available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marking &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/topstories/2012/Feb/apprenticeships-week-2012"&gt;National Apprenticeship Week&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister announced a new round of Government funding to help deliver the world class skills firms need to drive growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister also opened the bidding for the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukces.org.uk/ourwork/employer-ownership"&gt;new Employer Ownership pilot&lt;/a&gt;, inviting employers in England to apply to access up to £250m of public investment and secure more control over how skills training is designed and delivered. Detailed guidance and application forms for the pilot will be issued towards the end of February. Bidding will close on 26 April 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also announced that from this week, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/Employers/Steps-to-make-it-happen/Incentive.aspx"&gt;small firms will be offered an incentive of £1,500&lt;/a&gt; to hire their first apprentices aged 16-24. This is expected to support up to 40,000 new apprenticeships over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m delighted to underline our commitment to strengthen our economy by helping employers take on apprentices and ensure that the UK workforce has the skills that businesses need. Under this Government apprenticeship starts are increasing at a record rate, with improvements across the age range, in all sectors, throughout the country.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By making apprenticeships a gold standard option for ambitious young people, we are sending a message that technical excellence is as highly valued as academic prowess. And by focusing investment where it is most needed to deliver sustainable growth and offering real ownership of vocational training to employers, we are equipping businesses with the skills they need to rebalance our economy and distribute opportunity more widely.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister John Hayes said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Clarity of policy and certainty of purpose in Government has delivered a record number of apprenticeships and driven up standards at every level. We must now go further to create new pathways to excellence for the brightest and best young people and help employers to secure the high-quality skills they need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our mission is to put practical training on a level playing field with academic study, creating a highly skilled, creative workforce that can take on the best in the world.”   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apprenticeships Week 2012</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Vince Cable launches the biggest ever Apprenticeship Week.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week is on track to be the biggest &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/Home/Awards/Apprenticeship-Week-2012.aspx"&gt;Apprenticeship Week&lt;/a&gt; to date, with over 500 events across the country celebrating the achievements of learners and employers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow the conversation and events on Twitter using the hashtag &lt;a rel="external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23NAW2012"&gt;#NAW2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skillset (the sector skills council for the creative industries) in partnership with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/About-Us/National-Apprenticeship-Service.aspx"&gt;National Apprenticeships Service&lt;/a&gt; (NAS), and supported by the Government, have pledged to work with 300 businesses in industries such as fashion, media and design to deliver 500 apprenticeships. The first places are set to be offered in September 2012.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these businesses are small firms who from next week will be able to apply for an incentive payment of £1,500 to take on their first apprentice in 2012/13. This scheme was announced by the Government in &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/topstories/2011/Nov/apprenticeships-boost-for-firms"&gt;November last year. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am very proud of the fact that at a time of financial constraint this Government has prioritised investment in apprenticeships. This has led to the creation of record numbers of apprenticeships combined with tough new standards to drive up quality.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Apprenticeships are at the centre of the Government’s skills policy because we know that they work. Not only do they provide individuals with the skills they need for prosperous and rewarding careers, they also boost businesses’ profits and drive growth in the wider economy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m pleased that the creative industries recognise this and we support all the work they are doing to increase the number of apprenticeships in the sector, particularly in small businesses.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are providing extra help to enable small employers to hire their first apprentices. We will also continue to develop new advanced and higher-level apprenticeships to deliver the world-class skills individuals and firms need to get ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeship Week is supported by a huge range of organisations including: employers, apprentices, media, business and sector organisations, learning providers, colleges and schools.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of Apprenticeship Week reflects the dramatic rise in the number of businesses that are taking on apprentices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official statistics released last week show that there were 457,200 apprenticeships starts in 2010/11 - an increase of 63.5 per cent on 2009/10. &lt;/p&gt;
