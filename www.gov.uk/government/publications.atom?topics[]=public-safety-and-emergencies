    <title>Fire and rescue authorities in England: operational statistics bulletin for 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication and accompanying appendix data tables were released on Tuesday 25 September 2012 by the Department for Communities and Local Government. The publication focuses on personnel, health and safety and fire safety for the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="numbers-of-staff"&gt;Numbers of staff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 31 March 2012, the total number of fire and rescue authority staff (full-time equivalents) was 48,900: 4% fewer than at 31 March 2011. There were 28,200 whole-time firefighter full-time equivalents (down 3% on 2011) and 11,700 retained firefighter units of 24-hour cover (down 4% on 2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a gradual increase in the representation of women and minority ethnic staff in recent years. At 31 March 2012, 4.3% of firefighters were women compared with 1.7% in 2002. Minority ethnic staff accounted for 3.3% of firefighters compared with 1.5% in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="staff-leaving-fire-and-rescue-authorities"&gt;Staff leaving fire and rescue authorities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2011 to 2012 there were 4,200 staff who left fire and rescue authorities. The most common reason for leaving was normal retirement (800).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="health-and-safety"&gt;Health and safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 3,400 reported injuries to firefighters in 2011 to 2012. This is 45% fewer injuries than in 2001 to 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="community-fire-safety"&gt;Community fire safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;770,000 home fire safety checks were carried out by fire and rescue services and their partners in 2011 to 2012, 7% fewer than in 2010 to 2011. There were 118,000 home fire safety checks to households with a disabled person in 2011 to 2012, up from 87,000 in 2010 to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of home fire safety checks of households with an elderly person (over 65 years) was 272,000 in 2011 to 2012, slightly lower than the 278,000 undertaken in 2010 to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fire-safety-audits-of-buildings"&gt;Fire safety audits of buildings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire and rescue services carried out 82,000 audits of buildings in 2011 to 2012, 3% fewer than in 2010 to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire and rescue authorities are focusing their audit activities so that premises that are considered to represent the highest risks are more likely to be audited. The highest proportions of audits against number of known premises were care homes, hotels and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall proportion of premises found to be satisfactory in 2011 to 2012 was 59%, compared to 56% in 2010 to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This equality statement considers the impact of the proposed firefighters’ pension scheme design from April 2015. This assessment has been carried out in pursuance of the public sector equality duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equality statement is a living document and, given the need to ensure that the assessment is robust, the assessment process will continue beyond the publication of this statement. The Department for Communities and Local Government will continue to consider whether the firefighters’ pension scheme design might be adjusted, or any mitigating actions necessary, to ensure that due regard has been given to the public sector equality duty, prior to the introduction of legislation on the detailed scheme design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Fire statistics monitor: April 2011 to March 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on fires, casualties, false alarms and non-fire incidents attended by the fire and rescue services in England, produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government, were released on Wednesday 4 July under the auspices of the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics in this release are the latest available figures for England. They focus on the period of 1 April to 2011 to 31 March 2012. Key points of the latest data are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fatal-and-non-fatal-casualties"&gt;Fatal and non-fatal casualties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2011-12 there were 304 fire fatalities; 27 fewer than in 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accidental dwelling fires fatalities, which account for three fifths of all fire fatalities, were down by 26 from 213 in 2010-11 to 187 in 2011-12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were 4,277 non-fatal fire casualties (excluding first aid cases and where only a precautionary checks was recommended). This was 2 per cent lower than in 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="incidents"&gt;Incidents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In England, Fire and Rescue Services attended 223,000 fires, 2 per cent lower than in 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dwelling fires were 4 per cent lower at 35,000, and fires in other buildings were down by 2 per cent to 20,000. Road vehicle fires fell by 14 per cent to 24,000.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attendances at fire false alarms decreased by 9 per cent to 249,000. More than two thirds of these were due to apparatus, while 4 per cent were malicious false alarms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fire and Rescue Services attended 133,000 non-fire incidents in 2011-12, down 9 per cent from 2010-11. The most common categories of non-fire incidents were: road traffic collisions (21 per cent), effecting entry (11 per cent), lift releases (11 per cent), flooding (9 per cent) and medical incidents (9 per cent).&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Fire incidents response times: England 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication and accompanying data tables were released on Wednesday 4 July 2012 by the Department for Communities and Local Government. The publication focuses on trends in average response times at England level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics in this release are the latest figures available for England and relate to periods up to 31 March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="response-times"&gt;Response times&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2011-12, the average response time to fires in dwellings was 7.2 minutes (10 seconds shorter than in 2010-11) and 7.9 minutes to fires in other buildings (5 seconds shorter than in 2010-11).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average response times in 2011-12 were higher than in 2001-02 by around 22 per cent for dwelling fires and by around 29 per cent for fires in other buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="severity-of-fires"&gt;Severity of fires&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On average, improvements in fire safety and prevention have greatly outweighed the effect of longer average response times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12, there were 54 per cent fewer fire non-fatal casualties and 34 per cent fewer fire fatalities than in 2001-02.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12, the average area of damage in dwelling fires was 20 per cent lower than in 2001-02.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
