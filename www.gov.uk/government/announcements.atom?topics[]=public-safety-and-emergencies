    <title>Preferred bidder for the Fire Service College confirmed</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire minister said he was happy that the proposed sale of the college to Capita would achieve value for money for the public purse and secure the future of the college.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Lewis said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that we are making real progress in securing the future of such an important facility. It is vital for the development of the Fire Service College that we put it on a sound footing, giving the private sector a chance to provide innovation and investment that will guarantee the future of a world-class asset.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure best value for money for taxpayers and enable the college to continue in its role, a number of conditions will be imposed on the proposed sale. These include commitments that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the college be preserved as a national training centre for fire and rescue authorities&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it will continue to offer wider national resilience and emergency services training and exercises&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;government permission will be required if Capita wish to sell the incident ground&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Councillor Kay Hammond, Chair of the Local Government Association’s fire services management committee, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is good news that government has listened to the views of the sector about the future of the Fire Service College and that it now looks set to get the outside investment it so badly needs. The Local Government Association and fire authorities will be keen to work with the future owners to help them transform the college into a first-class training facility fit for firefighters in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Fire Officers’ Association President, Vij Randeniya, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Chief Fire Officers’ Association welcomes the news that Capita has been selected. It has been a long and intensive process and we are glad that there is now clarity for the Fire Service College. We look forward to working closely with Capita to ensure that the very best provision is available for UK fire and rescue services.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government now looks forward to holding constructive discussions with Capita to ensure that the transition from public to private sector is as smooth as possible and expects to complete the sale early in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fire Service College is a trading fund and executive agency of the department. Since becoming a trading fund in 1992, it has never been able to pay a dividend out of operating profits. The government’s response to Fire Futures on 12 April 2011 concluded that the college could achieve its full potential only if there was greater involvement from other sectors in its ownership, operation and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Future Options project considered 4 options for the future of the college:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the status quo: the college remains as a trading fund of the department &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a government owned contractor operated model: the assets remain under government ownership but management of the college is taken over by a private sector company under a long term contract, together with the staff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;disposal as a going concern: the college is sold to a private sector company who would continue to operate the college as a training centre&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;closure: the college’s activities cease, staff are made redundant and the site is sold for an alternative use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the 4 options showed disposal as a going concern to be the best option, and the only one which both removes from government ongoing financial risks of ownership of the college and preserves a national training college for the fire and rescue service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers announced on 22 March 2012 that the Fire Service College would be sold as a going concern to a private sector company to continue operating as a training centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sale process was launched on 10 April 2012 and the due diligence phase concluded in October with the receipt of final bids. Best and final offers were received in November. The aim is to complete the sale in early 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/65m-contract-to-refit-royal-navys-largest-warship-secures-hundreds-of-uk-jobs"/>
    <title>£65 million contract to refit HMS Ocean</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warship was moored on the Thames during the London 2012 Olympic Games and provided essential security support and a home for hundreds of military personnel responsible for venue security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her upgrade will be carried out at Devonport Royal Dockyard in Plymouth and will be the largest upkeep programme of its kind to be carried out at the docks in more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract has been awarded to UK maritime support specialists &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.babcockinternational.com/" title="Babcock"&gt;Babcock&lt;/a&gt;, securing 300 jobs in Devonport. More than 70 contractors are also set to be involved in the project, securing a further 300 jobs across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the refit, which is expected to last 15 months, upgrades and improvements will be made to the ship’s radar, gun, command system and living quarters. In addition, around 1,200 metres of new pipework will be laid and around 100,000 litres of paint will be applied to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Assault-Ships/HMS-Ocean" title="HMS Ocean"&gt;HMS Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology Philip Dunne said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;HMS Ocean plays a crucial role supporting operations as we saw during the Olympics and the Libya campaign and it is essential that we continue to invest in the upkeep of this formidable vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="HMS Ocean" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4937/DR120330014g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted that this contract will not only ensure that HMS Ocean remains a significant, highly-flexible and capable warship for years to come, but will also secure hundreds of jobs within the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vice Admiral Andrew Mathews, Chief of Materiel (Fleet) for the MOD’s Defence Equipment and Support organisation, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since entering service HMS Ocean has delivered comprehensive support to countless military operations as well as humanitarian and disaster relief missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This extensive refit programme is essential in ensuring that this magnificent ship is able to continue in her role supporting and protecting the UK’s interests across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to her Olympics duties, HMS Ocean played an integral role in the Libya campaign launching Apache helicopters from her deck to attack Libyan ground defences, the first time Apaches had been launched from a Royal Navy warship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Royal Marines storm former Cold War base</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a scenario based around a hostile occupying force, the Royal Marines from the Lead Commando Group (&lt;abbr title="Lead Commando Group"&gt;LCG&lt;/abbr&gt;) joined up with their Albanian counterparts to practise their training for contingent operations as part of Royal Navy exercise Cougar 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the cover of smoke grenades, the combined forces quickly pounced on the ‘enemy’ lurking in the old submarine base on Sazan Island, taking them by surprise and then fighting their way through a complex labyrinth of bunkers and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 16 hours the Anglo-Albanian forces chased the enemy down, pushing them back all the time as they exercised the skills being practiced under Cougar 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Ric Moat of Zulu Company, 45 Commando Royal Marines, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The size and scale of Sazan Island is impressive. It provides a unique training opportunity for amphibious forces. It is a stern test, it is realistic, and it is demanding training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Raiding from the sea is clearly a different challenge to our land operations in Afghanistan, but it is no less challenging to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the old Soviet submarine base, Sazan Island is home to a chemical and biological weapons plant and there are more than 100 buildings and 5.7 square kilometres of trenches and bunkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="British and Albanian forces taking part in Exercise Albanian Lion on Sazan Island" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1487/Royal_Marines_storm_former_Cold_War_base2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;British and Albanian forces taking part in Exercise Albanian Lion on Sazan Island [Picture: Petty Officer (Photographer) Sean Clee, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Richard Alston of 3 Commando Brigade said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The complexity of the exercise should not be underestimated. We have completed two consecutive night raids and have now pushed reconnaissance teams 110 miles [177km] inland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are currently conducting a non-combatant evacuation exercise with the British embassy staff as part of the exercise scenario and have achieved all this in three days and nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Response Force Task Group, the &lt;abbr title="Lead Commando Group"&gt;LCG&lt;/abbr&gt;, made up of 45 Commando and 3 Commando Brigade, are inserted by sea and Royal Navy warships into trouble spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These operations, such as Libya last year, require a rapid reaction force to quickly deploy in response to unexpected world events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cougar 12 involves more than 3,000 sailors, marines and airmen in addition to four Royal Navy warships and one Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship which provide the platforms to plan the operations and also protect the troops from the sea and air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having practiced their skills alongside French Marines and soldiers in Corsica in October, the &lt;abbr title="Lead Commando Group"&gt;LCG&lt;/abbr&gt; will complete Albanian Lion before heading back to the UK at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/asian-fire-service-association-afsa-conference"/>
    <title>Asian Fire Service Association (AFSA) Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to be invited to speak here today and to see so many others here to support you. I understand that this is the fifth AFSA national conference, and my predecessor Bob Neill has spoken at the last 2. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Bob, who has a deep understanding of the issues you face, as well as a great knowledge of the sector. I know that Bob, when he was Fire Minister, greatly valued the close and positive relationship he had with AFSA. I very much hope to be able to continue that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-afsa"&gt;The importance of AFSA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of groups such as AFSA cannot be underestimated. You provide a forum for people to come together to discuss key concerns, to support each other’s development, and provide an opportunity for challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in terms of challenge, AFSA continues to perform a vital role in terms of ensuring that equality, diversity and fairness are mainstreamed in the Fire and Rescue Service. Events such as this provide excellent opportunities for the exchange of ideas, and for lively debate. I know that a regional AFSA group has been set up here in the West Midlands, supporting professional development and progression, sharing learning experiences, building a solid network of mutual support for employees, and supporting charities and fundraising. All of this shows the excellent work that the association is doing both at the national and local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="promoting-equality-and-diversity"&gt;Promoting equality and diversity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that Sir Graham Meldrum, when he was Chief Fire Officer in the West Midlands and again as Chief Inspector of Her Majesty’s Fire Service Inspectorate did a great amount of work to promote equality and diversity in the service, and this excellent work has been carried on by Vij as Chief Fire Officer of the West Midlands, and in his presidency of the Chief Fire Officers Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would like to say, on a personal note, that I am deeply committed to advancing equality of opportunity to one and all, not only in the fire and rescue service, but also in the communities they live in and serve. I am also of the firm conviction that this is best driven locally. And I say this because I want each fire and rescue authority to be responsible for reaching out to minority groups, and ensuring that they recognise that the service is for them - not as an add on - but for them along with everyone else in the community. I want fire and rescue services to go out into their communities, find the right people, engage with them and draw them into the heart of the fire and rescue service family. I want the entire community to be so integrated into the fire and rescue service that we no longer have to think in terms of equality and diversity - it will just happen automatically. I know that this is at the core of what AFSA is working for, and you have my full support in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt, a lot is already happening, and I would like to highlight some of the work going on here in the West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service. They have Welcome to the West Midlands, an education programme for new migrants to promote safety, well being, community understanding and citizenship. This has been developed in consultation with migrants to meet the information gap which can occur when someone arrives in this country. The West Midlands also has active employee engagement through the local AFSA group, working with them to target under represented operational and support staff to develop essential skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my short time as Fire Minister I have been very impressed by the wide range of local initiatives such as these, which not only reach out to the under represented, but also to the vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Greater Manchester, the fire service is leading a community project with the Asian Development Association of Bury. This project, which provided employment opportunities for local people, has already seen the production of a fire safety video that can be heard in eight of Manchester’s most commonly used languages. It will be the main communication tool used in community education sessions, facilitated by fire and rescue service volunteers recruited by the association. There will also be a series of workshops for the &lt;abbr title="Black and minority ethnic"&gt;BME&lt;/abbr&gt; business community designed to raise awareness of how the fire and rescue service can help them meet their responsibilities under the Fire Safety Order. This project will be rolled out across all of Manchester’s ten metropolitan boroughs in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To engage young people from a community they have previously found hard to reach, and to respect religious beliefs, they have established a cadet scheme in Hyde for young women from the Bangladeshi community, and they are hoping to use this as a model to engage many ethnic communities in similar activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is being driven forward at the local level - not by central target or quotas, but by responding to the demands of their local communities. And to be able to respond to these, each fire and rescue service needs to make full use of the human resources at their disposal - and to do this equality and diversity has to be at the core of any organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to delivering the best service to the local community is to have a diverse, representative workforce, equipped to understand and meet the needs of those it serves and capable of delivering a first class service to everyone. This will also support the service’s aim to create a better understanding of its preventative role and of the support and advice it is able to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire service must ensure that every employee is valued; that there truly is equality of opportunity for all, and that the working culture is such that unfair discrimination, unacceptable behaviour, bullying and harassment are not tolerated. I strongly believe that the fire and rescue service has gone a long way to achieve this goal and together with partners like AFSA they can continue to work to create an even more open and inclusive service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fire-kills"&gt;Fire Kills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also like to take this opportunity to thank AFSA for your continued support of the Fire Kills campaign. The Fire Kills campaign has had a focus on &lt;abbr title="Black and minority ethnic"&gt;BME&lt;/abbr&gt; groups since 2005 - and for good reason. Research has shown that certain &lt;abbr title="Black and minority ethnic"&gt;BME&lt;/abbr&gt; communities are at a potentially greater risk from fire. Smoke alarm ownership amongst Asian communities is ten per cent lower than the national average.  Recent analysis of accidental dwelling fire victim profiles has suggested that Asian communities are potentially more vulnerable than African communities. This has led to our 2012 campaign focussing solely on the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities. With smoke alarm ownership levels lower in these communities the primary message will be on the importance of working smoke alarms. Two bursts of advertising will run - one which began this week, and another in March 2013. The new campaign will focus on blessings. As you know blessing of wellbeing, health and a long life are delivered on important occasions in these communities. The new campaign will encourage people to make their blessings count - ‘when you give a blessing, make it count: test your smoke alarm’. There will be radio advertising to demonstrate the fire consequences of not having a working smoke alarm, linking it back to a blessing that was given. I have no doubt that this campaign, targeted primarily at first generation Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, will be a powerful tool for you and all those in fire and rescue services seeking to reduce deaths and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="economic-position"&gt;Economic position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of this conference is ‘advancing equality during austerity’. I think that it is important to note that there are signs of improvement in the economy. Jobs are being created, manufacturing and exports have grown as a share of our economy, our trade with vibrant, emerging economies such as China and Brazil is improving, and the world is once again investing in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we face many challenges. The debts built up over many years will take time to work our way through, not helped by a decline in our competitiveness which was effectively masked by unsustainable borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the need to cut the national deficit, fire and rescue, as a frontline emergency service, has been given funding protection with reductions back-loaded to give more time for sensible savings to be made, and reductions applied to fire and rescue authorities have been less than those applied to local authorities in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been heartened to hear how many fire and rescue authorities have risen to the challenges that the spending review has posed. However, I know some of you have concerns that fire and rescue services may disproportionately reduce funding on equality and diversity activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this is not the case. But if you see this happening, then you must speak up. It is vital that fire and rescue services do not make decisions that will impact on their ability to deliver on their statutory duties as required under the Equality Act 2010, and transparency and accountability are at the heart of our approach towards local government generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing I would like to thank you once again for giving me this opportunity to speak to you today. I do hope that your organisation goes from strength to strength, and that you remain and important and influential voice in the British fire and rescue service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to extend my congratulations to all the award winners who will be honoured at this evening’s event, well done, keep up the good work and have a great night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>New fleet of RFA tankers named</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 37,000-tonne ships will come into service from 2016 to replace the RFA’s single-hulled tankers, and will maintain the Royal Navy’s dedicated bulk fuel replenishment at sea capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 200-metre long tankers will also be able to carry helicopters and will support Royal Navy warships deployed around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head of the RFA, Commodore Bill Walworth, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted that the MARS fleet tankers will be called the Tide Class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The original Tides were the first purpose-built fleet tankers to support aircraft carriers and were highly successful and popular ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The new Tides promise to be better still. A large number of people have worked hard to get us to this point, with the ships on contract and the first to be delivered into service in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tidespring, Tiderace, Tidesurge and Tideforce, which is a new name, will be superb ships that will reflect the successful past and a confident future for the RFA service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ships will be built by Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering to a design provided by UK company BMT Defence Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The new Tide Class Royal Fleet Auxiliary tankers will come into service from 2016 " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1659/New_fleet_of_RFA_tankers_named2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Tide Class Royal Fleet Auxiliary tankers will come into service from 2016 
[Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, UK companies will benefit from up to £150m of associated spending on key equipment, systems, design and support services, and on the customisation and trials package which will take place in the UK once the ships have been built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original Tide Class fleet tankers served in the RFA from 1954 until 1991, operating worldwide in support of numerous operations and exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed using the lessons of the Pacific Campaign in the Second World War, these versatile ships were the first purpose-designed replenishment tankers for the RFA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrying bulk fuels, oil and fresh water they replenished aircraft carriers and warships, both British and Allied, enabling task groups to remain at sea for extended periods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tidespring - the original Tidespring was awarded a battle honour in 1982&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiderace - after service in the Suez Crisis, the Tiderace was renamed the Tideflow to avoid confusion with another ship name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tidesurge - originally launched as RFA Tiderange in 1954, she spent many of her early years east of Suez and served until 1976&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tideforce - a new name in the RFA service.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>2012/11/01 - Air Power: Partnership in the 21st Century</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;101 years ago today, on the first of November 1911, an Italian pilot threw four hand-held bombs out of a plane, from all of 600 feet, on Ottoman positions in what is now part of modern day Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although no-one was reported killed, and the only Ottoman response was, I’m told, a complaint of ungentlemanly conduct, this is generally regarded as the first bombing mission undertaken by aeroplane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months later, the Royal Flying Corps was formed, and over the last century, air power has moved from a peripheral role in military strategy, to a central one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Air Force today is integral to the defence of the United Kingdom and an indispensible part of operations to protect national security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, helping to provide the Libyan people with the protection, and indeed the courage, they needed to overthrow the brutal dictator who had oppressed them for so long;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer, policing the skies over London to ensure the delivery of a safe and secure Olympics; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I speak now, in the skies over Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of these operations, air-power alone would not be enough; but in none of these operations could success have been achieved without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk today about the future development of the Royal Air Force and its contribution to the security of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as the theme of this conference suggests, I will do so in the context of partnership - international and domestic - military and civilian - government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partnerships that the RAF will need to enhance if it is to continue to assure the delivery air power in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A century in which space and cyber space will emerge as increasingly important domains of the overall strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in which the evolution of technology is already changing how air power can be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that the pilot of an aircraft need not be sitting in a cockpit, but can be in a bunker 3,000 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me first set out the overarching framework within which the Royal Air Force will continue to transform its capability, structure and infrastructure over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transformation"&gt;Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I became Secretary of State just over a year ago, the campaign in Libya was entering its final phase - with Gaddafi and his family expelled from Tripoli and holed up in Sirte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first day on the job was partly taken up with targeting decisions for air strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any notion that Defence was ‘just another Government Department with a budget problem’ was quickly dispelled.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, I was having to navigate my foundation lesson in “military speak”, that impenetrable language designed to repel outsiders, and to underline just how different Defence is from other parts of Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw at first hand, literally on my first day, that of course the first priority was then and will remain, success on operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the very raison d’etre of our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that our country is defended, our national security interests protected at home and abroad, and our values projected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan we are clear that we will end combat operations by December 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the meantime, we must complete the mission: training and preparing the Afghan Forces to take on the burden of security, so that we can bring our personnel home, while protecting the gains that we have so expensively made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we and our ISAF partners draw down, we will be more dependent than ever on the air-bridge, and the RAF’s work in sustaining this link is critical to delivering success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a third of the Royal Air Force’s strength is currently contributing directly to operations and standing commitments -  in Afghanistan and on other tasks defending the UK and our dependent territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RAF is an integral part of the front-line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just as I am clear on the priority of operations, I am equally clear that without budgetary discipline, the need for the kind of reductions and tough decisions taken as part of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, would come upon us again - and we will have gained nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, budgetary discipline has to be the supporting foundation of the transformation to Future Force 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence equipment programme needs to be balanced and sustainable if the Armed Forces are to have the confidence that the capabilities promised will actually be delivered, on time and to requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now half-way through this Parliament and I can confirm that we in the Ministry of Defence now have a balanced budget with an affordable equipment programme, backed by, although you might not realise it reading the British media, what will still be the fourth largest Defence budget in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this changes the dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By maintaining discipline, sensibly managing in-year budgets, and tightening our long-term projections, we can begin to release the contingencies that we have built into the budget, to support further investments in capability, confident that there is a sustainable funding stream to deliver them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, since the beginning of this financial year, the new discipline in our budgetary regime has allowed us to give the go ahead for a series of equipment projects for the air environment over and above the committed equipment programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes targeting pods for fast jets, better protection systems for Tornado GR4, and enhancements to MERLIN Helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The powerful, adaptable RAF of Future Force 2020 is taking shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The re-formation of 13 Squadron at RAF Waddington, announced last week, will double the RAF Predator capability in the skies over Afghanistan, flying these remotely piloted air systems from ground stations in the UK for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was proud earlier this year, to be in Fort Worth to take delivery of the UK’s first F-35 Lightning II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightning II is one of the clearest examples of Britain’s determination to stay in the top rank of military powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest examples of our determination to maintain an advanced, powerful and flexible combat air capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at the heart of our regeneration of Carrier Strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A world-class capability, able to deploy anywhere in the world and jointly operated by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With land based initial operating capability in 2018, allowing the platform to deploy as part of the UK’s contingent combat air capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And initial flights off HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a decade away, as our critics complain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just over 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deployed outside home waters, the new Carrier will routinely have Lightning II jets embarked with personnel from both Services, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been speculation in the media, much of it, as usual, ill-informed, around our intentions for operating the Carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me be absolutely clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RAF and the Royal Navy are working together to deliver a joint force that can operate from land bases in the UK, from the carriers when they are at sea, and from forward operating bases when deployed abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the direction of the Chief of the Defence Staff, the concept of operations for carrier enabled power projection is being developed in line with the adaptable posture set out in the SDSR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A concept of operations that will embrace both carrier strike and littoral manoeuvre operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is a substantial process, and dependent in part on decisions due to taken as part of the next SDSR in 2015 on the use of the second carrier to produce continuous carrier capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a joint asset, Lightning II will provide us with a flexible capability that will out-perform anything we’ve been able to put in the air before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with the UK enjoying a 15 % share of the industrial work, the peak production period is likely to sustain 25,000 jobs in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joint Strike Fighter project was conceived as a multi-national programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s tier one status in the programme speaks eloquently of the UK’s close partnership with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to turn now to the theme of international partnerships - because that relationship with the US is the UK’s most important, but by no means only, relationship upon which we rely to deliver our national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="international-partnership"&gt;International Partnership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100 years on from that very first aircraft bombing mission in Libya, NATO’s Operation Unified Protector last year proved the versatility of the RAF’s combat capabilities in the very same skies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just the precision weapons in the arsenal like Storm Shadow, dual-mode Brimstone and Paveway IV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also in the employment of Typhoon in its first multi-role contribution to operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the mission critical ISTAR assets such as Sentinel and E3-D Sentry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the strategic level, the mission demonstrated once again how air power can provide politicians with political choices short of intervention on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, as the Chief of the Air Staff has previously said, Libya is not the archetype for conflict, anymore than Afghanistan is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can learn the very valuable lessons of both campaigns as we work to deliver adaptable Armed Forces, best configured to deal with the contingencies of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The striking feature of both campaigns is the breadth of the coalition taking part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Libya operation saw 260 aircraft from 16 countries flying 26,500 sorties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of cooperation, in particular, between the RAF and the French Armee de l’Air during the campaign, was a potent demonstration of the new momentum in UK-French defence cooperation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance Force is now some 50 nations strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAF assets operate alongside those of our fellow ISAF partners…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… the Tornado GR4 force at Kandahar airport shares Tango Ramp with F16s from the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camp Bastion airfield in Helmand, controlled by the RAF, ranks as one of the busiest multi-national airfields in the world, handling up to 450 movements a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level and sophistication of the integration between coalition partners, forged in campaigns such as Afghanistan and Libya, needs to be maintained and then taken forward long after those campaigns are behind us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the RAF, this interoperability with allies has become second nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last century, from the Allied air campaigns of the 2nd world war, through the Berlin Air Lift, to the Gulf War, Balkans and Kosovo campaigns of the 1990s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this century in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RAF has honed its understanding and interoperability, operating as part of multi-national coalitions over many, many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wide international audience that I see before me today, is testament to the strength of the relationship that the RAF has forged with its fellow military aviators from across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That operational experience is now being built upon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tornados from RAF Marham have deployed to the Middle East for a series of exercises to work with partner nations on Exercise SHAHEEN STAR - and soon Typhoons from RAF Leuchars will be joining exercises in UAE and Oman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Typhoon has also been flying with allies from the Five Power Defence Arrangement as part of Exercise BERSAMA LIMA 11, in Malaysia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all part of putting into practice the kind of interoperability we will need in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-partnership-challenge"&gt;The Partnership Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is another strategic lesson we can draw from recent operations, particularly Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While on the one hand, Libya showed the strength of our the NATO alliances and our partnerships, the operation also, to be frank, cruelly exposed the imbalances and weaknesses in NATO and thus the scale of the task facing European NATO nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as former US Defence Secretary Robert Gates pointed out at the time, “The most advanced fighter aircraft are little use if allies do not have the means to identify, process, and strike targets as part of an integrated campaign”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could argue this is the very nature of coalition operations, with each partner providing the skills and assets that it can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the case of Libya it shone a bright light on relative military and political capabilities in terms of who “could but wouldn’t”; and who “would but couldn’t”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the United States reflecting, in its strategic posture, the growing importance of the developing strategic challenge in the Pacific, the nations of Europe must find the political will to take on more responsibility for our own back yard, and fund the capabilities to allow that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly that means, shouldering the major burden in the Balkans and the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also being prepared, if necessary, to take a bigger role in relation to North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that Europe, as a whole, needs to do more, at a time when the reality is that, across the continent, aggregate defence expenditure is certain to fall in the short term and, at best, recover slowly in the medium term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the challenge is stark: if we can’t spend more, we must do things differently;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximising the capability we can collectively squeeze out of the resources we have; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing interoperability, closing capability gaps through joint working and greater specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the UK is overhauling its ISTAR, strategic lift and combat air capabilities as part of the transition to Future Force 2020 with the new Atlas and Voyager fleets operating alongside the C17, Sentry, Sentinel, and Airseeker as well as a range of remotely piloted air systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These forces will allow us to offer capacity to share with our international partners in new, innovative and mutually beneficial ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, for the time being at least, we will depend on others for support with maritime patrol aircraft, when we need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is not just about smart behaviour by NATO members per-se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Britain, Smart Defence is also about making the Alliance more flexible, encouraging collaboration among groups of allies within the Alliance, and with partners outside the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Libya and Afghanistan have shown how agile NATO can be in incorporating the contributions of outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should capitalise on this experience in making it easier for non-NATO nations and key potential partners to contribute to NATO’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partnership challenge encompasses more than just bi-lateral and multi-lateral government-to-government or military-to-military relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also encompasses those who supply and support our equipment too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="partnership-with-industry"&gt;Partnership with Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With shrinking Defence budgets in many advanced countries, and ever greater appetite and capability for involvement in design, development and production of sophisticated military equipment in the emerging economies, it is a tough business environment out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition will be intense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic challenges involved in maintaining a high tech, highly capable, air force now and in the future are considerable -and the technical challenges equally high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success will require a genuinely transparent collaboration in aerospace, between industry and government to keep overheads down, to maintain essential R&amp;amp;D, and to build healthy export order books while making sure the unit cost is affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are embarking on some major changes to make the MOD a more capable and intelligent customer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restructuring equipment acquisition and through-life support;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing in private sector management skills through a partnership to re-inforce the military and civilian specialists who form the backbone of the Defence equipment and procurement organisation;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also looking at how the acquisition processes can take better account of the commercial landscape - building in exportability - making sure the wider package on offer to potential customers is as attractive as it can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those years of over-programming in Defence created a climate of uncertainty that was beneficial neither to our Armed Forces, nor to industry - with neither side able to plan properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide industry with as much information as possible to plan, we will be publishing a summary of the equipment plan in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will provide greater granularity than ever before about how money will be spent across the breadth of capabilities by breaking down spending for equipment and support alongside the judgement of the National Audit Office on the robustness of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong aerospace sector in the UK - manufacturing, servicing, and crucially exporting - is a vital part of the Government’s strategy for rebalancing our economy so it can return to sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is also an onus on our suppliers to provide better value for money for the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need our partners to be lean and flexible, capable of operating in a more competitive defence marketplace, responsive to the needs of Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry support for air operations in Libya last year shows what can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering and sustaining capability - as well as supplying equipment and developing new technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently 5,000 contractors directly supporting our operations in Afghanistan, including the vital role played by the RAF. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Total Support Force’ concept, set out in the White Paper, seeks to integrate more fully the contribution of the private sector to operations. Industry, the Armed Forces, MOD, civilians and industry working more closely than ever to achieve their mutual goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the way of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Future Force 2020, we are building a force fit for a more uncertain world;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where we may not know in advance what conditions we will be fighting in;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where we can only hope to meet the challenges of modern conflict and protect national security by exploiting all the advantages we possess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of our advanced technology and industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of our international alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the advantage of our highly trained, highly capable people -  working together as a total force to deliver the world’s most effective expeditionary military capability outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RAF brings unique capabilities to the delivery of joint effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid reaction, speed, agility and precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control of the air and the ability to exploit that domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic lift to project power at range;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactical manoeuvre and re-supply on the battlefield;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the real-time intelligence and awareness that airborne ISTAR provides of the battle space as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is the people of the RAF that deliver this effect. Our people are our principal asset. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just the pilot; the air crew, the engineers, the planners, the whole edifice of the RAF that supports the delivery of British air power at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as we enter the remembrance period, and honour those who have sacrificed so much for the freedom of this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us express our confidence in the men and women of today’s Royal Air Force; in their determination to demonstrate the same spirit and commitment to duty as their illustrious forbears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that our skies will continue to be safe in their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>MOD fuel depot emergency exercise declared success</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activity was all part of the MOD-led exercise to rehearse its emergency plans in the event of a spill from the Thanckes oil depot at Torpoint opposite HM Naval Base Devonport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise scenario involves a simulated fuel release from a split hose at the depot (run by the Oil and Pipelines Agency) that refuels Royal Navy, Royal Fleet Auxiliary and other vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local residents saw an increase in traffic on land and water from the emergency services and the Royal Navy and MOD enacting the scenario. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diesel fuel oil was initially contained with inflatable booms as it was driven up river by wind and tide towards the River Lynher, but was prevented from spreading into the Lynher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thin film of surface oil was then dispersed within the boomed area by the movement of tugs and removed through a combination of a suction machine and soaking floats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commander Carl Necker, Royal Navy headed the exercise as the Queen’s Harbour Master with responsibility for ensuring the free and safe operation of military traffic in the Port of Plymouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The exercise scenario involved a simulated fuel release at the depot which refuels the Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1657/MOD_fuel_depot_emergency_exercise_declared_success2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The exercise scenario involved a simulated fuel release at the depot which refuels the Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Vicki Benwell, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was a good opportunity to exercise our contingency plans for fuel spills with all relevant agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This worked successfully and we were able to stand up the command and control centre within Devonport Naval Base from which to direct the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The second aim was to deploy effectively the containment and clean-up measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having achieved this we will now provide the feedback to outside independent consultants who will provide us with a report which we will analyse and we can see how to integrate improvements into our future contingency plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the MOD have well-rehearsed accident procedures and the exercise was to satisfy safety regulators who inspected the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise is run by the MOD, Royal Navy, Oil Pipelines Agency and their partners, including Cornwall County Council, Plymouth City Council and emergency services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Fire Minister backs call for action on false alarms</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire Minister Brandon Lewis has called for more to be done to combat the 250,000 false fire alarms across the country each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a speech to the Fire Sector Summit at Wembley on Wednesday, he pointed to new figures showing that, in London alone, a fire engine is called once every 12 minutes to a false alarm, at a cost of £34 million every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, throughout the country, there were nearly a quarter of a million false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to an audience of fire professionals the Minister argued that many of these could be prevented through the use of new technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Lewis said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe that technology can address this issue. To that end, I have asked the industry to see what can be done to drive down false alarms through improved equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fire Sector Federation has set up a group that is already looking at the use of more sophisticated technology such as multi-sensor fire detectors which can detect more than one factor such as smoke and heat. These are much more accurate at identifying whether there is a real fire or whether it is an environmental factor such as dust or steam that is triggering an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, improved procedures can hugely cut the number of false alarms. A well known food processing company reduced its false alarms from nearly 50 a year to less than one by training fire marshals to investigate the cause of an alarm before the fire and rescue authority was called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Mr Lewis went on to say that by working together the sector could find financial savings as well as save lives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At a time when every penny counts, this is an obvious area in which to make large savings. Dealing with the number of false alarms has got to be a priority and I would encourage the industry and fire and rescue authorities to work together to develop a common approach to cutting back on something that not only wastes money, but potentially could cost lives, and I look forward to hearing their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Fire sector summit 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to say how delighted I am to be invited to speak to this summit - an event that grows in importance every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am particularly pleased that the summit brings together all parts of the fire industry - not only those who deliver the fire and rescue service at the sharp end, but all those who, often behind the scenes, do so much to ensure the buildings we live in and the products we use on a daily basis, are safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-success-story"&gt;A success story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in terms of fires you should all congratulate yourselves on a considerable success story. In England, fire fatalities and non-fatal casualties fell by 34% and 54% respectively between 2001 to 2002 and 2011 to 2012, and the average area of fire damage fell by 20% in dwellings and around 10% in other buildings during the same period. Last year, total fires fell by 6% to 227,000. I very much hope that these trends continue way into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of government’s commitment to maintaining a high profile focus on prevention activity, the Fire Kills campaign is currently running its hugely successful national advertising campaign. As with last year, we are encouraging everyone to test their smoke alarms when they change their clocks this weekend as you are four times more likely to die in a fire if you do not have a working smoke alarm. I would ask that in order to extend the reach and breadth of the campaign, you use your own websites to disseminate this important message. By working together we have the opportunity to really drive home the importance of fire safe behaviour and maintain the downward trend on fire deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interaction between the fire industry and fire and rescue is a complex one - and for that reason I am delighted that the Fire Sector Federation is playing an increasingly important role in pulling all parts of the fire industry together, into a forum where ideas and knowledge can be exchanged. And I would particularly like to thank Brian Robinson, the Chairman of the Federation, for his hard work and perseverance in bringing the Federation to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-importance-of-co-operation"&gt;The importance of co-operation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth is a top priority for this government. Supporting business growth for both new and existing companies is fundamental to our approach. And encouraging the creation of new businesses and sectors is crucial to this country’s future. These new businesses will help to create the necessary wealth and growth, and much needed jobs. But we need also to ensure that both new and existing businesses are strong and resilient, including safeguarding and protecting them from the devastating effects of a fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of you here today will know a fire can result in a business loss both in terms of its employees, its contribution to the local economy, and ability to recover and trade again in the aftermath of an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I urge the fire sector to go out and proactively engage with representative bodies for industry and commerce and make the case for effective and proportionate fire protection - passive and active interventions - in all areas of business in England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="false-alarms"&gt;False alarms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry also has a vitally important role to play in ensuring that we make the best use of innovative technology. You will know better than me the scope for technology to improve resilience to fire - but one area where more can be done is in limiting the number of false alarms. Last year there were 249,000 fire false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London Fire Brigade says that despite a reduction of 23% in false alarms in the last 5 years, a fire engine is still called to a false alarm every 12 minutes in the capital, costing an estimated 34 million every year. More importantly, these unnecessary calls impact on the Brigade’s ability to attend real incidents, deliver training and carry out vital community safety work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that technology can address this issue. To that end I have asked Brian Robinson to see what the industry itself can do to drive down false alarms through improved technology. Brian has asked a Fire Sector Federation working group under Martin Harvey to look into this issue - and I very much look forward to hearing their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="workforce-development"&gt;Workforce development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where I see significant improvement is in relation to workforce development in fire and rescue services. Here collaborative working between the Sector Skills Council - Skills for Fire and Rescue, and the Chief Fire Officers Association amongst others - is starting to produce tangible results, especially in the risk critical areas of intervention activity. Such work helps underpin integrated risk management plans, interoperability, national resilience and common working. Much energy is being devoted to this work. I would like to thank Max Hood, the chair of the National Occupational Committee for his efforts in leading this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="public-procurement"&gt;Public procurement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that many of you have an interest in public procurement and accessing new markets. This is an area where government is keen to help. As you may know, the government has put in place the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder" title="Contracts Finder"&gt;Contracts Finder&lt;/a&gt; website, aimed at making it easier for suppliers to find and apply for public sector contracts. It is the main source of government opportunities worth more than £10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My department has already approached certain fire and rescue authorities to help populate pipelines and is very grateful for the assistance given to date. We are now asking all fire and rescue authorities for help to get as much information on future procurements in the pipeline - this should not be difficult as fire and rescue authorities should already be publishing this information existing contracts and tenders under the local government transparency code. The information on future procurements will help strengthen the UK supply chain by identifying current gaps between supply and demand and giving industry the confidence to invest for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is also committed to devolving power away from Whitehall so that fire and rescue authorities can decide how they can deliver services in a way that best meets their communities’ needs. I hope that the fire sector can join together to develop new ways of working and further innovation that can stimulate growth for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="youth-employment"&gt;Youth employment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to speak a little about youth employment. In response to the challenge of youth unemployment, year the Deputy Prime Minister has launched a £1 billion Youth Contract to help unemployed people get a job. The Youth Contract will provide a number of new opportunities for young people, including apprenticeships and work experience placements. Many of you will be aware of the The Prince’s Trust Fire Industry Scheme, and some have supported it. I wish to thank you for that, and encourage others to get involved if they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a number of fire and rescue authorities have started training apprentices. I was particularly impressed to hear that in Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service 12 young people have started a community safety apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apprentices are young people who have already had some contact with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, for example through the Prince’s Trust courses, cadets and Fire Fly following a targeted recruitment campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support them through the application process, they put on a 10-day pre-recruitment course - run by Salford City College - to give candidates an understanding of working with people in the communities they would serve, as well as meeting a community safety adviser who is already in the job, so they know exactly what the role entails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to commend Greater Manchester for this valuable initiative, and wish the new entrants every possible success in their apprenticeship, and future careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="retained-duty-system-firefighters"&gt;Retained duty system firefighters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, the one area where industry and the fire and rescue service co-operate on a daily, if not hourly, basis is in the retained duty system. There is no doubt that the retained duty system is the backbone of the fire and rescue response in large swathes of the United Kingdom. We must, as leaders in the fire sector, wherever possible, bring to people’s attention the valuable work done by retained duty firefighters, and encourage employers and members of the public to offer their services to this essential service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>RAF station supports electronic warfare exercise</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trial Mace XIV, held at RAF Spadeadam, was the first to be hosted by the UK, and RAF Leeming’s role in hosting some of Europe’s top fighter pilots was significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise is the latest in a series of initiatives which have been run by NATO countries on an ad hoc basis since being initiated in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first trials were conducted purely for the development of ‘chaff’ - a technique that was originally developed during the Second World War to decoy radar systems and effectively ‘mask’ aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, electronic warfare has progressed significantly thanks to technological advancements, and subsequent Trial Maces have been developed to meet new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="An F-16 aircraft at RAF Leeming" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1512/RAF_station_supports_electronic_warfare_exercise2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An F-16 aircraft at RAF Leeming [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squadron Leader Paul Sanders, Large Aircraft Trials Management Officer of the Air Platform Protection, Test and Evaluation Squadron at RAF Waddington, was one of the Trial Mace XIV organisers. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every nationality comes with its own testing agenda. Some have new equipment and some have new techniques so it’s varied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial itself involved personnel from Belgium, Austria, Canada, Spain, Italy, Greece, Germany, Italy and the US, to name but a few. RAF Leeming hosted around 50 Turkish and 30 Polish personnel, along with a total of five F-16 jets. As a station with a fast jet background, RAF Leeming was delighted to help with such important trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wing Commander Fin Monahan, Officer Commanding Operations Wing, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;RAF Leeming is ideally situated for supporting a wide range of exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This year has been particularly busy with the station supporting various helicopter exercises in preparation for Afghanistan operations, providing large scale transport and parachute exercises, and also providing a location for the Korean display team to prepare its aircraft and pilots for award-winning displays in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Notably, the station also played a major role in preparing for the air defence of the Olympics. It was, therefore, an obvious location for hosting Trial Mace and the personnel on the station took great pride in providing a base for both the Polish and Turkish F-16 operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squadron Leader Sanders was delighted with the support provided to his team:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The support from RAF Leeming has been fantastic. Without it the NATO fast jet aircraft flying during Trial Mace would not have gained such benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Its relatively close proximity to RAF Spadeadam and the direct contribution of RAF Leeming personnel at all levels made it ideally suited to support such detachments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Charred clocks bring an emotional reminder that it’s Time to Test</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire Kills - When you change your clock test your smoke alarm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hard-hitting campaign offers a timely reminder that changing our clocks isn’t the only important task to carry out over the weekend of 27/28 October - the clear Fire Kills message is that it’s time to take life-saving action and test our smoke alarms too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2237695.jpg" alt="Fire Kills poster showing a child"&gt;“Do you swear on your child’s life to test your smoke alarm this weekend?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple task of making sure our smoke alarms work is something that many often forget. But people are more than four times as likely to die in a fire if they do not have a working smoke alarm, so the Fire Kills campaign is using the twice-yearly clock change chore to remind people that it’s time to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images of charred timepieces that bring to mind a child’s bedside table, a grandparents’ mantelpiece, and a quiet night in front of the TV, pull on the heartstrings to remind householders of the lives at stake if their smoke alarm isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011-12, there were 30,709 accidental fires in the home, resulting in 187 fatalities and more than 6,000 injuries. The number of fatalities was 12 per cent lower than in 2010-11 and Fire Kills aims to keep these figures going down because behind every death is a tragic story of loss for family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost half of those people who died in dwelling fires last year were aged 65 and over. This year the campaign is urging carers, family and close neighbours to offer to test older people’s smoke alarms for them as they are often out of easy reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a working smoke alarm can buy people valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999, only half of all householders who own a smoke alarm say that they test it is working on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign aims to make testing our smoke alarms part of every household’s routine when changing our clocks, potentially saving many lives in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire Minister Brandon Lewis said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The smoke alarm is a proven saviour, and while the great majority of homes now own one, that’s simply not enough - it must be working to save your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe from the worst should never be left to chance. That’s why this campaign reminds us of exactly what’s at stake if the worst should happen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The clock change offers the perfect prompt to carry out the simple task of testing your alarms and offering to test for other people - especially older friends and relatives who may find it difficult to do it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Last year, nearly one in seven adults tested their alarms over the clock change weekends and we want many more to test this year. A simple task, taking just a few seconds, can mean the difference between life and death, so add it to your ‘to do’ list now. Our message is clear - it’s time to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You’re more than four times as likely to die in a fire without a working smoke alarm. But despite this, only half of the people who own an alarm say they take the time to test that it’s working.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Almost half the people who die in accidental fires in their home are aged over 65. Let’s reduce this shocking statistic by offering to help older family members or other elderly people we care for and test their alarm for them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A smoke alarm can give you the vital time you need to get out, stay out and call 999 in a house fire. As you put your clocks back on the weekend of 27/28 October take an extra moment to make sure your alarm is working properly - it could save your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen out for the radio adverts…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://web-cdn.coull.biz/communities/MP3Player/MP3Player.swf" alt="embed: "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help keep yourself and your loved ones safe in the home by following these simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999. Make sure you fit one on every level of your home and test them regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make testing your smoke alarm part of your household routine. Test the alarm by pressing the button regularly; change your battery once a year or invest in a 10-year alarm; and clean the alarm casing twice a year to ensure dust doesn’t block the sensor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whatever happens, never remove the battery in your smoke alarm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure that everyone in your home knows what to do in a fire and practise your escape route.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For more information visit the &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.facebook.com/firekills"&gt;Fire Kills Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want an extra nudge to test your smoke alarm regularly, try setting an automatic reminder. Safelincs, in partnership with the Fire Kills campaign, has created a free service that reminds you, by email or text, when it’s time to test your smoke alarm, change the battery or renew the unit. The service is completely free and can be cancelled at any time. For more information visit the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.safelincs.co.uk/reminders/"&gt;Safelincs website&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;British Summer Time (BST) ends on the last Sunday in October. The clocks go back at 2.00 am BST on 28 October to 1.00 am Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fire statistics can be found on the DCLG website at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/monitorq1q42012"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/monitorq1q42012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research conducted by Ipsos API on the 2011/12 Fire Kills campaign showed that 14 per cent of respondents (total 1690) tested their smoke alarms over the March clock change weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Green light for £37m Viking regeneration</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used extensively by the Royal Marines, the 99 Viking BVS10 vehicles, which can be launched straight from the back of a ship and propelled through water before landing for a beach assault, are in line for a major overhaul by BAE Systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were deployed to Afghanistan in 2006 for their versatility across tough terrains before they were later replaced by Warthog. The Vikings will now be fitted with new mine blast protection bodywork and brought back to their original amphibious standard, having been adapted for the rigours of land operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Philip Dunne, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The £37m mid-life upgrade to the Viking fleet of amphibious vehicles will keep these highly capable vehicles in service with the Royal Marines into the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With a balanced Defence Budget for the first time in a generation, we are able to deliver with confidence the equipment our Armed Forces require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are delighted that the contract for the regeneration of our Viking amphibious vehicles has been announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Viking is an essential asset for the Royal Marines in conducting short notice crisis response operations around the world and any modification which enhances operational effectiveness and makes life that bit safer for our personnel is always welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 99 Viking vehicles, 19 are set to be fitted with top-mounted guns and nine more will allow for the firing of an 81mm mortar from the vehicle. All will have improvements made to their braking and suspension systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as well as new front and rear car hulls, the Vikings will have the latest mine-protected V-shaped underbody which is designed to protect the occupants should they drive over an explosive device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regeneration programme is expected to be completed by the end of 2014 and will secure the vehicle’s service life until its expected out of service date of 2031.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The announcement follows the signing of a concordat between the MoD and the Bloodhound Project by Defence Minister Philip Dunne and Bloodhound Director Richard Noble, which outlines their commitment to work together to achieve common goals. This includes promoting Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in the UK and raising the profile of science and technology in Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloodhound incorporates many advanced technologies with direct relevance to the Armed Forces, ranging from materials and structures through to control systems and data management. The revolutionary technology being built into Bloodhound today paves the way for the equipment that will be protecting our Armed Forces tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team of five REME Engineers will assist in the construction and maintenance of the car over the next two years and will be vital to the success of the project both in the UK and during the record attempts in South Africa in 2013 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The REME Engineers will work alongside Royal Air Force pilot, Wing Commander Andy Green, who will drive the new car, powered by a Typhoon jet engine and a hybrid rocket, during the record attempts. He holds the current land speed record as the driver of Thrust SuperSonic Car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip Dunne, Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted to sign this concordat with the Bloodhound Project today. Bloodhound is an inspirational project that will have a lasting legacy for the UK by inspiring future generations into careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. These are essential skills to British industry, particularly within the Defence sector, and it is vital that we nurture them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is also a great opportunity for the Army’s mechanical engineers to share experience and develop their skills whilst working on this innovative technology here in the UK. That experience will feed directly back into the front line as they progress through their Army careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement builds on the Royal Air Force’s already considerable involvement with the project, through Wg Cdr Green and the retired Typhoon jet engine that will power Bloodhound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Noble, Project Director of the Bloodhound Project said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bloodhound is a cutting edge, high-technology project, operating on a global stage in front of a huge audience. We are delighted that the MoD and REME will be joining us and sharing in this unique adventure. Their young engineers have great skills and attitude and will make a tremendous contribution to the building and running of the car. In turn, they will be ‘hands on’ with an extraordinary mix of aerospace, Formula 1 and space technology, and experience the education programme which is at the heart of Bloodhound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craftsman Rob Fenn, 19, a member of the REME support team said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have come through the apprentice system and have been lucky to have been picked to work on the most awe inspiring engineering project where I can use the skills I have learned to build the world’s fastest car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For me, Bloodhound is rocket-powered professional development. I have no doubt that this will boost my career and open my eyes to the most incredible science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Army signallers assist the flood relief effort in North Yorkshire</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty soldiers from 2nd Signal Regiment based in Fulford, York, filled and laid thousands of sandbags in Peckitt Street in York city centre in support of the emergency services, local authorities and other agencies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flood levels in the River Ouse rose and peaked on the morning of Thursday 27 September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another 70 soldiers were requested to assist the flood relief effort in Cawood, near Selby, where more than 4,000 sandbags were filled and laid overnight to bolster the existing flood defences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were working together with the other agencies near the Cawood swing bridge and 500 metres either side of it,” said Major David Orr, who headed up the military team at the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There were quite a lot of properties at risk and also a pub - and you don’t want to risk a pub flooding! The sandbags were already there in pallets and we placed them, but some of the locations were quite difficult to get to and, in some places, the lads carried the sandbags quite a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For us, this was the last day of training before we deploy to Afghanistan and, after a year of training, this was something different. We very much enjoyed the opportunity to help the local community and they made us feel very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regiment is due to deploy to Afghanistan for a six-month tour at the end of October. The soldiers will be working at several locations within Helmand province providing telecommunications, IT and secure communications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are very much part of the local community in North Yorkshire and were happy to join the effort as extra pairs of hands, helping out with the sandbagging at what has been a very difficult time,” said Lieutenant Colonel Colin Vaudin, the Commanding Officer of 2nd Signal Regiment, which is based in Imphal Barracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The soldiers returned to barracks about 6am this morning [Thursday] and are now catching up on some well-earned sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;York’s signallers also helped out during the floods in 2000 and were subsequently awarded the Freedom of the City of York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/royal-navy-unveils-new-carrier-engineering-development-facility"/>
    <title>Royal Navy unveils new carrier engineering development facility</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 65,000 tonne carrier - which weighs three times as much as HMS Illustrious - is currently being assembled at Babcock’s dockyard in Rosyth and will be able to take up to 40 aircraft, almost twice the current capacity of a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the programme, part of HMS Queen Elizabeth’s state-of-the-art mission system has been pre-assembled at HMS Collingwood in Fareham, Hampshire. The result is a physical representation of the aircraft carrier’s Operations Room and Flying Control Centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ‘brain’ of the ship, the mission system brings together air traffic control, navigation, tactical picture compilation, communications and mission planning for the embarked F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Merlin helicopters. It will also provide engineering and logistic support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facility will hold engineering tests and trials using the same equipment that will eventually be installed on the ship in Rosyth. Being located in HMS Collingwood it has the benefit of allowing the establishment’s Royal Navy trainees to take part in large scale trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By manning every operations room position with Royal Navy personnel ensures the equipment can be tested and loaded to its full capacity - something that has never been done before with previous mission systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Named after Admiral Sir Lumley Lyster, the mastermind behind the Taranto raid and architect of the Royal Navy’s carrier strategy during the Second World War, Lyster Building at HMS Collingwood marks the collaboration between the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, Navy Command and Flag Officer Sea Training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, officially opened the building, adding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Admiral Lyster was a leader and innovator in delivering air power from the sea and this will be the primary role for the Queen Elizabeth Class carriers as part of our Future Navy 2020 vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is apt therefore that the Aircraft Carrier Alliance should take him as their inspiration in developing this world-class engineering and training facility that will help ensure HMS Queen Elizabeth enters front line service before the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equipment used in Lyster building will be moved to the HMS Queen Elizabeth once personnel have been trained in a bid to keep costs low. The first Royal Navy weapon engineers are set to join the carrier in 2013 in Rosyth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Chief Fire Officers Association Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to be here today in my second full week in my new job. I’d like congratulate Vij (Randeniya) on his election as the new CFOA President and thank Lee (Howell) for all his work as part of the presidential team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to put on record my thanks to fire and rescue authorities for the important role they played in torch relays across the United Kingdom and during the Olympic and Paralympics Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the role that fire and rescue authorities played has gone almost unnoticed in the public eye, the effort and resources which were put in place were greatly appreciated across Government. I am pleased that a number of fire and rescue authority staff who made a significant contribution in delivery of services will be receiving recognition in the form of a commemorative medallion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to play tribute to Bob Neill, who I know had a deep understanding of the issues you face, a huge knowledge of the sector, and who worked closely with you on resetting the relationship between central and local government, devolving power and responsibility to the front line professionals, to communities and their local elected representatives - where it rightly sits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased to have been given this brief and I look forward to working with you and your elected members in the coming weeks, months and, hopefully, years. I’m particularly pleased to say that my new brief maintains the link between fire and rescue and local government. Alongside my fire responsibilities I am also local government Minister. This is particularly important to me as I am a keen proponent of local determination on service delivery, on prioritisation and on spending decisions. Keeping the fire and local government link is vital in this and I am sure you will be pleased to hear that I intend to continue Bob’s good work here, embedding localism, continuing the integration of funding via the business rates system, and more importantly, getting out of the way to let you do what you do best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fire-prevention"&gt;Fire prevention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will of course, continue to support you where it is appropriate. Thankfully, the number of fires and associated fatalities and injuries continue to fall. The latest statistics show fire deaths in the home have more than halved in the last twenty years - and fell 12 per cent last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic achievement and the Fire Kills campaign is a great example of how effective a partnership between Government and local fire and rescue authorities can be. The campaign’s annual report for 2011/12 was published last week. It clearly demonstrates the range and impact of fire prevention activity being delivered by both the Department through its media campaign, and by its partners. The outstanding success of this campaign is, as you know, in large part due to the sterling, and often innovative, work undertaken at the local level to embed its fire safety messages with both the general public, and with those who may be especially vulnerable to the risks from fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the commitment of you and your local partners to the prevention agenda saves lives and resources. It ensures that our communities are safer places, less exposed to the destruction and devastation caused by fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge must now be to maintain that clear focus on fire prevention, community safety and resilience. Working together allows us to deliver consistent safety messages, tailoring and targeting the campaign to maximise its effectiveness at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next month, the Fire Kills campaign will again be running the hugely successful national advertising campaign to encourage everyone to test that their smoke alarms are working when changing their clocks. I’m sure you’ll already be considering how best to support this at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working together we have the opportunity to really drive home the importance of fire safe behaviour and maintain the downward trend on fire deaths. Given its impact, I am committed to maintaining a high profile focus on community fire prevention and safety activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="resilience"&gt;Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prevention activity doesn’t just relate to improving fire safety. We have a model for civil contingency delivery that fits with our views of localism: planning and action at local level based on local risks and with partners having local accountability to make your localities more resilient places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know fire and rescue authorities are increasingly providing strategic leadership to local multi-agency emergency planning activity, with Chief Fire Officers chairing four of England’s 38 local resilience forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means fire and rescue authorities working with partners locally to better identify and mitigate complex resilience risks that could disrupt everyday life; including flooding, severe winter weather, disruption to fuel supplies or security threats. I hope, as I’m sure you do, that your role in responding to these types of emergencies is not called upon. But in my role as Minister for fire, resilience and emergencies I am keen to hear more about the good examples of the role of fire and rescue authorities in local multi-agency planning that strengthens our ability to quickly respond and recover from disruptive events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-clear-vision-for-local-delivery-the-national-framework"&gt;A clear vision for local delivery: the national framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very heart of the Government’s ambition is putting power back where it belongs - in communities and with the locally elected councilors who represent them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire and rescue authorities have been empowered with greater freedoms and flexibilities. You now have general powers of competence and an equivalent general power along with the ability to consult locally to allow charging for additional activities including the option for charging for persistent false reports. These are good examples of central Government stepping back and letting you get on with your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fire and Rescue National Framework is currently proceeding through parliament, and will be fully in force in October this year. I’ve come to it new. But I like what I see. For me, it embodies the right approach; setting high level principles instead of detailed requirements - it’s ‘what’ not ‘how’. I am pleased to hear that CFOA has welcomed this document. I would also like to thank you for the support and advice I understand you gave to officials as part of the working group. I think we should all be proud of the Framework, one that moves away from prescription to empowerment, and one that clearly sets out three bold priorities for fire and rescue authorities to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify and assess the full range of foreseeable fire and rescue related risks their areas face, make provision for prevention and protection activities and respond to incidents appropriately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be accountable to communities for the service they provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that this includes the business community. I firmly believe that businesses have the right to expect that those enforcing regulatory compliance do so in accordance with the fundamental principles of better regulation. I know that CFOA are keen to address shortcomings in this area and to lead work at the local level to develop fire safety audit and enforcement responsibilities to reflect more closely the aspirations that businesses have. Essentially, this means for helpful, proportionate and consistent advice on compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that economic growth and business support is our number one priority, I commend you for your approach and look forward to a positive progression of this significant tranche of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our national resilience to major fire and rescue related risks remains a priority for government. But we can only do this together, through true partnership, working across all local and national responders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we have put in place the Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board, and it is already bringing key partners together to consider national resilience issues. Of course, government will continue to set the strategic direction, but our approach to national resilience must be based on and drawn from local capability alongside your professional expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can only prepare effectively if we have an approach to resilience based on local expertise and knowledge. Communities rightly expect their local fire and rescue authorities to play their part in keeping the country safe; every major emergency originates as a local emergency and being able to plan effectively for all incidents and emergencies, irrespective of whether they are of a local, cross-border or national nature, is essential. &lt;br&gt;
In delivering for your communities, you need to engage them - give them a real understanding of the risks being faced and the full range of what you are doing so they can better understand why you make the decisions you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know there are some increasingly tough decisions to be made on how best to allocate prevention, protection and operational resources locally - this needs to be done in a way that meets community aspirations in an open and consultative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By giving communities a voice, you give them a choice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choice to make their views known on whether their priorities are the same as yours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;choice to come up with new ideas on service provision&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;choice to challenge you on these issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going further, we are today launching a  consultation on assurance statements, a mechanism for showing the public how the services they provide are run by their authorities. I know that some of you have mixed feelings on such statements. But for me this is about demonstrating a commitment to greater openness, showing the taxpayer how their money (including council tax) is spent, enabling communities to hold their authorities to account over how they spend the public’s money and for the decisions that they make. And some of you are already doing it very well. Every aspect of council business - including the decisions they make for the delivery of fire and rescue - should be open to public scrutiny including senior pay, councillor expenses and local services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="economic-context"&gt;Economic context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am of course mindful of the financial backdrop we all face. We have taken tough decisions necessary to reduce the budget deficit that we inherited from the last administration. Every bit of the public sector needs to do its bit to help, and local government accounts for a quarter of the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I value the incredibly important service that fire and rescue authorities deliver for local communities, and the part they play in national resilience. Despite the need to cut the national deficit, fire and rescue, as a frontline emergency service, has been given funding protection with reductions back-loaded to give more time for sensible savings to be made and reductions applied to fire and rescue authorities have been less than those applied to local authorities in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will know that we are currently consulting upon plans for 2013-15 funding as part of the business rates retention scheme - this consultation is due to close on the 24th of September and I know that many of you have already engaged in the process. I would urge those whose voices have not yet been heard to ensure they make their views known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that you are anxious to see what funding might look like from 2013, but I’m sure you will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt the consultation, nor can I pre-empt the announcements on funding for 2013/14, which I expect to be made in December in the usual way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, or maybe because of them, I know that you as the professional leaders for the fire and rescue sector are making great strides in efficiency. You have well established processes in place to use integrated risk management plans to make strategic and operational decisions on the siting of fire stations, the staffing and equipping of such stations, and hours of operation of each station. You are looking at your own service configuration to delivering services in a new environment. Some of you are looking at how you use your estate, I know for example that Merseyside are working with the police to share headquarters, that partners in the North West and partners in the South are sharing control rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last week I visited my local constituency fire and rescue authority, Norfolk, who updated me on their Combined fire and rescue, police and ambulance station in Sheringham which officially opened in January this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing buildings is also bringing collaboration on other matters, and I am sure that all of you are looking outside your own sector to see how the country’s national emergency services estate could be better used - sharing facilities and back office services. I know that you are increasingly working with the Ambulance Service and that inter-agency collaborations and interoperability are becoming increasingly important. I’m sure there are ways that we can work and share with the Ambulance Service and other partners and not only improve the services we deliver but also become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="engagement"&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in 2 weeks, you can imagine that I am only just scratching the surface of what your issues are. I have already met with Cllr Kay Hammond, who as you know is the new Chair of the Fire Services Management Committee. I outlined to Cllr Hammond that I want to strengthen my engagement with your elected politicians, and I have made clear that as well as having a more regular engagement with the FSMC, I will want to meet chairs and members of fire and rescue authorities. I know that as the professional leadership of the sector you will want to support your councilors in meetings with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to broaden my engagement with CFOA as the representative body for senior professionals. I will be meeting with your president, vice-president and vice-president elect. After this I want my engagement to be with the Board and the Council - I want to hear a broad range of views, and I will make time to engage with you on a regular basis and intend to get out and about visiting as many of your areas as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="cfra"&gt;CFRA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Framework specifically embeds the key role of the post of the Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser who provides professional, independent advice both to senior officials and Ministers. The post was first created in 2007 with Sir Ken Knight filling the position since that time. However, earlier this year Ken indicated that, having completed five years, and with the Olympics behind us it was the right time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having served in Fire and Rescue for over 40 years, including positions as Chief Fire Officer of County, Combined and Metropolitan Fire Authorities as well as the Fire Commissioner for London, Ken has provided consistent and professional advice to my predecessors as he continues to give me. I have hugely valued his input in my first weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State and I recognise the value and importance of professional advice within the Department and therefore we will shortly be advertising for Ken’s successor whilst I am delighted that Ken has agreed to remain in post until the appointment is made. I hope that senior professionals will take an interest in the post, seeing it as an opportunity to utilise their knowledge and experience to support officials and Ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also be continue to provide opportunities for secondments from the sector to contribute professional views to the development of government policy and give individuals a chance to develop and to experience the workings of government. I hope you will see DCLG as a good place to send your brightest officers as a key part of their career progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be other opportunities to say thank you to Ken but I wanted to place on record the Government’s appreciation for the support and advice he has given through the last challenging five years, and of course the previous 41 years in fire and rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that I have given you a clear indication of where my priorities lie. I recognise that there are tough times ahead but I believe fire and rescue authorities and Chief Fire Officers can provide the leadership needed to continue to deliver a trusted and excellent public service. A new and more collaborative national-local relationship provides an opportunity for fire and rescue authorities, and organisations like CFOA, to play an ever stronger part in setting the agenda and in keeping our communities and our nation safe. I look forward to working with you all. Fire and rescue services are hugely respected in the UK and have the ability to reach high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>31 Squadron Tornados head to Gulf for Ex Shaheen Star</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tornado GR4s from 31 Squadron, based at the Norfolk station, will conduct intensive training over a number of weeks, working alongside air forces from partner nations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the preparations for the exercise, a massive Antonov heavy-lift transport aircraft landed at the Norfolk base to collect some of the equipment required to support the exercise; it will depart on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base’s Tornado GR4s and personnel have been heavily involved in many exercises and operations over the last 12 months, including flying missions over Libya, as well as being currently deployed in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marham’s Acting Station Commander, Wing Commander Andy Turk, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These operations and exercises underline the need for good training and the RAF Tornado Force is delighted to have been invited by our Arab partners in the Gulf to deploy there on exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="An Antonov heavy-lift transport aircraft is loaded with equipment" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1505/31_Squadron_Tornados_head_to_Gulf_for_Ex_Shaheen_Star2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An Antonov heavy-lift transport aircraft is loaded with equipment [Picture: Senior Aircraftwoman Tracey Dobson, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The squadron will be supported by many personnel both back at RAF Marham and in the Gulf, including engineers, weapons specialists and administrative staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wing Commander Turk added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are very much looking forward to this exercise. We last flew with our Arab partners during the coalition operations over Libya last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a good opportunity to renew our professional acquaintance whilst benefiting from training together in a diverse and challenging environment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>117/2012 - Chief of Air Staff visits Royal Air Force Venue Security Force at Hainault and Olympic Park</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the nature of the work, Sir Stephen said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The vital task of the airmen and women in the Venue Security Force is vastly different from their primary day-to day duties in the Royal Air Force. Nevertheless, their inherent commitment and agility, key characteristics of the modern Royal Air Force, reflects the strong sense of duty I see consistently in our personnel at home, on operations and have witnessed again today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having seen the Park’s security procedures at first hand, the Chief of the Air Staff was able to witness the positive reaction of the public to his personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Stephen added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is not often that the public have the opportunity to meet military personnel face-to-face while they carry out their duties. To hear first hand the complimentary remarks from the public makes me especially proud of my fellow Servicemen and women”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>111/2012 - David Beckham meets military personnel on Olympic duties</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Beckham, who was a major contributor to Britain’s winning Olympic bid in 2005, visited servicemen and women from the Royal Navy, Army and RAF at the Stratford venue to see firsthand the work that’s being done to keep the Games safe and secure. He took the opportunity to thank everyone involved for their ongoing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting personnel from the Adjutant General’s Corps, the Parachute Regiment, 5 Scots and 3 Royal Anglian Regiment, Mr Beckham was quick to say how much their contribution has meant to everyone involved in the organising of the Games while posing for photos alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’ve all heard it before, but you’re doing an amazing job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Games have been incredible, especially being held in this special part of London where I grew up, and I feel so honoured to have been part of the team that planned the Olympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting the police and civilian authorities, the military has at its peak contributed more than 18,000 personnel during the busiest part of the Games. This contribution has included venue security, logistic support and the provision of a number of specialist capabilities across the maritime, land and air environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about the security operation, Mr Beckham said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone’s doing an incredible job, they are so amazing. The security forces are keeping everyone safe and calm and helping people enjoy the Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;
