    <title>Strategic environmental assessment about revoking the South West regional strategy: environmental report</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environmental report is a consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revocation of the South West regional planning guidance and the regional economic strategy (which together form the regional strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report succeeds the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919194318/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/revocationswrss"&gt;previous environmental report&lt;/a&gt; on the revocation of the South West regional strategy which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012. It is a stand alone document the intention of which is to provide the reader with an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of the revocation of the South West regional planning guidance and the regional economic strategy without the need to refer back to the previous environmental report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report proposes to retain the saved structure plan policy S6 from the ‘Somerset and Exmoor National Park joint structure plan’ relating to the green belt in North East Somerset. Removing this policy before the council has adopted a local plan which defines green belt boundaries could put green belt land at risk from unwanted development. This is in line with the coalition agreement to safeguard the green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to the size of the documents this publication can also be supplied on a CD-ROM. Please email requests to &lt;a href="mailto:SEAConsultation@communities.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;SEAConsultation@communities.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local authority green belt statistics for England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on the extent of the green belt in England were released under the auspices of the UK Statistics Authority on 30 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The extent of the designated green belt land in England in 2011/12 was estimated at 1,639,410 hectares, about 13% of the land area of England. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overall there has been a decrease of 130 hectares from the revised 2010-11 green belt. This is due to three authorities who have adopted new plans in which they have changed the boundaries of the green belt. This represents a decrease of less than 0.01% per cent in the total green belt area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since these statistics were first compiled for 1997, there has been an increase in the area of green belt after taking account of the redesignation of some green belt as part of the New Forest National Park in 2005.&lt;/li&gt;

The guidance can also be used by voluntary groups trying to decide what activities might suit their client base or by individuals who have yet to be convinced that food growing is really for them. The guide provides links to sources of further advice and guidance and also to more detailed information on where to go to get funding or to learn from established projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Investigation into overheating in homes</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report identifies the main gaps in the literature on overheating in homes, and recommends areas where further work might be of most value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis has been carried out on behalf of Government by a consortium led by AECOM, and supported by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and University College London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the second project output; the first being a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/overheatingliterature"&gt;Literature Review&lt;/a&gt; covering whether overheating is occurring in new dwellings, in existing dwellings and whether or not retrofitting/refurbishing existing dwellings is likely to increase the risk of overheating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;to create permitted development rights to assist change of use from existing buildings used for agricultural purposes to uses supporting rural growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to increase the thresholds for permitted development rights for change of use between B1 (business/office) and B8 (warehouse) classes and from B2 (industry) to B1 and B8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to introduce a permitted development right to allow the temporary use for two years, where the use is low impact, without the need for planning permission&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to provide C1 (hotels, boarding and guest houses) permitted development rights to convert to C3 (dwelling houses) without the need for planning permission and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to consider if any updates or amendments are needed to the existing descriptions within the use classes order&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents below describe the April 2012 changes to the Energy Performance of Buildings framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have taken steps to make it easier for consumers to save money on their fuel bills by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introducing a new look domestic Energy Performance Certificate which is consumer friendly and easy to understand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;requiring Domestic Energy Assessors to improve their skills and deliver a better customer service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;opening up access to the Energy Performance Certificate register of more than seven million Energy Performance Certificates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;amending the Regulations so the Energy Performance Certificate is provided earlier to prospective buyers and tenants, increasing the likelihood of people acting on recommendations which identify cost effective savings.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Shaping our future: implementation plan for government commitments</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2010, the previous Government published Shaping Our Future, a joint report by a Task Force comprising ministers from the Department for Environment, Food andd Rural Affairs, the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the former Office for the Third Sector (now the Office for Civil Society), and civil society groups with a strong interest in sustainable development and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four departments have now completed a joint review of the actions assigned to government in Shaping Our Future. The resulting Implementation Plan sets out proposals for taking forward these actions, helping to meet relevant commitments in the Coalition’s programme for Government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
