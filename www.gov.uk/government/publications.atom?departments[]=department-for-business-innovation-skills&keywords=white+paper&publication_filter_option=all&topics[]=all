    <title>Financial Reporting Council Reform</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FRC is already well-regarded in the UK, the EU and internationally, but we believe by tightening the focus of its activities and reforming its structural framework that it could be even more effective, increasing still further the contribution it makes to supporting the UK’s business interests. This consultation document seeks views on a set of reforms designed to build on the FRC’s strengths as well as tackle the underlying issues that currently inhibit its effectiveness. Reform is needed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reinforce the FRC’s independence from those it regulates;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve its efficiency and effectiveness; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalise and minimise the regulatory burdens on market participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not intended that reform should introduce further regulatory processes which impact significantly on business. However, to achieve our aims some proposed reforms will require changes to the legislative framework. We are committed to reducing the cost to business associated with FRC regulation and will consider carefully any opportunities for cost reduction identified through responses to this consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The future of narrative reporting: a further consultation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation seeks views on Government plans to make narrative reporting simpler, clearer and more focussed. It includes proposals to change company narrative reports to make the framework clearer for companies and easier for investors to locate the information they need. We are also reviewing the disclosure requirements that we place on companies to streamline and remove inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation also includes a number of proposals to make the reporting of executive remuneration clearer and more relevant to investors. In addition to this, the Government has published a separate &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//Consultations/executive-remuneration-discussion-paper"&gt;discussion paper seeking views on a range of issues relating to executive remuneration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="update-february-2012"&gt;Update February 2012&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our initial analysis shows support for the proposed new structure, although several organisations said that bringing the changes into force in October 2012 will not give companies enough time to adjust. We therefore propose to bring the changes into force in April 2013. We hope to publish a response to the consultation in March 2012.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="government-response"&gt;Government Response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 27 March 2012 the Government published a summary of responses and indication of the next steps. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Transforming Regulatory Enforcement: Discussion Paper</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Governmentlaunched two documents underpinning a consultation period on regulatory enforcement to seek views on the best ways to deliver improvements. Proposed changes will deliver commitments made in the Growth Review as part of a package of measures to free up business from unnecessary regulatory burdens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two consultation documents are a Discussion Paper on improving the implementation of regulation (on this page) and a&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//Consultations/future-of-local-better-regulation-office-and-primary-authority-scheme"&gt;document on the future of the Local Better Regulation Office (LBRO) and the Primary Authority (PA) scheme&lt;/a&gt;. We invite views from interested parties on both these documents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transforming-regulatory-enforcement-discussion-paper"&gt;Transforming Regulatory Enforcement: discussion paper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with its growth agenda, the Government is keen to simplify the way enforcement is carried out so as to reduce burdens on business. The discussion paper sets out some guiding principles and puts forward initial thinking on specific areas for reform. This consultationaims to inform policy development over the summer and a Government response in the autumn. We invited views from all interested persons to help us get the approach to enforcement right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation closed on 15 September 2011. Both the discussion paper and the Government response can be found in the links below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call for evidence - Review of Offender Learning</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="background-to-the-call-for-evidence"&gt;Background to the Call for Evidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offender learning is a vital element within the offender skills and employment agenda. We know that, especially in concert with the resolution of housing issues, it is a very significant factor in reducing re-offending. We need to focus on protecting the public from the costs and effects of crime. Effective and relevant offender learning provision makes offenders better able to find work, and so more of an asset to the economy, and less of a concern to the wider community, particularly through preventing people from becoming the victims of tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2006, Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment: Next Steps (“Next Steps”) set out a plan of actions to improve the effectiveness of the cross-government arrangements for delivering skills and providing the employment services, within the context of the criminal justice system, that lead to reduced re-offending. A great deal of activity has taken place since then, including the appointment of a new set of offender learning providers, the introduction of separate arrangements for providing careers information and advice, the introduction by the National Offender Management Service of arrangements to support offenders on transition back into the community, and a strategic review of employment services for offenders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review of offender learning announced by John Hayes, Minister of State for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning, will assess progress against the policy framework set out in the Next Steps document and make recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the arrangements. The review is taking full account of the earlier strategic review of employment services for offenders, and will inform the Ministry of Justice’s Autumn Green Paper setting out the proposed approach to sentencing and rehabilitation reform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Steps can be found on the Ministry of Justice website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This call for evidence is an important part of the review: we want to know what you think and why. This is your chance to tell us what we can start doing, do better or stop doing at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to hearing from you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane Bateman &lt;br&gt;
Chair of the Offender Learning Review Steering Group   &lt;/p&gt;
