    <section role="main"><header><h1>The UK system of government, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>The UK is a ‘parliamentary democracy’ with a ‘constitutional monarch’. </p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>a king or queen is the head of state</li>
  <li>a prime minister is the head of government</li>
  <li>people vote in elections for <a href="/parliament-mps" title="MPs"><abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr></a> to represent them in Parliament</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Prime Minister</h2>

<p>The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen after a general election. He or she has a number of responsibilities including:</p>

<ul>
<li>overseeing the Civil Service</li>
  <li>appointing members of the Cabinet</li>
  <li>keeping the Queen informed about the work of government</li>
</ul>
<p>The Prime Minister is based at Number 10 Downing Street in London. There’s more information on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/" title="Number 10 website">Number 10 website.</a></p>

<h2>The Cabinet</h2>

<p>This is the committee at the centre of the British political system. Cabinet ministers are appointed by the Prime Minister. </p>

<p>Most of them are heads of government departments with the title ‘Secretary of State’. Some have other titles, like the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>The Cabinet meets every Tuesday to discuss the current issues. The Prime Minister chairs the meeting and sets the agenda. </p>

<p>There are also <a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/cabinet-and-its-committees" title="Cabinet committees">Cabinet committees</a> that meet in smaller groups with other government ministers. </p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/the-coalition/the-cabinet/" title="find out more about the Cabinet">find out more about the Cabinet</a> on the Number 10 website.</p>

<h2>Parliament</h2>

<p>Parliament is based in Westminster in London. It is made up of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.</p>

<p>Its role is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>look at what the government is doing</li>
  <li>debate and pass new laws</li>
  <li>set taxes</li>
  <li>debate issues</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 650 elected <abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> in the House of Commons. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/" title="find out more about how Parliament works" rel="external">find out more about how Parliament works</a> on the Parliament website.</p>
</div>

<h2>Local government</h2>

<p>Many decisions are made and carried out locally by <a href="/understand-how-your-council-works" title="councils">councils</a>. </p>


</article><article id="how-laws-are-made"><header><h1>Part 2: How laws are made</h1>
  </header><p>Laws go through several stages before they are passed by Parliament. The House of Lords and the House of Commons work together to make them.</p>

<h2>White and green papers</h2>

<p>White papers outline proposals for new laws. Before a white paper is published, there might be a green paper, which asks for comments from the public.  </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s no requirement that a white paper or green paper has to be produced.</p>
</div>

<h2>Bills</h2>

<p>These are proposals for new laws or changes to existing ones. They get debated by Parliament and when they have been agreed, they have to be approved by the Queen before becoming law. This is called ‘Royal Assent’.</p>

<h3>Public bills</h3>

<p>These are the most common type of bill. They change the law that applies to the general public. Most public bills are proposed by government ministers. </p>

<p>If you object to a public bill you can:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.writetothem.com/" title="Write to an MP or Lord">write to your MP or a Lord</a></li>
  <li>contact the government department responsible for the bill</li>
  <li>lobby Parliament</li>
</ul>
<h2>How bills become law</h2>

<p>A bill passes through several stages in the House of Commons and the House of Lords to become law:</p>

<ul>
<li>first reading (this is where the bill is introduced without debate)</li>
  <li>second reading (general debate)</li>
  <li>committee stage (the bill is examined in detail - in the House of Commons this often takes place in a Public Bill Committee)</li>
  <li>report stage (opportunity for further amendments)</li>
  <li>third reading (the House of Lords can make amendments at this stage)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acts of Parliament</h2>

<p>An act is a bill that has been approved by the House of Lords, the House of Commons and the Queen. It can come into force:</p>

<ul>
<li>immediately</li>
  <li>at a future date</li>
  <li>in stages</li>
</ul>
<p>The relevant government department is responsible for putting the act into practice. </p>


</article><article id="government-departments-and-agencies"><header><h1>Part 3: Government departments and agencies</h1>
  </header><p>Government departments and their agencies put government policy into practice. They also advise government ministers.</p>

<p>Departments and agencies are staffed by politically impartial civil servants and funded by Parliament. </p>

<h2>Government departments</h2>

<p>Some departments, like the Ministry of Defence, cover the UK as a whole. Other departments don’t - for example, the Department for Work and Pensions covers England, Wales and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland. </p>

<p>Most departments are headed by ministers - there’s a <a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/government-and-opposition1/her-majestys-government/" title="list of government ministers and departments">list of government ministers and departments</a> on the Parliament website.</p>

<h2>Executive agencies</h2>

<p>These are part of government departments and deliver government services. They don’t set policy - this is done by the department that oversees the agency.</p>

<p>For example, Jobcentre Plus is an executive agency and part of the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>

<h2>Non-departmental public bodies (<abbr title="Non-departmental public bodies">NDPBs</abbr>)</h2>

<p>These work independently of ministers but are accountable to them. There are 2 main types of <abbr title="Non-departmental public body">NDPB</abbr>. </p>

<h3>Executive <abbr title="Non-departmental public bodies">NDPBs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>These do work for the government in specific areas. They have varying degrees of independence. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arts Council England</li>
  <li>the Environment Agency</li>
  <li>the Health and Safety Executive</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advisory <abbr title="Non-departmental public bodies">NDPBs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>These are set up by ministers to advise on particular matters. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Committee on Standards in Public Life</li>
  <li>the Low Pay Commission</li>
</ul></article><article id="the-civil-service"><header><h1>Part 4: The Civil Service</h1>
  </header><p>The Civil Service does the practical and administrative work of government. Civil servants are the politically impartial employees who work in the Civil Service.</p>

<h2>The role of civil servants</h2>

<p>Civil servants work under the minister in charge of the department where they work. If the minister changes, this doesn’t involve a change in civil service staff. </p>

<p>The roles and responsibilities of civil servants are set out in the Civil Service Code. </p>

<p>The Minister for the Civil Service is the Prime Minister. He is responsible for co-ordination and management of the Civil Service. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s more information on the <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/" title="Civil Service website" rel="external">Civil Service website.</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Where civil servants work</h3>

<p>About half of all civil servants provide services directly to the public, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>paying benefits and pensions</li>
  <li>running employment services</li>
  <li>staffing prisons</li>
  <li>issuing driving licences</li>
</ul>
<p>Around 1 in 5 civil servants are employed by the Ministry of Defence and its agencies. The rest are divided between:</p>

<ul>
<li>central administrative and policy duties</li>
  <li>support services</li>
  <li>services that support themselves financially, like the Royal Mint</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>About 80% of civil servants work outside London.</p>
</div>

<h3>Recruitment</h3>

<p>The Civil Service Commissioners make sure that recruitment to the Civil Service is based on fair and open competition. They are independent of government. </p>
