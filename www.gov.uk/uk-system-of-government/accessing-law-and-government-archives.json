Cabinet ministers are appointed by the Prime Minister. \r\n\r\nMost of them are heads of government departments with the title 'Secretary of State'. Some have other titles, like the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet meets every Tuesday to discuss the current issues.

The House of Lords and the House of Commons work together to make them.\r\n\r\n##White and green papers\r\n\r\nWhite papers outline proposals for new laws. Before a white paper is published, there might be a green paper, which asks for comments from the public.  \r\n\r\n^There's no requirement that a white paper or green paper has to be produced.^\r\n\r\n##Bills\r\n\r\nThese are proposals for new laws or changes to existing ones. They get debated by Parliament and when they have been agreed, they have to be approved by the Queen before becoming law. This is called 'Royal Assent'.\r\n\r\n###Public bills\r\n\r\nThese are the most common type of bill. They change the law that applies to the general public. Most public bills are proposed by government ministers. \r\n\r\nIf you object to a public bill you can:\r\n\r\n- [write to your MP or a Lord](http://www.writetothem.com/ \"Write to an MP or Lord\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n- contact the government department responsible for the bill\r\n- lobby Parliament\r\n\r\n\r\n##How bills become law\r\n\r\nA bill passes through several stages in the House of Commons and the House of Lords to become law:\r\n\r\n- first reading (this is where the bill is introduced without debate)\r\n- second reading (general debate)\r\n- committee stage (the bill is examined in detail - in the House of Commons this often takes place in a Public Bill Committee)\r\n- report stage (opportunity for further amendments)\r\n- third reading (the House of Lords can make amendments at this stage)\r\n\r\n##Acts of Parliament\r\n\r\nAn act is a bill that has been approved by the House of Lords, the House of Commons and the Queen. It can come into force:\r\n\r\n- immediately\r\n- at a future date\r\n- in stages\r\n\r\nThe relevant government department is responsible for putting the act into practice. \r\n\r\n","slug":"how-laws-are-made","title":"How laws are made"}},{"table":{"body":"Government departments and their agencies put government policy into practice.
