  </header><p>You can appeal to a Rent Assessment Committee if you’re a private tenant and think your rent is too high.</p>

<p>The committee is independent, and can change the rent if it’s unfair.</p>

<p>You can usually appeal when you get a letter from your landlord about a rent increase.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The committee can raise, lower or agree with the amount of rent you’re challenging.</p>
</div>

<h2>Time limits for appealing to the committee</h2>

<p>There are deadlines for appealing to the committee, depending on the type of tenancy:</p>

<ul>
<li>assured or assured shorthold tenancy: before the new rent is due to start</li>
  <li>regulated tenancy: within 28 days of the rent being decided by the rent officer</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re not sure what type of tenancy you have, check your tenancy agreement, or use <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/downloads_and_tools/tenancy_checker/" title="What type of tenancy do I have?" rel="external">Shelter’s tenancy checker.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>How the committee makes its decision</h2>

<p>The committee may ask for:</p>

<ul>
<li>more information - eg what you think the rent should be and why</li>
  <li>permission to inspect the property</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have to go to a hearing, with your landlord, to tell the committee why you think the rent is too high.</p>

<p>If you and your landlord agree, the committee can decide on the case without a hearing, using written evidence.</p>

<h2>The committee’s decision</h2>

<p>The committee will send its decision in writing, saying:</p>

<ul>
<li>what the rent should be</li>
  <li>the date the rent is payable from</li>
  <li>the reasons for their decision</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you disagree with the committee’s decision</h2>
