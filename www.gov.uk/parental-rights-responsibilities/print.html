</header><article id="what-is-parental-responsibility"><header><h1>Part 1: What is parental responsibility?</h1>
  </header><p>All mothers and <a href="/parental-rights-responsibilities/who-has-parental-responsibility" title="Who has parental responsibilities">most fathers</a> have legal rights and responsibilities as a parent - known as ‘parental responsibility’.</p>

<p>If you have parental responsibility, your most important roles are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide a home for the child</li>
  <li>protect and maintain the child</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you have parental responsibility for a child you don’t live with, you don’t necessarily have a right to contact with them - but the other parent still needs to keep you updated about their well-being and progress.</p>
</div>

<p>You’re also responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>disciplining the child</li>
  <li>choosing and providing for the child’s education</li>
  <li>agreeing to the child’s medical treatment</li>
  <li>naming the child and agreeing to any change of name</li>
  <li>looking after the child’s property</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Parents have to ensure that their child is supported financially, whether they have parental responsibility or not.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="who-has-parental-responsibility"><header><h1>Part 2: Who has parental responsibility</h1>
  </header><p>A mother automatically has <a href="/parental-rights-responsibilities/what-is-parental-responsibility" title="What is parental responsibility?">parental responsibility</a> for her child from birth.</p>

<p>A father usually has parental responsibility if he is: </p>

<ul>
<li>married to the child’s mother</li>
  <li>listed on the birth certificate (after a certain date, depending on which part of the UK the child was born in)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="/parental-rights-responsibilities/apply-for-parental-responsibility" title="Apply for parental responsibility">apply for parental responsibility</a> if you don’t automatically have it.</p>

<h2>Births registered in England and Wales</h2>

<p>If the parents of a child are married when the child is born, or if they’ve jointly adopted a child, both have parental responsibility.</p>

<p>They both keep parental responsibility if they later divorce.</p>

<h3>Unmarried parents</h3>

<p>An unmarried father can only get legal responsibility for his child in 1 of 3 ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>jointly registering the birth of the child with the mother (from 1 December 2003)</li>
  <li>getting a parental responsibility agreement with the mother</li>
  <li>getting a parental responsibility order from a court</li>
</ul>
<h2>Births registered in Scotland</h2>

<p>A father has parental responsibility if he is married to the mother when the child is conceived, or marries her at any point afterwards. </p>

<p>An unmarried father has parental responsibility if he is named on the child’s birth certificate (from 4 May 2006).</p>

<h2>Births registered in Northern Ireland</h2>
<p>A father has parental responsibility if he is married to the mother at the time of the child’s birth. </p>

<p>If a father marries the mother after the child’s birth, he has parental responsibility if he lives in Northern Ireland at the time of the marriage. </p>

<p>An unmarried father has parental responsibility if he is named, or becomes named, on the child’s birth certificate (from 15 April 2002).</p>

<h2>Births registered outside the UK</h2>

<p>If a child is born overseas and comes to live in the UK, who has parental responsibility depends on the UK country they’re now living in.</p>

<h2>Same-sex parents</h2>

<h3>Civil partners</h3>

<p>Same-sex partners who were civil partners at the time of the treatment will both have parental responsibility.</p>

<h3>Non-civil partners</h3>

<p>For same-sex partners who aren’t civil partners, the second parent can get parental responsibility by either:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/parental-rights-responsibilities/apply-for-parental-responsibility" title="Apply for parental responsibility">applying for parental responsibility</a> if a parental agreement was made</li>
  <li>becoming a civil partner of the other parent and making a parental responsibility agreement or jointly registering the birth</li>
</ul></article><article id="apply-for-parental-responsibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Apply for parental responsibility</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re not the mother, you can apply to court to get <a href="/parental-rights-responsibilities/what-is-parental-responsibility" title="What is parental responsibility?">parental responsibility</a>.</p>

<p>You need to be connected to the child, eg as their father, step-parent or second female parent.</p>

<p>More than 2 people can have parental responsibility for the same child.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Scotland has its own set of rules, covered under <a href="http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/taking-action/ordinary-cause" title="Ordinary cause procedures in the Scottish courts" rel="external">‘ordinary cause procedures’,</a> and you might want to get legal advice to help with parental responsibility cases there.</p>
</div>

<h2>Sign a parental responsibility agreement</h2>

<p>If you’re a father who wants parental responsibility and the mother agrees, fill in a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=48" title="parental responsibility agreement">parental responsibility agreement.</a></p>
