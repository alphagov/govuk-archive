  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>All children in England between the ages of 5 and 16 are entitled to a free place at a state school. </p>

<p>Most state schools have to follow the <a href="/national-curriculum" title="National curriculum">national curriculum.</a> The most common ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li>community schools: controlled by the local council and not influenced by business or religious groups</li>
  <li>foundation schools: more freedom to change the way they do things than community schools</li>
  <li>academies: run by an governing body, independent from the local council - they can follow a different curriculum</li>
  <li>grammar schools: run by the council, a foundation body or a trust - they select all or most of their pupils based on academic ability and there is often an exam to get in</li>
</ul></article><article id="specialist-schools"><header><h1>Part 2: Specialist schools</h1>
  </header><p>Specialist schools follow the <a href="/national-curriculum" title="National curriculum">national curriculum</a> but specialise in a particular area.</p>

<h2>Areas schools can specialise in</h2>

<ul>
<li>arts</li>
  <li>business and enterprise</li>
  <li>engineering</li>
  <li>humanities</li>
  <li>languages</li>
  <li>mathematics and computing</li>
  <li>music</li>
  <li>science</li>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Special Schools with secondary age students can specialise in one of the four areas of the special educational needs (<abbr title="Special educational needs">SEN</abbr>) <a href="https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DfES%200581%202001" title="SEN Code of Practice" rel="external">Code of Practice.</a></p>

</article><article id="faith-schools"><header><h1>Part 3: Faith schools</h1>
  </header><p>Faith schools can be different kinds of schools eg voluntary aided schools, free schools, academies etc but are associated with a particular religion.</p>

<p>Faith schools are mostly run like other state schools. They have to follow the national curriculum except for religious studies, where they are free to only teach about their own religion. The <a href="/schools-admissions/admissions-criteria" title="Admissions criteria">admissions criteria</a> and staffing policies may be different too, although anyone can apply for a place.</p>

</article><article id="free-schools"><header><h1>Part 4: Free schools</h1>
  </header><p>Free Schools are funded by the government but aren’t run by the local council. They have more control over how they do things.</p>

<p>They’re “all-ability” schools, so can’t use academic selection processes like a grammar school.</p>

<p>Free Schools can:</p>

<ul>
<li>set their own pay and conditions for staff</li>
  <li>change the length of school terms and the school day</li>
</ul>
<p>They don’t have to follow the <a href="/national-curriculum" title="National curriculum">national curriculum.</a></p>

<h2>Who runs free schools</h2>

<p>Free Schools are run by not-for-profit groups, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>charities</li>
  <li>universities</li>
  <li>independent schools</li>
  <li>community and faith groups</li>
  <li>teachers</li>
  <li>parents</li>
  <li>businesses</li>
</ul></article><article id="academies"><header><h1>Part 5: Academies</h1>
  </header><p>Some academies get funding from sponsors from business, faith or voluntary groups. They also get money direct from the government, not the local council. They’re run by a governing body which employs the staff.</p>

<p>Academies don’t have to follow the <a href="#" title="National curriculum">national curriculum</a> and can select pupils based on academic ability.</p>

<h2>University Technical Colleges</h2>

<p>University Technical Colleges specialise in subjects like engineering and construction - and teach these subjects along with business skills and using IT.</p>

<p>Pupils study academic subjects as well as practical subjects leading to technical qualifications. The curriculum is designed employers who also provide work experience for students.</p>

<p>University Technical Colleges are sponsored by:</p>

<ul>
<li>universities</li>
  <li>employers</li>
  <li>further education colleges</li>
</ul>
<h2>Studio schools</h2>

<p>Studio Schools are small schools - typically with around 300 pupils - delivering mainstream qualifications through project-based learning. This means working in realistic situations as well as learning academic subjects.</p>

<p>Students work with local employers and a personal coach, and follow a curriculum designed to give them the skills and qualifications they need in work, or to take up further education.</p>

</article><article id="city-technology-colleges"><header><h1>Part 6: City technology colleges</h1>
  </header><p>City technology colleges are independent schools in urban areas that are free to go to. They’re owned and funded by companies as well as central government (not the local council).</p>

<p>They have a particular emphasis on technological and practical skills.</p>

</article><article id="private-schools"><header><h1>Part 7: Private schools</h1>
  </header><p>Private schools (also known as ‘independent schools’) charge fees to attend instead of being funded by the government. Pupils don’t have to follow the <a href="/national-curriculum" title="National curriculum">national curriculum</a>.</p>

<p>All private schools must be registered with the government and are inspected regularly.</p>
