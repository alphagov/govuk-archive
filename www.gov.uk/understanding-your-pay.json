You can include overtime and bonuses. There are special calculations for bonuses.\r\n\r\n##Quarterly bonuses\r\n\r\nIf you get a quarterly bonus you can include a proportion of it in your calculations. Here's what to do:\r\n\r\ns1. Divide the amount by 13 (the number of weeks in a quarter of a year).\r\ns2. Multiply this figure by 12 (the number of weeks your pay is averaged across). \r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nIf you get a quarterly bonus of \u00a3260:\r\n\r\n- divide \u00a3260 by 13 weeks = \u00a320\r\n- multiply \u00a320 by 12 weeks = \u00a3240\r\n\r\nYou can include a bonus of \u00a3240 as part of your 12-week total.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n##Annual bonuses\r\n\r\nIf you get an annual bonus here's what you need to do.\r\n\r\ns1. Divide the amount by 52 (the number of weeks in a year).\r\ns2. Multiply this by 12.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nIf you get an annual bonus of \u00a35,200:\r\n\r\n- divide \u00a35,200 by 52 weeks = \u00a3100 per week\r\n- multiply \u00a3100 by 12 weeks = \u00a31,200\r\n\r\nYou can include a bonus of \u00a31,200 as part of your 12-week total.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\nOnce you've worked out your total pay for the 12-week period, work out the average hourly rate by dividing the total by the number of hours you worked in the 12-week period. \r\n\r\nTo work out your weekly wage, multiply your hourly rate by the average number of hours you worked each week in the 12-week period.\r\n\r\n##If you do shift or rota work\r\n\r\nYour week\u2019s pay will be the average number of hours you work at an average pay rate over a 12-week period.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nYour pay is \u00a36 per hour and you work 3, 9-hour shifts, then you have 3 days off. \r\n\r\nOn weekends you're paid \u00a39 per hour. At the start of the 12-week period, your first day at work is a Monday. Here's how you work out your pay.\r\n\r\ns1. Work out how many hours you did over the 12-week period (42, 9-hour shifts = 378 hours).\r\ns2. Divide this by 12 to work out your average weekly hours: 378 divided by 12 = 31.5 hours.\r\ns3. Calculate your pay for the weekday shifts. You'd have worked 30 weekday 9-hour shifts at \u00a36 per hour. 30 shifts x 9 hours = 270 hours. Multiply this by \u00a36 to get the total you were paid for your weekday shifts: \u00a31620. \r\ns4. Divide \u00a31620 by 12 to get the weekly figure: \u00a3135.\r\ns5. Calculate your pay for weekends. You'd have worked 12 weekend 9-hour shifts at \u00a39 per hour. 12 shifts x 9 hours = 108 hours. Multiply this by \u00a39 to get the weekend total: \u00a3972 \r\ns6. Divide this by 12 to get the weekly figure: \u00a381 per week.\r\ns7. Add the weekday and weekend figures together: \u00a3135 + \u00a381 = \u00a3216.
