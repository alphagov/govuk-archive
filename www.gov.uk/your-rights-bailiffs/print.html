  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="what-to-do-when-a-bailiff-visits"><header><h1>Part 1: What to do when a bailiff visits</h1>
  </header><p>A bailiff may visit your home if you don’t pay your debts - eg a Council Tax bill, parking fine, court fine or county court judgment.</p>

<p>This will happen if you ignore reminder and warning letters, saying that bailiffs will be used.</p>

<p>You can offer to pay some of the money you owe to stop bailiffs from visiting.</p>

<h2>Dealing with bailiffs on your doorstep</h2>

<p>You don’t have to open your front door to a bailiff or let them in.</p>

<p>Bailiffs can usually only come into your home if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you leave a door or window open</li>
  <li>you invite them in</li>
</ul>
<p>They are not normally allowed to force their way into your home - eg by pushing past you, or putting their foot in the door. </p>

<p>If they try this, you can call the police.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Bailiffs are allowed to force their way into your home to collect unpaid criminal fines, Income Tax or VAT, but only as a last resort.</p>
</div>

<h2>What to ask a bailiff</h2>

<p>Before you pay a bailiff, or let them in to take your things, ask to see proof of their identity - eg a copy of their bailiff certificate.</p>

<p>Also ask for one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a copy of the court order saying you owe the money</li>
  <li>a copy of their ‘authorisation’ (permission) to take your things</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the dates on the documents to see if they’re still valid.</p>

<h2>Paying a bailiff</h2>

<p>You may want to pay the bailiff some, or all of the money you owe.</p>

<p>You can pay them on the doorstep - you don’t have to invite them into your home.</p>

<p>Make sure you get a receipt, to prove you’ve paid.</p>

<h2>If you can’t pay</h2>

<p>If you can’t pay anything right away, you can speak to the bailiff about repayments, or:</p>

<ul>
<li>tell the bailiff you’ll pay the money back directly to the company or organisation you owe it to</li>
  <li>write to this company or organisation, and offer to pay what you can afford</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t make an offer to pay, you could be taken back to court.</p>

<h2>What bailiffs can and can’t take</h2>

<p>If you let a bailiff into your home, they are allowed to take some of your belongings.</p>

<p>Bailiffs can’t take:</p>

<ul>
<li>things you need - eg your clothes, cooker, fridge, furniture or work tools</li>
  <li>someone else’s belongings - eg your partner’s computer</li>
</ul>
<p>They can take luxury items - eg a TV or games console.</p>

<p>They can also take things from outside your home - eg your car or garden equipment.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The bailiff will sell the items they take to pay the debt and cover their fees.</p>
</div>

<h2>What bailiffs can charge</h2>

<p>Bailiffs can charge you for visits to your home - this will be added to what you owe.</p>

<p>They can also charge you fees for coming into your home and taking your belongings.</p>

<p>You can ask for a detailed breakdown of their charges.</p>

<p>If you think they’re charging too much or for something they haven’t done, you can challenge them and complain.</p>

</article><article id="how-to-complain-about-a-bailiff"><header><h1>Part 2: How to complain about a bailiff</h1>
  </header><p>You can complain about a bailiff if you think they have broken the rules, eg if they:</p>

<ul>
<li>threaten or harass you</li>
  <li>try to break into your home</li>
  <li>try to charge you unfair fees</li>
  <li>take goods belonging to someone else</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to complain to different people, depending on whether the bailiff is a:</p>

<ul>
<li>private bailiff, working for a private company</li>
  <li>county court bailiff or civilian enforcement officer, working directly for the court</li>
</ul>
<h2>Complain about a private bailiff</h2>

<p>Most bailiffs work for private companies, even if they’re collecting money for the council or the government.</p>

<p>To complain about a private bailiff, write to the bailiff’s company.</p>

<p>If you don’t get a response from the company, write to the organisation you owe the money to - eg the council.</p>

<p>Keep a copy of your complaint letter.</p>

<h3>Complain to a trade organisation</h3>

<p>You may also be able to complain to the bailiff’s trade association.</p>

<p>Check the membership lists on the trade associations’ websites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.civea.co.uk/member-list.htm" title="Civil Enforcement Association - member list">Civil Enforcement Association - member list</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.hceoa.org.uk/members/authorised-members-directory.html" title="High Court Enforcement Officers Association - directory">High Court Enforcement Officers Association - directory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the bailiff is a member, write to the trade association to complain. Follow the complaints procedure on the association’s website.</p>

<h2>Complain about a county court bailiff or civilian enforcement officer</h2>

<p>To complain about a county court bailiff or civilian enforcement officer, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetLeaflet.do?court_leaflets_id=254" title="complaint form (EX343A)">complaint form EX343A.</a></p>

<p>Post the form to the court - you can find the address using <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/" title="court finder">court finder.</a></p>
