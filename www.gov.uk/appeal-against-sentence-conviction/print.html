  </header><p>If you pleaded not guilty you can appeal against your conviction and/or sentence.</p>

<p>If you pleaded guilty you can normally only appeal your sentence.</p>

<p>You should appeal within 21 days of the date you were sentenced.</p>

<p>Your appeal will be heard by the Crown Court.</p>

<h2>Get an appeal application form</h2>

<p>The appeal form comes with guidance notes - including when you must appeal by.</p>

</div>

<p>Send the form to the magistrates’ court where the original trial took place.</p>

<h2>The court hearing</h2>

<p>A few weeks before the hearing you’ll get a letter telling you where and when it is. This is normally your nearest Crown Court.</p>

<p>Appeal hearings usually last between 1 and 3 days.</p>

<h2>The appeal decision</h2>

<p>If you win your appeal against your conviction your sentence will no longer apply.</p>

<p>If you win your appeal against your sentence it will be reduced.</p>

<p>You may get any legal costs paid back (eg a solicitor’s fee) and you may be able to get compensation.</p>

<p>Use the form below to apply for compensation:</p>

  </header><p>If you pleaded guilty at your trial, you can normally only appeal against your sentence.</p>

<p>If you pleaded not guilty at your trial, you can appeal against your conviction and/or your sentence.</p>

<p>You can normally only appeal if:</p>

<ul>
<li>something went ‘wrong’ at the trial - eg if an important court procedure was not followed properly</li>
  <li>there’s new evidence - like a witness who wasn’t at the original trial (this is for appeals against a conviction only)</li>
</ul>

<p>Appealing a Crown Court verdict is complicated - you should get legal advice.</p>

<h2>The appeal process</h2>

<p>You need permission to appeal from the Criminal Appeal Office.</p>

<p>You should complete Form NG (Notice and Grounds). It comes with guidance notes.</p>

</div>

<h2>When you must appeal</h2>

<p>For a conviction, you must appeal within 28 days of the date of your conviction - even if you were sentenced at a later date.</p>

<p>If you only want to appeal against your sentence, the 28-day period starts from the date you were sentenced.</p>

<h2>If you get permission to appeal</h2>

<p>If permission is granted, your case will be reviewed by the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>A few weeks before the hearing you’ll get a letter telling you where and when it is.</p>

<h2>If you don’t get permission to appeal</h2>

<p>You will get a letter telling you that you can’t appeal. </p>

<p>You have the right to ‘renew’ your application and ask a ‘full court’ of 3 judges to give you permission. The letter tells you how to do this.</p>

<p>If you’re not given permission to appeal by the full court, you can contact the <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/criminal-cases-review-commission/forms-and-how-to-apply" title="Criminal Cases Review Commission. ">Criminal Cases Review Commission.</a></p>
