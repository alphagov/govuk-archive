  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>Assets can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>computers</li>
  <li>televisions</li>
  <li>bicycles</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p><a href="/expenses-and-benefits-company-cars" title="Company cars">Cars</a>, <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-company-vans" title="vans">vans</a> and <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-accommodation" title="living accommodation">living accommodation</a> aren’t covered in this guide - these are reported separately.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report anything to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) or pay National Insurance on the asset if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the employee who uses it earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="Calculate earnings 'at a rate'">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year</li>
  <li>it’s office equipment provided just for business use</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the asset isn’t <a href="/expenses-benefits-assets-available-to-employee/whats-exempt" title="exempt assets">exempt</a>, you must report it to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) and may have to pay National Insurance (<abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr>) on it.</p>

<h2>Assets for business use only</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can apply for a <a href="/apply-for-a-dispensation" title="dispensation">dispensation</a>, which means you won’t have to include assets for business use on your end-of-year reports.</p>
</div>

<p>If your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="Calculate earnings 'at a rate'">at a rate</a> of more than £8,500 a year, or they’re a director, you’ll have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>report on form P11D, section L</li>
  <li>pay nothing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assets for personal and business use</h2>

<p>If your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="Calculate earnings 'at a rate'">at a rate</a> of more than £8,500 a year, or they’re a director, you’ll have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>report on form P11D, section L</li>
  <li>pay Class 1A <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> on the value of the benefit</li>
</ul></article><article id="work-out-the-value"><header><h1>Part 4: Work out the value</h1>
  </header><p>There are 2 steps to working out how much your asset is worth:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Take the greater of either the asset’s annual value or the rental or hire charges you pay for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add anything else you’ve spent on the asset during the year, eg running costs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The asset’s annual value is 20% of its market value when you first provided it as an employee benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>You should reduce the value proportionately if either of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
<li>you made the asset available to more than one employee during the year</li>
  <li>you used the asset directly for your business during the year in some other way than making it available to your employee</li>
</ul></article><article id="technical-guidance"><header><h1>Part 5: Technical guidance</h1>
