</header><article id="what-corrections-can-be-made"><header><h1>Part 1: What corrections can be made</h1>
  </header><p>You can’t change a death certificate once it’s been issued, but you can apply to get a note added to the original entry in the death register. </p>

<p>You can then get an updated certificate issued that shows this note.</p>

<p>Corrections to a death registration can only be made when the information is wrong (eg a mistake in spelling a person’s name).</p>

<h2>Who to apply to</h2>
<p>You can either apply for a correction to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>the register office where the death was registered - for minor mistakes in a date of death, birthplace or address </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the General Register Office (<abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>) - for mistakes involving things like names </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re unsure who to apply to, contact the relevant <a href="/register-offices" title="Find your register office">register office</a> or the <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>There is a different procedure for correcting a death registration after a coroner’s inquest - contact the relevant <a href="/register-offices" title="Find your register office">register office</a> to find out what to do.</p>
</div>

<h2>What the correction looks like</h2>
<p>The original information will always be shown in the death register. After the correction has been authorised, a note will be added to the margin of the register. This will explain what the correct information is and when the correction was made. </p>

<p>If you apply for a new death certificate, the note containing the correct information will be in the margin.</p>


</article><article id="who-can-apply"><header><h1>Part 2: Who can apply</h1>
  </header><p>Anyone can apply to correct a death entry. </p>

<p>However, the General Register Office (<abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>) will usually need a letter from the person who gave information for the death to be registered before considering a correction.  </p>


</article><article id="how-to-apply"><header><h1>Part 3: How to apply</h1>
  </header><h2>Applying to the General Register Office (<abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>)</h2>

<p>If you’re applying to <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>, you must fill in the following application form.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_200730.pdf" title="Application form to correct details on a death registration (PDF, 24KB)" rel="external">Download ‘Application form to correct details on a death registration’ (PDF, 24KB)</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Applying to your local register office</h2>

<p>If the correction is for a minor error (date of death, birthplace or address), contact the register office for more information and an appointment.  </p>

<h2>Proving the registration is wrong</h2>

<p>You’ll need to show that the information given at the time of the registration was wrong. You must send in documents with your application that show what the correct information should have been. These documents should be valid or dated around the time of the death.</p>

<p>Documents you can send in include a:</p>

<ul>
<li>passport</li>
  <li>photocard driving licence</li>
  <li>bank, building society or credit card statement</li>
  <li>letter from a hospital or doctor</li>
  <li>letter from a government department</li>
  <li>utility bill</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you can’t send in proof, corrections can’t be made.</p>
</div>

<h2>Sending in certified documents</h2>
<p>You should only send in documents that have been <a href="/certifying-a-document" title="Certifying a document">certified</a> as true copies of the original.</p>

<h2>Witnessing the correction</h2>
<p>If the correction is being made at your register office, you need to arrange an appointment with them. When you go in you’ll witness the correction and sign the note made in the death register.</p>

<p>If you’re applying to the <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr> to make the correction, you can say on the application form if you want to witness the correction. </p>

<h3>Statutory declaration</h3>

<p>If you’re applying to correct a serious mistake (eg in the name of a person), the <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr> may ask you to make a ‘statutory declaration’. <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr> will give you more advice about this if it is necessary.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You may have to pay a fee for a statutory declaration.</p>
</div>

<h2>How much it costs</h2>

<p>It’s free to make a correction to the register. </p>
