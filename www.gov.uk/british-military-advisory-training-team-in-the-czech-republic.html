<p>British Military Advisory Training Team based in the Czech Republic (<abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr>) (CZ) delivers an important part of an agreed Security Cooperation Programme by promoting military cooperation and understanding, building trust and assisting with the development of professional and efficient armed forces under civil democratic control. <abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> particularly seeks to assist by increasing the capabilities of partner countries to participate in multinational Peace Support Operations (<abbr title="Peace Support Operations">PSO</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> offers a range of bespoke training drawn from the following core business:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Instructor Training Courses</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Peace Support Operations">PSO</abbr> Instructor Training Courses</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Peace Support Operations">PSO</abbr> mission pre-deployment training</li>
  <li>Design of Peace keeping training and programmes</li>
  <li>Junior Command and Leadership training</li>
  <li>Live firing, either marksmanship or tactical</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-country-training-team-ictt">In Country Training Team (<abbr title="In Country Training Team">ICTT</abbr>)</h2>

<p>‘In Country Training Team’ (<abbr title="In Country Training Team">ICTT</abbr>) tasks are a key part of the Unit’s mandate and some 50% of our time and manpower resources are dedicated to this vital outreach work. The reason is straightforward, the UK’s armed forces and, increasingly, our Czech counterparts, have a wealth of experience to offer countries currently engaged in the transition from conscript-based to truly professional, democratically accountable armies. The British experience is considerable, spanning many decades of expeditionary operations and more recently on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Czech Republic’s recent experience of reshaping its forces to meet the needs of its responsibilities in the 21st Century, combined with lessons learned in deploying alongside its allies, provides another perspective with many valuable lessons for other partner countries at whatever stage has been reached in the evolution of their respective military capabilities.</p>

<p>A typical <abbr title="In Country Training Team">ICTT</abbr> comprises an officer/ warrant officer as Team Leader and 2 to 5 senior non-commissioned officers as instructors. All will have recent operational experience or have come from employment in key training posts. Wherever possible this team is reinforced with <abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> trained instructors serving with the host nation and normally the target audience will be potential instructors. Ideally the host nation instructors will have attended a <abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> course at Vyškov although frequently this requirement is met by their having been trained on an earlier <abbr title="In Country Training Team">ICTT</abbr>. ‘Train the Trainer’ is the key to an effective cascade of best practice and that is what <abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> instructors strive to achieve.</p>

<p>2011 <abbr title="In Country Training Teams">ICTTs</abbr> were conducted in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Czech Republic x 2 deployments (Operational Mentor and Liaison Team [<abbr title="Operational Mentor and Liaison Team">OMLT</abbr>] Training), Kosovo, Romania x 3 deployments, Morocco and Ukraine</li>
</ul>
<p>To date, 2012 <abbr title="In Country Training Teams">ICTTs</abbr> have been conducted in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bosnia &amp; Herzogovina, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, Romania, Georgia and Czech Republic x 2 deployments (<abbr title="Operational Mentor and Liaison Team">OMLT</abbr> and provincial reconstruction teams [<abbr title="provincial reconstruction teams">PRT</abbr>] Training)</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> maintains a busy programme for the remainder of 2012/13 and looks forward to continuing to make this contribution, which is ultimately intended to facilitate meaningful engagement in current Peace Support Operations.</p>

<h2 id="bmatt-cz">
<abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> (CZ)</h2>

<p>This combined British and Czech team delivers an important part of the United Kingdom’s Security Co-operation Programme.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> is located at Vyškov, within the Military Academy of the Czech Armed Forces, and has been in existence since 2000. Today, <abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> is very much a joint UK/Czech organisation, composed of 17 UK and 5 Czech military personnel and with considerable training and administrative support provided by the Czech Army. <abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> personnel are all high quality instructors with a wealth of operational experience from today’s major theatres of conflict.</p>

<p>The Unit’s Mission Statement is:</p>

<p>“To provide military training courses, training assistance and advice to Partner Countries, in order to further develop their professional armed forces and their capabilities to participate in multinational Peace Support Operations.”</p>

<p>Training is delivered in two ways:</p>

<p>First, throughout the year at Vyškov, <abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> conducts a series of instructor training and personal development courses. This is multinational training, conducted in English, with a typical instructor training course being 6 weeks in duration and consisting of 30 students from between 11-15 countries. Training for Peace Support Operations (<abbr title="Peace Support Operations">PSO</abbr>) is a core theme, with courses to train instructors to teach practical <abbr title="Peace Support Operations">PSO</abbr> skills and to train staff in key planning procedures within a multinational HQ. Some 300 officers, warrant officers and sergeants are trained at Vyškov each year.</p>

<p>Second, each year <abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr> deploys up to 8 small teams known as In-Country Training Teams, usually for 3-4 weeks, to selected countries to provide a range of training assistance and advice. Again, <abbr title="Peace Support Operations">PSO</abbr> is a core theme, with instructor training courses and assistance with the planning, conduct or mentoring of the delivery of operational pre-deployment training making up the majority of these tasks.</p>

<p>The combined impact of this training is to help partner countries to improve their indigenous training capabilities, especially in respect of <abbr title="Peace Support Operations">PSO</abbr> training. Currently, there are some 30 partner countries - from Central Asia, the Caucasus, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Baltic and North Africa - who benefit from the training delivered by <abbr title="British Military Advisory Training Team">BMATT</abbr>.</p>

<p>All training is provided free of costs, less a small food and accommodation charge for students from <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr> countries attending Vyškov courses.</p>
