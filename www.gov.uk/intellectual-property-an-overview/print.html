  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="what-is-intellectual-property"><header><h1>Part 1: What is intellectual property?</h1>
  </header><p>Intellectual property is something you create that’s unique. </p>

<p>It includes copyright, patents and trademarks, and can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>something you invent, like a new product</li>
  <li>a product’s design or appearance</li>
  <li>a brand or logo</li>
  <li>written work, like content on a website or in a brochure</li>
  <li>artistic work, like photography or illustrations</li>
  <li>film recordings or musical compositions</li>
  <li>computer software</li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t protect an idea - but you can often protect what you do with it. </p>

<p>For example, you can’t protect an idea for a book. But if you write it, you can protect the words you’ve written.</p>

<h2>Who owns intellectual property</h2>

<p>If you create something, you or your business usually own the intellectual property.</p>

<p>If someone you employ or subcontract creates something for you, their contract with you should clarify who owns the intellectual property.</p>

<h2>Protecting your intellectual property rights</h2>

<p>Protecting your intellectual property allows you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>stop others using what you’ve created without your permission</li>
  <li>charge others for the right to use what you’ve created</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting the right type of protection</h3>

<p>The type of protection you need depends on what you’ve created. For example, artistic works are protected by copyright, while inventions are protected by patents.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can use more than one type of protection for the same product.</p>
</div>

<p>For example, you can patent your product and register its name as a trademark.</p>

<p>You can check which type of intellectual property protection best suits you and how to make the most of it by using the Intellectual Property Office’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/whyuse/business/iphealthcheck.htm" title="IPO IP Healthcheck tool">healthcheck.</a></p>

</article><article id="copyright"><header><h1>Part 2: Copyright</h1>
  </header><p>Copyright protects original:</p>

<ul>
<li>literary and written work, like published novels or content on websites</li>
  <li>dramatic, musical and artistic works and their performances</li>
  <li>television, film, sound and music recordings</li>
  <li>computer software</li>
  <li>illustration and photography</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You automatically get copyright protection when you create something original – you don’t need to register.</p>
</div>

<p>But before making your work public, you should mark it with:</p>

<ul>
<li>the copyright symbol (©)</li>
  <li>the copyright holder’s name</li>
  <li>the year the work was created</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives you more protection, as it shows others that it’s covered by copyright and who owns it.</p>

<h3>When your work is protected by copyright</h3>

<p>To be protected by copyright, your work must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be original (you’ll need to be able to prove that you’ve made a significant creative contribution to it)</li>
  <li>physically exist (it can’t be just an idea)</li>
</ul>
<p>Copyright in the UK lasts for the rest of the creator’s life plus 70 years. </p>

<h3>Copyright overseas</h3>

<p>UK copyright is automatically valid in countries who have <a href="http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?treaty_id=15%20Title" title="Signatories to the Berne Convention on copyright" rel="external">signed the Berne Convention.</a></p>

<p>How long copyright lasts in these countries varies, but it’s usually a minimum of 50 years (25 years for photographs).</p>

</article><article id="design-right"><header><h1>Part 3: Design right</h1>
  </header><p>Design right automatically protects the physical shape of something original that you design.</p>

<p>For example, if you design a vase with a unique shape, the design is automatically protected in the UK by design right.</p>

<p>Your design must be unique - the law says it can’t be ‘commonplace, everyday or ordinary’.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Design right doesn’t cover any two-dimensional elements of a design, eg a pattern on a product’s surface.</p>
</div>

<h3>How long design right protection lasts</h3>

<p>Design right protects your design in the UK until the earlier of:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 years after the design was first created</li>
  <li>10 years after the design was first marketed and sold</li>
</ul>
<h3>Automatic protection for designs in the EU</h3>

<p>A unique design you create in the UK will automatically become an ‘unregistered community design’. </p>

<p>Unregistered community designs are protected across the EU for up to 3 years after you make the design public. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Unregistered community design also protects two-dimensional elements to a design, like a decorative pattern on an object.</p>
</div>

<h2>Getting stronger protection for your designs</h2>

<p>If someone uses your design without permission, defending design right and unregistered community design can be difficult. You need to prove:</p>

<ul>
<li>your work is original</li>
  <li>you created it first</li>
  <li>any copying was deliberate</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can prove all these things, you can try to <a href="/intellectual-property-an-overview/disputes-about-intellectual-property" title="Disputes about intellectual property">stop or reach an agreement</a> with whoever’s using your design without permission.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can get stronger protection for your design by <a href="/intellectual-property-an-overview/registered-designs" title="Registering your design">registering it</a>.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="patents"><header><h1>Part 4: Patents</h1>
  </header><p>You can protect something you’ve invented by patenting it. A patent registers your invention and stops anyone making, using or selling it without your permission.</p>

<h2>What you can and can’t patent</h2>

<p>Your invention has to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>new</li>
  <li>genuinely inventive (not just an obvious modification to something that already exists)</li>
  <li>something that can be physically made or used</li>
</ul>
<p>Things you can’t patent include:</p>

<ul>
<li>literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works</li>
  <li>schemes, rules or methods (including medical treatment methods)</li>
  <li>anything that’s solely an idea (eg a way of thinking, a scientific or mathematical discovery)</li>
  <li>new types of plants, seeds or animals</li>
</ul>
<h2>Registering a patent in the UK</h2>

<p>Patent registrations can be complicated and are often handled by <a rel="external" href="http://www.cipa.org.uk/" title="The Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys">patent attorneys.</a> It can take more than 4 years for a patent to be granted. </p>

<p>You can do it yourself - but mistakes in your application could slow it down or mean you have to reapply. </p>

<p>A patent attorney can be expensive, but if you’re not sure about the process, using one may save you money in the long term.</p>

<p>These are the basic steps to apply for a patent:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-applying/p-before.htm" title="Before you apply" rel="external">Prepare your patent application</a> including a written description of your invention and legal statements that define its distinctive technical features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search for <a href="/search-for-patent" title="Search for a patent">similar or identical patents</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File your <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-applying/p-apply.htm" title="Apply for a patent" rel="external">application.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>) will check your application and do its own search to make sure your invention doesn’t already exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your patent application is published by the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> to give other people the chance to object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your application is granted or refused.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After your patent has been granted, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/patent/p-manage/p-useenforce.htm/" title="Using and defending a patent">licence it to other people or defend it against infringements.</a></p>

<h2>How long a patent lasts</h2>

<p>A patent can last for 20 years from the date you apply for it. After you’ve held a patent for 4 years, you must <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-renew.htm" title="Renewing your patent">renew it every year</a> if you want to keep it.</p>

<h2>Getting patents overseas</h2>

<p>A patent only protects your invention in the country where the patent is registered.</p>

<p>You can apply for patents in the EU or other countries around the world <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-manage/p-abroad/p-worldwide.htm" title="Patent protection worldwide">through the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>.</a></p>


</article><article id="trademarks"><header><h1>Part 5: Trademarks</h1>
  </header><p>A trademark is a something that makes your brand recognisable, like a logo or a sound. </p>

<p>Registering a trademark lets you stop other people from using it without your permission.</p>

<p>To register a trademark, it must be clearly different from any trademarks already registered for the same type of products or services. </p>

<p>A trademark registration lasts 10 years and is only valid in the country of registration. You can renew it every 10 years.</p>

<h2>Company and domain names</h2>

<p>Company names and domain names aren’t automatically trademarks. You register:</p>

<ul>
<li>company names with <a rel="external" href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/" title="Companies House">Companies House</a>
</li>
  <li>domain names with domain name registrars</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve done that, you may be able to register company or domain names as trademarks.</p>

<h2>Registering a trademark in the UK</h2>

<p>These are the basic steps:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Check that your brand <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-about/t-whatis.htm/" title="What is a trademark (or brand)?" rel="external">qualifies as a trademark</a> - you can’t change it after it’s registered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find out if an identical or similar trademark already exists - it’s your responsibility to do a thorough <a href="/search-for-trademark" title="Search for a trademark">search</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/register-a-trademark" title="Register a trademark">Register</a> your trademark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>) will check your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your application will be made public to give other people the chance to oppose it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> grants or refuses your trademark application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-about/t-advice/t-advice-prof.htm/" title="Professional advice">trademark attorney</a> can help with searches and registrations. </p>

<p>After your trademark is granted it will be published in the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> database and you’ll get a certificate. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> doesn’t police trademark infringement. If someone is using your trademark without permission, you’ll need to <a href="/intellectual-property-an-overview/disputes-about-intellectual-property" title="Disputes about intellectual property">get them to stop</a>.</p>

<h2>Registering trademarks overseas</h2>

<p>There are different rules for <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-manage/t-abroad.htm/" title="European and International trademarks">EU and international trademarks</a></p>


</article><article id="registered-designs"><header><h1>Part 6: Registered designs</h1>
  </header><p>Registering your design can give you more protection than <a href="/intellectual-property-an-overview/design-right" title="Design right">design right</a>.</p>

<p>Registering a design:</p>

<ul>
<li>protects all aspects of your design (for example, both your product’s distinctive shape and its decoration)</li>
  <li>gives you exclusive rights to use it for up to 25 years</li>
</ul>
<p>You can register the physical shape, configuration or decoration of a product you’ve designed.</p>

<h2>When you can register a design</h2>

<p>To register your design, it must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be new</li>
  <li>not be offensive</li>
  <li>not make use of protected emblems or national flags (for example, the Olympic rings or the Union Flag)</li>
  <li>not be an invention or how a product works - you need a patent for this</li>
</ul>
<h2>Registering a design in the UK</h2>

<p>These are the steps to register a design in the UK:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Check the Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>) database of <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/design/d-os/d-find.htm" title="Find designs" rel="external">UK-registered designs</a> to see if your design is unique - or you can ask the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> to <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/design/d-applying/d-before/d-alreadyreg.htm" title="Is your design already registered?" rel="external">do it for you</a> for £25.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the design is unique, you can <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/design/d-applying/d-apply.htm" title="How to apply: Registering your Design" rel="external">apply to the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr></a> to register your design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> will examine your application within a month and if there are no objections, your design will be registered within 3 months.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Applying to register a design costs £60 for the first design and £40 for any other design in the same application.</p>
</div>

<h2>Registering a design in the EU</h2>

<p>To register a design across the EU, you can <a rel="external" href="http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/RCD/regProcess/regProcess.en.do" title="OHIM: The registration process">apply to the Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market.</a> </p>

<p>A design registered across the EU is called a registered community design. Applying for one registered community design costs €350.</p>

<p>You can also apply for a registered community design <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/design/d-manage/d-abroad/d-eu.htm/" title="Design protection in Europe">through the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr></a> - you’ll have to pay an additional handling fee of £15.</p>

<h2>Registering a design outside the EU</h2>

<p>You can register designs outside the EU. </p>

<p>If the country you want to register the design in has signed <a rel="external" href="http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/documents/pdf/hague.pdf" title="Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs">the Hague Agreement</a> you can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>apply for registration in that country only</li>
  <li>make one application for all countries who have signed the agreement</li>
</ul>
<p>You must apply through the <a rel="external" href="http://www.wipo.int/hague/en/" title="Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs">World Intellectual Property Organisation.</a> </p>

<p>If the country hasn’t signed the Hague Agreement, apply to the government department responsible for intellectual property in that country.</p>


</article><article id="disputes-about-intellectual-property"><header><h1>Part 7: Disputes about intellectual property</h1>
  </header><p>If you think someone’s used your intellectual property without permission (sometimes known as ‘infringing your intellectual property rights’), you should either:</p>

<ul>
<li>stop them </li>
  <li>make a commercial agreement so they can use it</li>
</ul>
<h3>Request in writing that they stop</h3>

<p>You can write to them yourself or you can get a solicitor or specialist intellectual property lawyer to do it for you.</p>

<p>You can use members of the:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.cipa.org.uk/" title="CIPA">Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.itma.org.uk/" title="ITMA">Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys</a></li>

  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.lawsoc-ni.org/" title="The Law Society of Northern Ireland">Law Society of Northern Ireland</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Try mediation or arbitration</h3>

<p>If your letter doesn’t work, mediation or arbitration should be your next step. You may 
be able to reach an agreement, or a licensing deal.</p>

<p>You can use the Intellectual Property Office’s (<abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>) <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/d-mediation-ourservice.htm/" title="Our mediation service">mediation service</a> wherever you are in the UK.</p>

<p>Or you can find accredited mediators in your country from:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.civilmediation.justice.gov.uk/" title="Find a Civil Mediation provider">Civil Mediation Council (England and Wales)</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.scottishmediation.org.uk/" title="Scottish Mediation Network">Scottish Mediation Network</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.mediationnorthernireland.org/" title="Mediation Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland Mediation</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Mediation usually costs around £1,000 per day.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you can’t reach agreement</h2>

<p>You can take <a href="/intellectual-property-an-overview/legal-action-about-intellectual-property" title="Legal action about intellectual property">legal action</a>.</p>


</article><article id="legal-action-about-intellectual-property"><header><h1>Part 8: Legal action about intellectual property</h1>
  </header><p>The Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>) can legally resolve some intellectual property disputes if you can’t <a href="/intellectual-property-an-overview/disputes-about-intellectual-property" title="Disputes about intellectual property">do it another way</a>. It can make final decisions on disputes about:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-dispute/p-hearing/p-interpartes/p-fileproceed.htm" title="How to file proceedings with us">patents</a> </li>

</ul>
<h2>Taking court action</h2>

<p>Going to court should be your last option - you should try to <a href="/intellectual-property-an-overview/disputes-about-intellectual-property" title="Disputes about intellectual property">get an agreement</a> first.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>A court case about intellectual property can be extremely expensive, even if you win.</p>
</div>

<p>In England and Wales, the maximum you can get for cases you win in the Patents Court are:</p>

<ul>
<li>£500,000 for damages</li>
  <li>£50,000 for legal costs</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no limits in Scotland or Northern Ireland, or if any case in the UK goes to the High Court.</p>

<p>This means that even if you win your case, you could pay more in legal fees than you get back.</p>

<p>If you really need to take your case to court, you should use a specialist legal adviser, like members of the:</p>
