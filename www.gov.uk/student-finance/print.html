</article><article id="who-qualifies"><header><h1>Part 5: Who qualifies</h1>
  </header><p>Whether you qualify for student finance depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>your nationality or residency status</li>
  <li>your university or college</li>
  <li>your course </li>
  <li>if you’ve studied before </li>
  <li>your age </li>
</ul>
<h2>Nationality or residency status</h2>

<p>You can only apply if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re a UK national or have ‘settled status’ (no restrictions on how
long you can stay)</li>
  <li>you normally live in England</li>
  <li>you’ve been living in the UK for 3 years before starting your course</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be eligible if your residency status is one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national, or family member of one</li>
  <li>refugee</li>
  <li>humanitarian protection (as a result of a failed application for asylum)</li>
  <li>migrant worker</li>
  <li>child of a Swiss national</li>
  <li>child of a Turkish worker</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your course</h2>

<p>This must be in the UK and one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a first degree, eg BA, BSc or BEd</li>
  <li>a Foundation Degree</li>
  <li>a Certificate of Higher Education</li>

  <li>a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE)</li>
  <li>Initial Teacher Training</li>
  <li>further training of youth and community workers</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Check with your university or college that your course is recognised.</p>
</div>

<h2>You studied before</h2>

<p>Generally, you’ll only get student finance if you’re doing your first higher
education qualification. However, you may still get it if, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>you change course</li>
  <li>you leave your course but decide to start again</li>
  <li>you’re ‘topping up’ a higher education qualification, eg you’ve finished an HNC, HND or foundation degree and now want to
do an honours degree</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part-time students</h2>

<p>Part-time students need to study their courses at a rate of at least 25% of an equivalent full-time course in each academic year.</p>

<p>This is known as ‘course intensity’. You can check course intensity with your university or college.</p>

<h2>Age</h2>
<p>There’s no upper age limit for Tuition Fee Loans or grants. To apply for a Maintenance Loan you can’t be over 60.</p>


</article><article id="repayments"><header><h1>Part 6: Repayments</h1>
  </header><p>You only have to pay back Tuition Fee Loans and Maintenance Loans. You pay interest on these.</p>

<p>You don’t have to pay back other student finance, eg any grants and bursaries. </p>

<h2>How much you pay back</h2>
<p>Your repayments are linked to your income. You only make repayments when your income is over £21,000 a year. If your income drops below this amount repayments stop.</p>

<p>Part-time students sometimes start repayments while they’re still studying.</p>

<p>Each month you pay back 9% of any income over £21,000</p>
