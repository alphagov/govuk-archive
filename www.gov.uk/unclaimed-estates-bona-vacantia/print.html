</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Bona vacantia is the legal name for ownerless property that passes to the Crown (the government) by law. It can be any kind of property, like buildings, money or personal possessions.</p>

<p>You could be entitled to a share in a deceased relative’s estate (their possessions) that has passed to the Crown or be affected by a company being closed down (dissolved).</p>

<h2>Who represents the Crown</h2>

<p>The Treasury Solicitor looks after bona vacantia for the Crown. It gets involved when:</p>

<ul>
<li>companies are dissolved </li>
  <li>a person dies with no will or known family and their estate is referred to the Treasury Solicitor</li>
</ul>
<p>The Treasury Solicitor has 2 groups dealing with bona vacantia.</p>

<h3>The Estates Group</h3>

<p>This group looks after people’s estates, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>bank and building society accounts</li>
  <li>life insurance</li>
  <li>property</li>
  <li>anything else owned by the person when they died</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s a <a href="http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/estates-list.aspx" title="list of unclaimed estates" rel="external">list of unclaimed estates</a> and some frequently-asked questions on the Treasury Solicitor’s website.</p>
</div>

<h4>Adverts and claims</h4>

<p>The Treasury Solicitor advertises to find entitled family. If you reply to an advert, you have to prove your relationship with evidence like birth, marriage or death certificates. </p>

<h3>The Companies Group</h3>

<p>This group deals with any assets held by companies when they are dissolved. This is mostly:</p>

<ul>
<li>cash balances</li>
  <li>freehold and leasehold property</li>
  <li>trademarks</li>
  <li>copyright</li>
  <li>mortgages</li>
</ul>
<h3>What the Treasury Solicitor doesn’t deal with</h3>

<p>The Treasury Solicitor handles bona vacantia in England and Wales (except the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster). </p>

<p>Elsewhere it’s dealt with by other organisations. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster - <a rel="external" href="http://www.farrer.co.uk/" title="Farrer and Co">Farrer and Co</a>
</li>
  <li>in Scotland - <a rel="external" href="http://qltr.gov.uk/content/bona-vacantia" title="The Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer">The Queen’s and Lord Treasurer’s Remembrancer</a>

</article><article id="refer-an-estate-to-the-treasury-solicitor"><header><h1>Part 2: Refer an estate to the Treasury Solicitor</h1>
  </header><p>Referring an estate is when you tell the Treasury Solicitor about someone who has died with no will or relatives that you know of.</p>

<p>Before you refer an estate, ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>did the person leave a will - can you contact the executor and beneficiaries?</li>
  <li>can you get in touch with any blood relatives entitled to the estate?</li>
  <li>did the person leave more debts than funds (an ‘insolvent’ estate)?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer to any of these questions is ‘yes’, you shouldn’t refer the estate. If the answer to all the questions is ‘no’ you can <a rel="external" href="https://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/deceased-persons-notification-form.aspx" title="refer the estate online">refer the estate online.</a></p>

<p>The Treasury Solicitor only handles estates worth £500 or more. When the the value is less than £500:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can keep the money, if the estate is just cash</li>
  <li>any saleable belongings should be sold and if they sell for more than £500, you need to refer the estate</li>
</ul></article><article id="check-if-youre-an-entitled-relative"><header><h1>Part 3: Check if you're an entitled relative</h1>
  </header><p>Before making a claim on an estate you need to know if you’re entitled. There are some general rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>if there’s no will, the person’s spouse or civil partner and then any children have first claim to the estate</li>
  <li>if there’s no spouse or child, anyone descended from a grandparent of the person is entitled to a share in the estate</li>
  <li>if you’re related by marriage you have no entitlement</li>
</ul>
<p>The Treasury Solicitor has drawn up a family tree to help you check if you’re entitled.</p>
