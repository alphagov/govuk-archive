<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The National Measurement Office (<abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr>) - previously known as the National Weights and Measures Laboratory (NWML) - regulates the development and use of weighing and measuring equipment to ensure that weights and measures are accurate, fair and legal.</p>

<p>To explain and enforce weights and measures regulations, the <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> works with local authorities’ trading standards departments and inspectors, local weights and measures authorities and approved verifiers of weights and measures equipment.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr>’s consulting services help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to develop specific measuring products, processes or services. It also helps SMEs to understand the regulations covering their weighing and measuring instruments and how to comply with the regulations.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> still provides services under the name of NWML including product certification, quality management systems certification and calibration services to several sectors of industry and local government, all or most of which have some element of weighing or measuring either in their manufacturing processes or in their work.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> works with WELMEC (the European co-operation in legal metrology) and OIML (the International Organisation of Legal Metrology) to maintain UK consumer and business confidence in legal measurement abroad. It also takes part in preparing OIML recommendations and represents the UK at the OIML.</p>

<p>This guide also outlines the work of the <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> Enforcement Authority, the part of the <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> responsible for enforcement work.</p>

<h2 id="the-work-of-the-national-measurement-office">The work of the National Measurement Office</h2>

<p>The National Measurement Office (<abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr>) - previously known as the National Weights and Measures Laboratory (NWML) - is an executive agency of the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>policy on measuring instruments that are used in trade - eg preparing legislation under the Weights and Measures Act 1985 and European Communities Act 1972, and proposals for reforming Weights and Measures Act</li>
  <li>ensuring that the UK implements European directives on measuring instruments</li>
  <li>legal metrology - ie requirements for legal verification of measuring instruments - in the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>Legal metrology makes it possible to buy and sell accurate quantities of goods. Without accurate measurements, there would be no possibility of a fair marketplace.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> helps ensure the accuracy of the majority of measuring instruments used for trade and pre-packaged goods in the UK - including pre-packaged goods in supermarkets, check-out scales, petrol pumps and beer glasses.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> provides guidance to industry and the public, and enforces UK and European Union weights and measures legislation. Key regulations include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Weights and Measures Act 1985 and secondary legislation, including the Weights and Measures (Packaged Goods) Regulations 2006</li>
  <li>the Deregulation (Weights and Measures) Order 1999</li>
  <li>the Measuring Instruments Directive 2004/22/EC and the Non-Automatic Weighing Instruments Regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr>, the National Measurement System (NMS) unit is responsible for scientific and industrial metrology. Scientific metrology deals with the organisation, development and maintenance of measurement standards. Industrial metrology ensures the adequate functioning of measurement instruments used in industry, production and testing processes. The NMS carries out its tasks in a UK network of measurement laboratories, which include the National Physical Laboratory.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.nmo.bis.gov.uk/content.aspx?SC_ID=484">Read information on the National Measurement system on the <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="nwml-services">NWML Services</h3>

<p>The NWML Calibration Team, approved under the UK Accreditation Service maintains standards for mass, volume and length measurement. In addition to calibration, NWML provides testing, product and QMS certification services for industry and local authorities - eg local authority Trading Standards. For more information, see the page in this guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-measurement-office">product certification</a>.</p>

<p>It also provides a consultancy service to manufacturers that are developing new weighing and measuring equipment. For more information, you can also see the page in this guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-measurement-office">consultancy and consulting services</a>.</p>

<h2 id="nmo-enforcement-authority">
<abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> Enforcement Authority</h2>

<p>In recent years, the role of the National Measurement Office (<abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr>) has expanded to include the enforcement of regulations aimed at protecting the environment.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> Enforcement Authority, part of the <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr>, is responsible for enforcing environmental legislation under the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations 2008 (RoHS Regulations) which limits the levels of certain potentially hazardous substances in new electric and electronic equipment for sale in the European Union (EU). <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/nmo/enforcement/rohs-home">Find out about RoHS on the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (BIS) website</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> Enforcement Authority also acts as the UK Batteries Regulations enforcement body, to ensure compliance with the Batteries and Accumulators (Placing on the Market) Regulations 2008. This limits the levels of cadmium and mercury in new batteries for sale within the EU, controls the marking of batteries and sets design requirements for battery-operated electrical and electronic equipment.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> can issue European TACs for all electronic and most mechanical NAWIs. These are valid throughout Europe. If you want to sell your NAWI outside Europe, <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> can approve it in accordance with the relevant OIML recommendations. In this case, <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> issues an OIML Certificate of Conformity and test report. These are valid in countries which are signed up to the OIML mutual acceptance arrangements (MAAs).</p>

<p>If you want to submit your NAWI for <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> certification processes, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>fill in an application form - which you can do online</li>
  <li>forward your supporting documentation</li>
  <li>send in your equipment for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>To simplify the process, <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> can test separate modules of a NAWI and issue individual Test Certificates (TCs). You can quote these TCs in a TAC. This modular approach is useful for indicators, load cells and point of sale devices, and peripheral devices, such as computers and printers.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/weights-measures-and-packaging-the-law">apply for product certification with the online industry service forms from the <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Measuring instruments covered by MID include:</p>

<ul>
<li>automatic weighing instruments</li>
  <li>fuel dispensers</li>
  <li>material measures</li>
  <li>water meters</li>
</ul>
<p>For a period of 10 years from 30 October 2006, existing European Economic Community and UK National TACs will remain valid for instruments that now come under the MID Directive. You can contact the <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> to find out how to convert an existing TAC to an MID approval, as well as applying for approval for a new instrument under MID. However, you should note that the <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> is not a notified body for gas and electricity meters.</p>

<h3 id="temperature-and-humidity-testing-equipment">Temperature and humidity testing equipment</h3>

<p><abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> can test and certify temperature testing equipment from 55°C to -25°C, and humidity testing equipment up to 95 per cent relative humidity. You can access the <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr>’s environmental test chambers for research or pre-compliance testing.</p>

<h3 id="uk-national-type-approvals">UK National Type approvals</h3>

<p>All measuring instruments that are used for trade purposes in the UK require a UK National Type Approval certificate. These include measuring instruments for:</p>

<ul>
<li>intoxicating liquor</li>
  <li>dynamic axle weighers - automatic vehicle weighbridges</li>
  <li>cubic measures</li>
</ul>
<p>You can apply to the <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> for product certification or for pre-assessment.</p>
