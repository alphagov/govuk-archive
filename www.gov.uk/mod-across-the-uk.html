The key <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> airfield at Lyneham in Wiltshire is the current home of the C-130 Hercules fleet, and all the UK’s defence equipment is bought and supported by the military/civilian project teams who have their headquarters at <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Abbey Wood near Bristol.</p>

<h3 id="wiltshire">Wiltshire</h3>

<p>Wiltshire is home to many of the Army’s main garrisons which are clustered around the Salisbury Plain military training area.</p>

<p>Salisbury Plain training area is the largest military training estate in the UK, covering 38,000 hectares.

<p>HQ 3 Division and 12 Mechanized Brigade, 1 Mechanized Brigade and 43 (Wessex) Brigade are based in the neighbouring towns of Bulford and Tidworth.</p>

<p>There are several other major Army units based at key sites across South Wiltshire including at Larkhill, Warminster and Upavon plus dozens of minor units situated in the area.</p>
