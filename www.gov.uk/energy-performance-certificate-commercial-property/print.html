<div class="advisory">

</div>

<h2>How much it costs</h2>

<p>The cost of an <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr> is set by the market and market demand. All EPCs are valid for 10 years.</p>


</article><article id="how-to-get-a-certificate"><header><h1>Part 2: How to get a certificate</h1>

<p>The type of assessor you’ll need will depend on the complexity and features of the building. If you need advice on choosing one, speak to a commercial (non-domestic) energy assessor or contact the approved accreditation scheme they belong to.</p>


</article><article id="exemptions"><header><h1>Part 3: Exemptions</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t need an Energy Performance Certificate (<abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr>) for your commercial property if you can demonstrate that:</p>

<li>the lease is only being renewed or extended  </li>
  <li>it’s a temporary building that will be used for less than 2 years </li>
  <li>it’s a detached, non-residential building with a total floor space less than 50 square metres</li>
  <li>the building is due to be demolished and there are relevant planning permissions as well as official consents if it’s a listed building or in a conservation area</li>
  <li>it’s an industrial site, workshop or non-residential agricultural building that doesn’t use a lot of energy, eg it isn’t air conditioned</li>
  <li>the property is being bought following a compulsory purchase order from the court </li>
  <li>it’s a place of worship</li>
</ul></article><article id="appeal-a-fine"><header><h1>Part 4: Appeal a fine</h1>
