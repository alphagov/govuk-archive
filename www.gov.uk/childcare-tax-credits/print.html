  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="what-you-get"><header><h1>Part 1: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>You could get extra tax credits to help pay for some of your childcare costs while you’re working. </p>

<p>You could get:  </p>

<ul>
<li>up to £122.50 a week - for 1 child </li>
  <li>up to £210 a week - for 2 children or more</li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t get 100% of the costs and how much you get depends on things like: </p>

<ul>
<li>your income </li>
  <li>how often and for how long you’ve paid for childcare</li>
</ul>
<h2>Childcare vouchers</h2>

<p>If you get childcare vouchers from your employer the amount of tax credit you get can go down. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/calcs/ccin.htm" title="Childcare - better off calculator" rel="external">childcare calculator</a> to see how childcare vouchers from your employer affects your tax credits.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 2: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>Usually, you’ll qualify for tax credits to help with childcare if: </p>

<ul>
<li>you qualify for Working Tax Credit </li>
  <li>you’re responsible for the child </li>
  <li>the childcare you pay for is registered or approved </li>
  <li>you work the right number of hours for childcare tax credits</li>
</ul>
<h2>Registered or approved care</h2>

<p>The childcare must be registered or approved (the carer can confirm this). Childcare can include care provided at home, in school or another place by a childminder, playscheme, nursery or club etc.</p>

<h3>Exception - foster carers</h3>

<p>A foster carer doesn’t need to be registered or approved if the care is outside the child’s home and the child is: </p>

<ul>
<li>aged 8 to 16 (Wales only)</li>
  <li>aged 12 to 16 (Northern Ireland only)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can’t be a foster parent claiming costs for your own foster child.</p>
</div>

<h3>Schools</h3>

<p>Usually, the care must be outside of school hours and on the school’s premises. </p>

<h3>Relatives or partners</h3>

<p>Usually, you can’t claim for childcare provided by a relative or partner (even if they’re registered). Check with the <a href="/contact-the-tax-credit-office" title="Contact details for Tax Credit Office">Tax Credit Office</a>.</p>

<h2>Hours you work</h2>

<p>You must work at least 16 hours a week. You might still qualify if you’re on leave from work, eg maternity leave or sick leave. </p>

<p>Couples usually have to work at least 16 hours a week each. Only one of you has to work these hours if the other is: </p>

<ul>
<li>entitled to carer’s allowance </li>
  <li>in hospital or prison </li>
  <li>getting certain benefits or credits for disability or illness - eg Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance or a disability premium for Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/tax-credits-calculator" title="Tax credit calculator">tax credit calculator</a> to check if you qualify.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="how-to-claim"><header><h1>Part 3: How to claim</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re new to tax credits, contact the Tax Credit Helpline for a claim form. It takes up to 2 weeks to arrive. </p>

<p>If you’re already claiming tax credits you don’t need a claim form - just call the Tax Credit Helpline to update your claim.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Tax Credit Helpline</strong><br><strong>Telephone:</strong> 0345 300 3900<br><strong>Textphone:</strong> 0345 300 3909</p>
</div>

<h2>What you need to know</h2>

<p>You can claim at any time of the year and up to 7 days before you start using childcare (if you’re already getting tax credits). </p>

<p>You can’t claim online or download a claim form. </p>

<p>To support your claim, keep records about the carer’s registration and the money you pay them (eg receipts or invoices). </p>

<p><a href="/changes-affect-tax-credits" title="Changes that affect your tax credits">Report any changes</a> to your childcare because they can affect how much money you get. For example, if you start paying more for your childcare. </p>
