  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing homeworking expenses for your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>Homeworking expenses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>equipment, services or supplies you provide to employees who work from home (eg computers, office furniture, internet access, pens and paper)</li>
  <li>additional household expenses, such as gas or electricity charges, for employees who need to work from home</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><h2>Equipment, services and supplies</h2>

<p>If you provide equipment, services and supplies to an employee who works from home, you don’t have to report or pay anything if either:</p>

<ul>
<li>they are only used for business purposes, or any private use is insignificant</li>
  <li>you provide them to an employee who earns <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional household expenses</h2>

<p>If you cover the cost of additional household expenses for an employee who works from home, you don’t have to report or pay anything if all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>they need to work from home, either because equipment they need isn’t available at your workplace, or their work means they have to live too far away from your workplace to travel there every day</li>
  <li>the amount you give them isn’t more than their additional household expenses</li>
  <li>the amount you give them isn’t more than the current weekly limit</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table shows the weekly limit for tax years up to 2012 to 2013:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Tax years</th>
      <th>Weekly limit</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2012 to 2013</td>
      <td>£4.00 (or £18 a month for employees paid monthly)</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>2008 to 2009 — 2011 to 2012</td>
      <td>£3.00</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>2007 to 2008 and earlier</td>
      <td>£2.00</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If any of the homeworking expenses you cover aren’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-homeworking/whats-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you may have to report the costs to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and deduct or pay tax and National Insurance on them.</p>

<h2>Equipment, services and supplies</h2>

<p>If you provide these for both business and private use for employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or more, or company directors, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>fill in form P11D, section L</li>
  <li>pay Class 1A National Insurance on the <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-homeworking/work-out-the-value" title="value of the benefit">value of the benefit</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional household expenses</h2>

<p>If you cover any costs over the weekly limit (£4.00 from tax year 2012 to 2013, or £18 a month for employees paid monthly), you need to to be able to prove that the payments are no more than your employee’s additional household expenses.</p>

<p>If the payments you make are more than your employee’s additional household expenses they count as earnings, so you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/expenses-and-benefits-homeworking/work-out-the-value" title="work out the excess">work out the excess</a> and add this to your employee’s other earnings</li>
  <li>deduct and pay <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax and Class 1 National Insurance through payroll</li>
</ul></article><article id="work-out-the-value"><header><h1>Part 4: Work out the value</h1>
  </header><h2>Equipment, services and supplies</h2>

<p>Use the cost to you of providing the equipment, services or supplies.</p>

<h2>Additional household expenses</h2>

<p>If you don’t have any supporting evidence of the cost of your employee’s additional household expenses, use the total cost to you minus the £4.00 a week limit.</p>

<p>If you do have supporting evidence that shows the level of your employee’s additional household expenses, use any amount above these additional expenses.</p>
