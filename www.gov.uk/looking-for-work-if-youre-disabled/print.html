  </header><p>When you’re looking for work, look for the ‘positive about disabled people’ symbol (with 2 ticks) on adverts and application forms.</p>

<p>The symbol means the employer is committed to employing disabled people.</p>

<p>If a job advert displays the symbol, you’ll be guaranteed an interview if you meet the basic conditions for the job.</p>

<p>Find out about jobs in your area at <a rel="external" href="http://los.direct.gov.uk/default.aspx" title="your local Jobcentre">your local Jobcentre.</a></p>

<h2>Disability Employment Advisers</h2>

<p>A Disability Employment Adviser (<abbr title="Disability Employment Adviser">DEA</abbr>) at your local Jobcentre can help you find a job or gain new skills and tell you about disability friendly employers in your area.</p>

<p>They can also refer you to a specialist work psychologist, if appropriate, or carry out an ‘employment assessment’, asking you about:</p>

<ul>
<li>your skills and experience</li>
  <li>what kind of roles you’re interested in</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask to speak to a <abbr title="Disability Employment Adviser">DEA</abbr> at <a rel="external" href="http://los.direct.gov.uk/default.aspx" title="your local Jobcentre">your local Jobcentre.</a></p>

<h2>Programmes and grants</h2>

<p>Your <abbr title="Disability Employment Adviser">DEA</abbr> can tell you about programmes and grants to help you back into work. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/work-choice/" title="Work Choice">Work Choice</a> - to help you find a job, and get support when you start work</li>
  <li>
<a href="/residential-training/" title="Residential Training">Residential Training</a> - to give you work experience and training</li>
  <li>
<a href="/access-to-work/" title="Access to Work grants">Access to Work</a> - money towards a support worker or for the cost of equipment or travelling to work</li>
</ul></article><article id="applying-for-a-job"><header><h1>Part 2: Applying for a job</h1>
  </header><h2>Questions about your health or disability</h2>

<p>An employer isn’t normally allowed to ask you questions about your health or disability before they offer you a job.</p>

<p>They can only ask you about this for very limited reasons, for example to:</p>

<ul>
<li>make ‘reasonable adjustments’ - eg if you need a large print version of a test</li>
  <li>decide if you can do something that is an essential part of the job</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you’re treated unfairly when you apply for a job</h2>

<p>Contact the <a href="/discrimination-your-rights/contact-the-equality-and-human-rights-commission/" title="Equality and Human Rights Commission">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> if you think you’ve been treated unfairly.</p>

<p>You may also be able to take a complaint to an <a href="/employment-tribunals/" title="employment tribunal">employment tribunal</a> - you have to do this within 3 months of the discrimination happening.</p>
