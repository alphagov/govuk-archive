<p>The Permanent Joint Headquarters (<abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr>) is an adaptable and agile HQ created to command Joint and Combined military operations, and provide politically aware military advice to the Ministry of Defence. It is at the forefront of work throughout British Defence to further improve joint operational capability.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> was established in April 1996 to enhance the operational effectiveness and efficiency of UK-led joint, potentially joint and multi-national operations, and to exercise operational command of UK forces assigned to multinational operations led by others.</p>

<p>In career terms, we intend that the <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> should be the first choice for the most promising military and civilian staff to develop their skills in the best environment.</p>

<h2 id="pjhq-organisation">
<abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> organisation</h2>

<p>The Chief of Joint Operations (<abbr title="Chief of Joint Operations">CJO</abbr>) heads <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> and is responsible for the planning and execution of UK-led joint, potentially joint and multinational operations, and for exercising operational command of UK Forces assigned to multinational operations led by others.</p>

<p>The appointment is rotational between the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force. The current incumbent is Lieutenant General David Capewell OBE.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Chief of Joint Operations">CJO</abbr>’s mission statement:</p>

<p>“<abbr title="Chief of Joint Operations">CJO</abbr> is to exercise operational command of UK forces assigned to overseas joint and combined operations; and to provide politically aware military advice to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> in order to achieve <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> UK’s strategic objectives on operations.” </p>

<p><abbr title="Chief of Joint Operations">CJO</abbr> has a deputy, the Chief of Staff (Operations) (COS (Ops)). COS (Ops) is responsible for executing <abbr title="Chief of Joint Operations">CJO</abbr>’s primary role – the planning and execution of operations.</p>

<p>The rest of <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> is organised by Divisions (numbered J1-J9). Each Division is led by a senior officer or senior civil servant and is responsible for a particular area of capability.</p>

<p>The specific responsibilities of each Division are:</p>

<ul>
<li>J1 - Personnel</li>
  <li>J2 - Operational Intelligence</li>
  <li>J3 - Current Operations</li>
  <li>J4 - Logistics/Medical</li>
  <li>J5 - Crisis and deliberate planning</li>
  <li>J6 - Communication and Information Systems</li>
  <li>J8 - Finance and Human Resources</li>
  <li>J9 - Policy, legal and media operations</li>
</ul>
<p>The HQ has personnel from the 3 Services and the Civil Service. The HQ is responsible for directing, deploying, sustaining and recovering UK joint forces, however, there are certain areas that the HQ will not be involved.</p>

<p>These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strategic Nuclear Deterrent</li>
  <li>Defence of the UK Home Base</li>
  <li>Territorial Waters and Airspace</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>Counter-terrorism in UK</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr> Article V (General War)</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Chief of Joint Operations">CJO</abbr> also commands the Joint Support Unit in Northwood. This small unit led by a Royal Air Force Group Captain who is responsible for supporting not only <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> but also Fleet and <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr> personnel who also use the Northwood site.</p>

<h2 id="pjhq-organisation-command-and-control">
<abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> organisation command and control</h2>

<p><abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> - The <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr>’s primary function is the planning and execution of joint, potentially joint and UK-led multinational operations. The <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> also has embedded within it a dedicated Command Secretariat, which provides policy, legal, presentation and financial advice to <abbr title="Chief of Joint Operations">CJO</abbr> during an operation.</p>

<p>Through this close relationship between civilian and military personnel, <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> is able to give politically aware military advice to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>.
Joint Commander - <abbr title="Chief of Joint Operations">CJO</abbr> will normally be appointed as the Joint Commander, although Chief of Defence Staff (<abbr title="Chief of Defence Staff">CDS</abbr>) may appoint one of the operational Commanders-in-Chief (<abbr title="Commander-in-Chief">CINC</abbr>) to act as a more senior Joint Commander if the operation is of a Large Scale.</p>

<p>In this case, <abbr title="Chief of Joint Operations">CJO</abbr> will act as the Deputy Joint commander whilst still retaining the mantle of Joint Commander for other operations.</p>

<p>Single-Service advice - The <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> has a number of dedicated single-Service appointments that work closely with their respective single-Service Operational Command HQs and have ready access to key members of staff and the single-Service deputies when required. This complements the advice given by <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Directorates and allows full single-Service advice to be woven into coherent joint advice before submission to <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Central Staff. Thus <abbr title="Chief of Defence Staff">CDS</abbr> and Ministers are provided with a fully balanced assessment on all aspects of a joint operation.</p>

<p>Supporting Commands - The 3 single-Service <abbr title="Commander-in-Chiefs">CINCs</abbr> are responsible for providing forces for joint and multinational operations. These forces will be made available to <abbr title="Chief of Joint Operations">CJO</abbr> through the Joint Rapid Reaction Force which was established as a result of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review.</p>

<h2 id="pjhq-organisation-joint-rapid-reaction-forces">
<abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> organisation Joint Rapid Reaction Forces</h2>

<p>The establishment of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces (<abbr title="Joint Rapid Reaction Forces">JRRF</abbr>) was the most important Joint initiative in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review (SDR). The <abbr title="Joint Rapid Reaction Forces">JRRF</abbr> is a pool of highly capable units from all services that are maintained at high readiness for contingency operations. </p>

<p><abbr title="Chief of Joint Operations">CJO</abbr> is responsible for the <abbr title="Joint Rapid Reaction Forces">JRRF</abbr>, although until deployed, <abbr title="Operational Command">OPCOM</abbr> of the units is retained by the single-Service <abbr title="Commander-in-Chiefs">CINCs</abbr>. Units within the <abbr title="Joint Rapid Reaction Forces">JRRF</abbr> are trained to Joint standards and are deployed in Joint force packages, tailored to meet the operational requirement. The pool is configured to mount operations up to medium scale warfighting and can be employed nationally or multinationally under <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr>, EU, UN or other ad hoc coalition.</p>

<p>To command the <abbr title="Joint Rapid Reaction Forces">JRRF</abbr> a fully resourced Joint Task Force HQ (<abbr title="Joint Task Force HQ">JTFHQ</abbr>) is maintained at 48 hours notice to move. An initial <abbr title="Joint Rapid Reaction Forces">JRRF</abbr> capability was declared in April 1999 with the full capability being introduced in 2001.</p>

<h2 id="pjhq-history">
<abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> history</h2>

<p>The need for a permanently established tri-service headquarters grew out of the increasingly unstable and uncertain post cold war world.</p>

<p>By the early nineties the hoped for ‘new world order’ had failed to materialise and the UK had already found itself embroiled in war in the middle east as well as a growing involvement in the increasing unstable Balkans.</p>

<p>Up until that point, responsibility for the planning and conduct of any UK-led or joint overseas operation had been handed to one of the single services.</p>

<p>In 1982 Operation CORPORATE in the South Atlantic (the operation to recover the Falkland Islands) was planned and controlled by Fleet and Strike took the lead for Op GRANBY (the liberation of Kuwait) in 1991.</p>

<p>The changing geopolitical scene and the prospect of more UK forces being deployed in theatres around the world was one of the main driving forces behind the Defence Costs Study (<abbr title="Defence Costs Study">DCS</abbr>) which recommended the creation of a Permanent Joint Headquarters.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Defence Costs Study">DCS</abbr> highlighted a number of serious shortcomings in the handling of defence, not least the essentially ad hoc and reactive way in which operations were planned and conducted by the single services.</p>

<p>The establishment of a Joint Headquarters was driven therefore by the desire to enhance operational efficiency and effectiveness and achieve financial savings.</p>

<p>This was supported by a recognition of the need for a pro-active, permanently manned organisation that would ensure a smooth transition from the early planning stages of a potential deployment, through to the conduct of a joint operation, and subsequently the recovery of forces and adoption of lessons learned.</p>

<p>The then Secretary of State agreed the proposed delegation of functions related to the planning and conduct of operations from <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Main Building to a new Joint Headquarters.</p>

<p>From its original inception it was understood that there was a need to establish a proper policy/execution divide with the Ministry of Defence handling the strategic policy, <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> focusing on the conduct of the operations and the Front Line Commands supporting and delivering the required military capability.</p>

<p>The location chosen for the establishment of this new headquarters was Northwood. The <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> who established Coastal Command Headquarters there in 1938 had originally purchased the 35-hectare site.</p>

<p>By 1996 when <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> was established, the Northwood base was also home to the Commander in Chief of Fleet and the <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr> Commander Allied Maritime Component Command Naval Forces North who still remain.</p>

<p>The Headquarters was officially opened on 3 May 1996 by The Rt Hon Mr Michael Portillo MP, Secretary of State for Defence and was declared fully operational on 1 August of the same year.</p>

<p>The Headquarters was scaled originally to handle the five concurrent operations then running in addition to other business such as the command of the Permanent Joint Operating Bases. Since then <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> has grown as the number and tempo of operations has increased.</p>

<p>On 6 May 2010 Her Majesty The Queen, accompanied by His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh, opened the new Joint Headquarters building at Northwood. Designed to accommodate 950 people, the new building will allow for the collocation of all <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> staff for the first time since its inception in 1996. The building also hosts a separate multinational headquarters which will permit multinational or EU-led operations to operate on site without the constraints of embedding non-UK national staff within <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr>’s facilities.</p>

<h2 id="other-organisations">Other organisations</h2>

<p>Other Organisations at the Northwood HQ.</p>

<h3 id="multinational-headquarters-mnhq">Multinational Headquarters (<abbr title="Multinational Headquarters">MNHQ</abbr>)</h3>

<p>In order to meet the Chief of Defence Staff’s directive to provide the core of an Operational HQ (<abbr title="Operational HQ">OHQ</abbr>) and the core of a Force HQ (<abbr title="Force HQ">FHQ</abbr>) for European Union-led military Crisis Management Operations (<abbr title="Crisis Management Operations">CMOs</abbr>), a <abbr title="Multinational Headquarters">MNHQ</abbr> facility has been developed at Northwood.</p>

<p>The facility is located in Bldg 410, in the same building as <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr>, and part of it has already been activated to provide an <abbr title="Operational HQ">OHQ</abbr> for command of the EU-led Counter-Piracy operation (Op ATALANTA). The whole facility provides essential infrastructure for a multinational staff based around a <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> Key Nucleus and is provided with a direct secure communications link into Brussels.</p>

<h3 id="commander-in-chief-fleet">Commander-in-Chief Fleet</h3>

<p>The flag of the Commander in Chief Fleet has flown over the Northwood Headquarters since its transfer from the Portsmouth-based depot ship HMS TYNE in 1960 in the guise of <abbr title="Commander-in-Chief">CINC</abbr> Home Fleet.</p>

<p>By 1971, this had grown to encompass <abbr title="Commander-in-Chief Fleet">CINCFLEET</abbr> (Commander-in-Chief Fleet), and the <abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr> (Royal Navy) took over responsibility for the whole site. The principal aim of the Commander in Chief is to prepare and operate the Fleet in both war and peace, delivering operational capability and providing maritime advice and services to other Government Departments.</p>

<p>To this end, he exercises full command of all the Royal Navy’s surface ships, submarines, aircraft, Fleet Auxiliaries and the Corps of Royal Marines - in total some 33,000 <abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr> personnel and over 4,000 civilian staff.</p>

<p>In April 2002, as a result of the ‘Fleet First’ initiative, most of <abbr title="Commander-in-Chief Fleet">CINCFLEET</abbr> staff moved to Portsmouth, and the Northwood site became the tri-Service establishment it now is.</p>

<p><abbr title="Commander-in-Chief Fleet">CINCFLEET</abbr> himself, and a residual core of staff, have remained at Northwood so that he can carry out his parallel <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr> job of <abbr title="Commander Allied Naval Forces North">COMNAVNORTH</abbr> (Commander Allied Naval Forces North).</p>

<br><br>##Northwood Headquarters
<br><br>Northwood Headquarters, the UK’s principal military HQ site is home to 5 Operational HQs Joint Forces Command HQ (including Permanent Joint Headquarters and the JFHQ), the Commander Naval Forces North (one of <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr>'s three major Commanders) and Headquarters of Commander in Chief Fleet) and was almost completely rebuilt between 2006-11, resulting in a purpose-built HQ site for 2000 personnel.  Northwood HQ is commanded by an OF5 who is responsible for providing all support services and for overseeing delivery of the PFI Contract with Carillion PLC.
<br><br>Northwood has seen much expansion over the past two decades and is still evolving. With the modern command, control and communications facilities installed here to allow both the Chief of Joint Operations to direct national operations world-wide and the Commander in Chief to direct Maritime Operations, Northwood is very much in the front line.
<br><br>Eastbury Park Northwood was the home of the Headquarters of Coastal Command, Royal Air Force from 1939 to 1969. It was in fact the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> who started going underground to build their Headquarters.
<br><br>In 1953 the Headquarters of the <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr> Commander-in-Chief Eastern Atlantic Area was established at Northwood. The Commander-in-Chief was also Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet who flew his flag in HMS TYNE at Portsmouth.
<br><br>In 1960 <abbr title="Commander-in-Chief">CINC</abbr> HOME FLEET moved to Northwood and in 1966 the <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr> Channel Command (a post also held by <abbr title="Commander-in-Chief">CINC</abbr> Home Fleet) moved to Northwood from Portsmouth. In April 1963 the Naval unit at Northwood was commissioned as HMS WARRIOR under the command of the then Captain of the Fleet.
<br><br>In 1966 the command was established for a Commander in Command and in September 1971 the <abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr> took over responsibility for the whole establishment. In 1978 the Flag Officer Submarines who is also Command Submarines Eastern Atlantic (COMSUBEASTLANT) moved from HMS DOLPHIN at Gosport to Northwood.
<br><br>HMS WARRIOR was a self-accounting Fleet Establishment, under the command of the Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command. The base at Northwood now accommodates the National Commands of Fleet, the Permanent Joint Headquarters and the <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr> Commands of East Atlantic, Submarines East Atlantic and Maritime Air East Atlantic.
<br><br>In July 1994, as a part of the Defence Costs Study, it was decided to form a <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr> at Northwood, to replace the previous approach whereby headquarters staffs were drawn together ad hoc in response to a developing crisis.
<br><br>The primary role of the <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr>, therefore, is to be responsible for the planning and execution of UK-led joint, potentially joint, combined and multi-national operations.

<h2 id="history-of-the-site">History of the site</h2>

<p>Northwood lies in an area once covered by vast forests, hunted and fought over by Romans and ancient Britons. The British tribe, the Belgar, who lived in this part of the country, distinguished themselves when, in 54 BC under Cassivellaunus, they almost defeated the Romans under Julius Caesar. Boudicca (Boadicea) is reputed to have died at Stanmore.</p>

<p>In Saxon times Offa, King of the Middle Saxons, entrusted the district to the Abbey of St Albans.</p>

<p>In Norman times, Northwood and Eastcote were hamlets within the manor of Ruislip and references to Northwode and Northwood have been found in old documents.</p>

<p>Not until 1854 did Northwood take on an identity of its own with the building of Holy Trinity Church. At this time only about 200 people lived in Northwood and their occupations were rural. Still a hamlet and a collection of farms on the edge of Rickmansworth, Pinner, Ruislip, Harefield and Watford parishes, it retained its rustic nature until the late 1890s.</p>

<p>The opening of Northwood station in 1887 began the process of gradual change into an urban residential area. In 1894, with the passing of the Local Government Act, people began to claim urban powers. Since then the population has grown rapidly to 80,000 due to the enormous expansion of London.</p>

<p>Local associations in history include that of the only English Pope, Nicholas Breakspear, with Harefield; Cardinal Wolsey and the Duke of Monmouth with Moor Park; Thomas Gray, who wrote Elegy in a Country Churchyard, with Stoke Poges; and Milton, who alternated between boredom and matrimonial strife at Chalfont St Giles.</p>

<p>Finally, it was recorded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I that “Five Ruislipians and eight Uxbridge men with unknown malefactors to the number of a hundred, assembled themselves and played a certain unlawful game called football, by reason of which there arose a great affray, like to result in homicides and serious accidents.”</p>

<p>Eastbury Park Northwood was the home of The Headquarters of Coastal Command, Royal Air Force from 1939 to 1969 and is now the home of its successor HQ 3 Group.</p>

<p>It was in fact the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> who started going underground to build their Headquarters. In 1953 the Headquarters of the <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr> Commander-in-Chief Eastern Atlantic Area was established at Northwood. The Commander-in-Chief was also Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet who flew his flag in HMS TYNE at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>In 1960 <abbr title="Commander-in-Chief">CINC</abbr> HOME FLEET moved to Northwood and in 1966 the <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr> Channel Command (a post also held by <abbr title="Commander-in-Chief">CINC</abbr> Home Fleet) moved to Northwood from Portsmouth. In April 1963 the Naval unit at Northwood was commissioned as HMS Warrior under the command of the then Captain of the Fleet.</p>

<p>In 1966 the command was established for a Commander in Command and in September 1971 the <abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr> took over responsibility for the whole establishment. In 1978 the Flag Officer Submarines who is also COMSUBEASTLANT moved from HMS DOLPHIN at Gosport to Northwood.</p>

<p>HMS WARRIOR was a self-accounting Fleet Establishment, under the command of the Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command. The base at Northwood now accommodates the National Commands of Fleet, the Permanent Joint Headquarters, Flag Officer Submarines and 3 Group, and the <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">NATO</abbr> Commands of East Atlantic, Submarines East Atlantic and Maritime Air East Atlantic.</p>

<p>In July 1994, as a part of the Defence Costs Study, it was decided to form a Permanent Joint Headquarters (<abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr>) at Northwood, to replace the previous approach whereby headquarters staffs were drawn together ad hoc in response to a developing crisis.</p>

<p>The primary role of the <abbr title="Permanent Joint Headquarters">PJHQ</abbr>, therefore, is to be responsible for the planning and execution of UK-led joint, potentially joint, combined and multi-national operations.</p>

<h2 id="chateau-de-madrid">Chateau de Madrid</h2>

<p>The Officers’ Mess at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Northwood Coastal Command.</p>

<p>The Madrid Room in the present Officers’ Mess maintains the links with the former Chateau de Madrid which was the original Northwood Headquarters Officers’ Mess shown here which was destroyed by fire in 1969.</p>

<p>Built in 1858 for Lord Palmerston, the chateau dominated the large Eastbury Park Estate. For many years it was a girls’ school until 1920 when it became the Chateau de Madrid Country Club which had a somewhat dubious reputation and was allegedly one of the late HRH The Duke of Windsor’s haunts in the Edwardian era.</p>

<p>The chateau and adjoining land were purchased in 1938 by the Royal Air Force for use as Coastal Command Headquarters and the reputation of the chateau was salvaged!</p>

<h2 id="coastal-command-commemorative-window">Coastal Command Commemorative window</h2>

<p>The Coastal Command Commemorative window was originally in the JHQ Building.</p>

<p>In the centre of the window stands the figure of a typical Coastal Command aircrew - pilots, navigators, signallers, radar operators, flight engineers or gunners all looked much the same although of many nationalities: Polish, Czechoslovakian, Dutch, Norwegian and United States squadrons joined forces in the maritime air battle in close and friendly partnership with the Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, South African and United Kingdom squadrons of Coastal Command.</p>

<p>They fought together as a band of brothers and had the same determination to seek out and destroy the enemy wherever he was to be found.</p>

<p>This particular aircrew symbolises their everyday task; he is dressed in his normal flying kit and is flashing his Aldis lamp the recognition signal of the day to the nearest corvette or destroyer guarding the convoy to be joined.</p>

<p>No signal was so welcome to those who sailed in the convoyed ships and the majority of threatened convoys were met day or night, irrespective of weather, throughout the war.</p>

<p>The central figure stands upon a pile of the weapons used in the anti-U-boat and anti-enemy shipping war - the depth charge, the torpedo and the bomb being the most prominent.</p>

<p>Below this are the convoys which were - in conjunction with the ships of the Royal and Allied Navies - the aircrews’ daily task to guard and here can be seen the signs of enemy activity and our counter-attacks.</p>

<p>In this lower part of the window is symbolised the hardest fought victory during which the men at sea and in the air fought with their various craft, the weapons, the fuel and the many scientific devices and instruments designed, fashioned or produced by the thousands of anonymous men and women working behind the scenes in many different countries.</p>

<p>It also symbolises the work of those who planned and directed the war at sea and co-ordinated the allied effort.</p>

<p>Above and beyond the central figure are two hands clasping the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force ensigns, typifying the marriage of these two great services for their triple task of finding the enemy, striking the enemy and protecting our ships.</p>

<p>Behind and framing the ensigns and dominating all the top of the window is the sun at dawn as seen by those thousands of aircrew who flew against the enemy over the vast expanse of sea of some ten million square miles and this will symbolise to many the relief felt by those upon the sea and in the air that another day had started and with God’s help our ships were a day nearer safety.</p>

<p>The badges of the subordinate formations of Coastal Command adorn the sides of the window, while the Command badge is in the place of honour at the top. Those formations without badges are shown at the base of the window below the words “Constant Endeavour” - the Coastal Command motto: never were such words so well chosen.</p>

<p>On either side of the motto the Blue and Red Ensigns are included to remind us of the heroic endurance of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, the Merchant Navy and the fishing fleets. The badges of the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy flank the main window in the adjacent top side panels, thus completing the picture.</p>
