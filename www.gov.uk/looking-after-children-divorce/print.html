    <section role="main"><header><h1>Looking after children if you divorce or separate, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll need to make arrangements for your children if you split up from your partner.</p>

<p>A court won’t let you divorce or dissolve a civil partnership until you can show you’ve sorted out things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>where the children will live</li>
  <li>when they’ll spend time with each parent</li>
  <li>who will pay child maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you can’t agree</h2>

<p>You can go to a ‘mediation information and assessment meeting’ with a family mediator.</p>

<p>This is to see if you can reach an agreement with your partner without going to court.</p>

<p>Contact a <a rel="external" href="http://www.familymediationhelpline.co.uk/find-service.php/" title="family mediation service">family mediation service</a> to arrange a meeting.</p>

<p>If you can’t agree on these arrangements, you can ask the court to decide using a court order.</p>

</article><article id="types-of-court-order"><header><h1>Part 2: Types of court order</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for a single court order, or a number of them, depending on what you’ve been unable to agree on.</p>

<h2>Where your child will live</h2>

<p>A ‘residence order’ is used to decide where your child will live, and which parent they’ll live with.</p>

<h2>Seeing your child if you don’t live with them</h2>

<p>A ‘contact order’ is used to decide when you can see your child, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>at weekends</li>
  <li>during school holidays</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your child’s upbringing</h2>

<p>A ‘specific issue order’ is used to look at a specific question about how the child is being brought up, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>what school they go to</li>
  <li>if they should have a religious education</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also apply for a ‘prohibited steps order’ to stop the other parent from making a decision about the child’s upbringing.</p>

<h2>Who can apply</h2>

<p>The child’s mother, father or anyone with <a href="/parental-rights-responsibilities/what-is-parental-responsibility" title="parental responsibility">parental responsibility</a> can apply for a court order.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Other people, like grandparents, can apply for these court orders, but they’ll need to get permission from the courts first.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="apply-for-court-order"><header><h1>Part 3: Apply for a court order</h1>
  </header><p>To apply for a court order, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2253">C100 court form.</a> </p>

<p>Send it to your local <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/" title="county court or family proceedings court">county court or family proceedings court.</a></p>

<p>A court order costs £200.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You may be able to get help with <a href="/court-fees-what-they-are/" title="court fees">court fees</a> if you’re on benefits or a low income.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll be asked to go to a court appointment. You may also have to go to a court hearing.</p>

<p>Judges and magistrates must always put the welfare of children first. They’ll only make a court order if they think it’s in the child’s best interests.</p>

</article><article id="after-you-apply-for-a-court-order"><header><h1>Part 4: After you apply for a court order</h1>
  </header><p>If you apply for a court order, the court will arrange a <a rel="external" href="http://www.cafcass.gov.uk/about_cafcass/info_for_families/divorce_and_separation/your_questions_answered.aspx" title="information on court hearings">‘directions hearing’</a> with both parents. </p>

<p>There will usually be a family court adviser from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.cafcass.gov.uk/default.aspx">Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (<abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>)</a> at the meeting.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> will send you information before the hearing - they’ll usually ring you too.</p>
</div>

<p>At the hearing, a judge or magistrate will try to work out:</p>

<ul>
<li>what you can agree</li>
  <li>what you can’t agree</li>
  <li>if your child is at risk in any way</li>
</ul>
<p>They’ll encourage you to reach an agreement if it’s in the child’s best interests. If you can, and there are no concerns about the child’s welfare, the judge or magistrate can end the process. </p>

<p>If necessary, the court will make a consent order which sets out what you have agreed.</p>

<h2>If you can’t agree at the first court hearing</h2>

<p>The judge or magistrate will set a timetable for what happens next.</p>

<p>They may ask you to try again to reach an agreement, eg with a mediator.</p>

<p>If your case is about contact issues, you may have to go on a course, called a ‘Separated Parents Information Programme’, with other parents.</p>

<p>This could help you work out how to make contact arrangements work.</p>

<p>You usually have to go to 2 meetings. Your ex-partner won’t be at the same meetings as you. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you reach agreement at any stage, the judge or magistrate can stop the process.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> reports</h2>

<p>The court can ask <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> to provide a report on your case to help decide what’s best for the child.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> officer may ask your child about their feelings. You’ll get a copy of the report when it’s written. </p>

<h2>What judges and magistrates consider</h2>

<p>They’ll always put the welfare of children first. They will think about the:</p>

<ul>
<li>child’s wishes and feelings</li>
  <li>child’s physical, emotional and educational needs</li>
  <li>effect any changes may have on the child</li>
  <li>child’s age, gender, characteristics and background</li>
  <li>possible risk of harm to the child</li>
  <li>ability of parents to meet the child’s needs</li>
  <li>orders the court has the power to make</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A judge or magistrate will only make an order if they think it’s in the child’s best interests.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you disagree with an order</h2>

<p>You should get legal advice - you can <a rel="external" href="http://legaladviserfinder.justice.gov.uk/AdviserSearch.do" title="find a legal adviser">find a legal adviser</a> or call Community Legal Advice on 0845 345 4345.</p>
