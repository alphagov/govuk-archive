  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="when-you-can-annul-a-marriage"><header><h1>Part 1: When you can annul a marriage</h1>
  </header><p>Annulment is a way of ending a marriage, like divorce.</p>

<p>Unlike divorce, you can get a marriage annulled at any time after the wedding (in a divorce, you have to wait at least a year).</p>

<p>You may want an annulment if you have religious reasons against divorce.</p>

<p>However, you need to show that the marriage was either not valid in the first place, or is defective for one of the reasons given below.</p>

<h2>1. Your marriage is not legally valid - ‘void’ marriages</h2>

<p>You can annul a marriage if it was not legally valid in the first place, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>you are closely related</li>
  <li>you are the same sex</li>
  <li>one of you was under 16</li>
  <li>one of you was already married or in a civil partnership</li>
</ul>
<p>If a marriage was not legally valid, the law says that it never existed.</p>

<p>However, you may need legal paperwork to prove this - eg if you want to get married again.</p>

<h2>2. Your marriage is defective - ‘voidable’ marriages</h2>

<p>You can annul a marriage if:</p>

<ul>
<li>it wasn’t consummated (you haven’t had sex with the person you married since the wedding)</li>
  <li>you didn’t properly consent to the marriage - eg you were drunk or forced into it</li>
  <li>the other person had a sexually transmitted disease when you got married</li>
  <li>the woman was pregnant by another man when you got married</li>
</ul>
<p>Marriages annulled for these reasons are known as ‘voidable’ marriages.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The rules on annulling a civil partnership are slightly different, but the court forms are the same.</p>

<h2>Make arrangements for children</h2>

<p>You need to fill in another form if you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>children under 16</li>
  <li>children under 18 in education</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to include details of arrangements for:</p>

<ul>
<li>childcare</li>
  <li>maintenance</li>
  <li>contact with your children</li>
</ul>
<p>Fill in a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=158" title="statement of arrangements for children">statement of arrangements for children.</a></p>

<p>Send 2 copies of this form to the court with the nullity petition form. Keep your own copies.</p>

</article><article id="apply-for-a-decree-nisi"><header><h1>Part 3: Apply for a decree nisi</h1>
  </header><p>The other person must respond to your nullity petition within 8 days, saying if they agree the marriage should be annulled.</p>

<p>If they agree, you can apply for a ‘decree nisi’.</p>

<p>To get a decree nisi, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=154" title="application for decree nisi/conditional order">application for decree nisi/conditional order.</a></p>

<h2>Statement in support of annulment</h2>

<p>You must also fill in a statement confirming that what you said in your nullity petition is true.</p>

<p>Use one of the forms below, depending on whether your marriage is ‘void’ or ‘voidable’:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2649" title="statement in support of annulment - void marriage">statement in support of annulment - void marriage</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2650" title="statement in support of annulment - voidable marriage">statement in support of annulment - voidable marriage</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>See <a href="/how-to-annul-marriage/when-you-can-annul-a-marriage" title="when you can annul a marriage">when you can annul a marriage</a> for the difference between ‘void’ and ‘voidable’ marriages.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="apply-for-a-decree-absolute"><header><h1>Part 4: Apply for a decree absolute</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for a decree absolute 6 weeks after you get the decree nisi.</p>

<p>In these cases, it’s also called a ‘decree of nullity’. This is the final legal document which says that the marriage has been annulled.</p>

<p>To apply for a decree of nullity, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=1114" title="notice of application for decree nisi to be made absolute">notice of application for decree nisi to be made absolute.</a></p>

<p>A decree absolute costs £45.</p>

<h2>When you return your forms</h2>

<p>The court will check if there are any reasons that the marriage can’t be annulled. In most cases, you don’t need to go to court for this.</p>

<p>If the court is happy, it will send you the decree of nullity. This will confirm that you’re no longer married.</p>
