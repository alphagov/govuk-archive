Your marriage is not legally valid - 'void' marriages\r\n\r\nYou can annul a marriage if it was not legally valid in the first place, eg:\r\n\r\n- you are closely related\r\n- you are the same sex\r\n- one of you was under 16\r\n- one of you was already married or in a civil partnership\r\n\r\nIf a marriage was not legally valid, the law says that it never existed.\r\n\r\nHowever, you may need legal paperwork to prove this - eg if you want to get married again.\r\n\r\n##2.
