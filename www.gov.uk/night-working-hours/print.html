  </header><p>If someone works at night, there are rules covering the hours they work.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Before someone starts working at night, they must be offered a free <a href="/night-working-hours-for-your-staff/health-assessments" title="health assessments">health assessment</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Night time hours and limits</h2>

<p>Night time working hours are usually between 11pm and 6am - but this can be flexible if agreed between workers and the employer.  </p>

<p>The agreement must be in writing. The night time period must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be 7 hours long</li>
  <li>include the period between midnight and 5am</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff who regularly work for at least 3 hours during this period are night workers. Workers may also be a night workers if:</p>

<ul>
<li>there’s a collective agreement (between the employer and the workers or their representatives) that states what counts as night work</li>
  <li>it’s likely that they’ll work a proportion of their annual working time during the night</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules about how long staff work at night are based on <a href="/maximum-weekly-working-hours/calculating-your-working-hours" title="calculating working hours">average working time</a>, which is usually calculated over a 17-week period. </p>

<p>If the workers and the employer both agree as part of a collective or workforce agreement, the working hours can be averaged over a longer period, eg up to 52 weeks.</p>

<p>Employers must make sure that workers don’t work more than an average of 8 hours in a 24-hour period. Workers can’t opt out of this working limit.</p>

<p>Employers must keep records of night workers’ working hours to prove they aren’t exceeding night working limits. Employers must keep the records for at least 2 years.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Workers shouldn’t be <a href="/discrimination-your-rights" title="Discriminations: your rights">discriminated against</a> because they refuse to work nights.</p>
</div>

<h2>Young workers and staff dealing with special hazards</h2>

<p>Some workers must be treated differently:</p>

<ul>
<li>staff under 18 are not usually allowed to work at night - there are also <a href="/child-employment/restrictions-on-child-employment" title="employing staff under 18">other restrictions</a> on when they can work</li>
  <li>night workers who deal with special hazards or whose work involves mental or physical strain can’t work longer than 8 hours in any 24-hour period</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Special hazards and work involving mental or physical strain should be identified as part of <a href="/health-safety-at-work/employer-risk-assessments" title="Employer risk assessments">risk assessments</a>. They may also be set out in collective or workforce agreements.</p>
</div>

<h2>Exceptions to night hours limits</h2>

<p>There are some jobs and situations <a href="/night-working-hours/exceptions-to-night-work-limits" title="exceptions to night work limits">when night work limits don’t apply</a>.</p>


</article><article id="exceptions-to-night-work-limits"><header><h1>Part 2: Exceptions to night work limits</h1>
  </header><p>The normal limits on night worker hours don’t usually apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the armed forces or emergency services in certain circumstances (eg when dealing with a disaster situation)</li>
  <li>to domestic servants employed in a private house</li>
  <li>for people who do jobs where they choose how long they work, eg managing executives, freelancers</li>
</ul>
<p>There are separate rules for workers in <a href="/drivers-hours" title="drivers' hours">road</a>, <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/shipsandcargoes/mcga-shipsregsandguidance/marinenotices/mcga-mnotice.htm?textobjid=550E6A6B50FC1723" title="hours of work at sea">sea</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=1498&amp;pagetype=90&amp;pageid=8447" title="hours of work in air transport">air transport.</a></p>

<p>Limits on night work also don’t apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>in an industry with busy peak periods, eg agriculture, retail, tourism or security and surveillance work </li>
  <li>if there’s an emergency or accident</li>
  <li>in jobs that need round-the-clock staffing, eg hospital work</li>
  <li>if a member of staff has to travel a long distance from home to work or constantly works in different places</li>
  <li>if a collective or workforce agreement excludes or changes the restriction on night work </li>
</ul>
<h2>Rest breaks</h2>

<p>In these cases, workers must get ‘compensatory rest’ instead of a normal working week and breaks during the day. </p>

<p>This is a minimum 90 of hours rest a week on average, but it may not be at normal times.</p>

<p>Employers must also follow the general <a href="/maximum-weekly-working-hours" title="rules on working hours">rules on working hours</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re not sure whether these exceptions apply in your situation, contact the <a href="/pay-and-work-rights-helpline" title="Pay and work rights helpline">pay and work rights helpline</a>.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="health-assessments"><header><h1>Part 3: Health assessments</h1>
  </header><p>Workers must be offered a free health assessment before they become a night worker and on a regular basis after that. </p>

<p>Employers can do this with a questionnaire to see if the worker is fit to work nights. They should ask a qualified health professional for help developing the questionnaire.</p>

</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The worker should also be offered a follow-up examination by a health professional if the employer is unsure they’re fit to be a night worker.</p>
</div>

<p>Employers must keep <a href="/data-protection-your-business/recruitment-managing-staff-records" title="Managing staff records">confidential</a> records of:</p>

<ul>
<li>night staff’s health assessments (keep these for 2 years)</li>
  <li>dates when staff were offered a health assessment (if they didn’t want one)</li>
</ul>
<p>Employers should also take into account that night work might increase a <a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=1072&amp;p=0" title="Acas stress at work booklet">worker’s stress levels.</a></p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If a worker has health problems that a doctor thinks are related to being a night worker, the employer should offer them suitable other work where possible.</p>
