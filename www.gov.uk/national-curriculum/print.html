  </header><p>The national curriculum is a set of subjects and standards used by <a href="/types-of-school" title="Types of school">primary and secondary schools</a> so children learn the same things. It covers what subjects are taught and the standards children should reach in each subject.</p>

<p>Other <a href="/types-of-school" title="Types of school">types of school</a> like <a href="/types-of-school/academies" title="Academies">academies</a> and <a href="/types-of-school/private-schools" title="Private schools">private schools</a> don’t have to follow the national curriculum. Academies must teach a broad and balanced curriculum including English, maths and science. They must also teach religious education.</p>

<h2>Key stages</h2>

<p>The national curriculum is organised into blocks of years called ‘key stages’ (KS). At the end of each key stage, your child’s teacher will formally assess their performance to measure your child’s progress.</p>

<h3>Levels of attainment</h3>

<p>For each subject there’s a ‘programme of study’. It describes what children should learn. There are also ‘attainment targets’ - usually split into 8 levels for each subject. You’ll get a school report at the end of the year telling you what level your child is at. <a rel="external" href="http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/index.aspx" title="National Curriculum online">Read more about what children will learn.</a></p>

<h3>Early years</h3>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DCSF-00261-2008" title="Early Years Foundation Scheme">Early Years Foundation Scheme</a> sets standards for the learning, development and care of children from birth to 5. It must be followed by all childminders, preschools and nurseries. It has levels of development most children can be expected to reach by age 5.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Sex and relationship education</h2>

<p>Compulsory from age 11 onwards, sex and relationship education (<abbr title="Sex and relationship education">SRE</abbr>) involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health. The importance of stable relationships (eg marriage) and family life are emphasised. <abbr title="Sex and relationship education">SRE</abbr> doesn’t promote early sexual activity and it doesn’t promote any particular sexual orientation.</p>

<p>Some elements of sex and relationship education are mandatory - these are part of the national curriculum for science. Parents can withdraw their children from all other parts of sex and relationship education if they want.</p>

<h2>Religious education</h2>

<p>Schools also have to teach religious education but parents can withdraw their children for all or part of the lessons. Local councils are responsible for deciding on a syllabus.</p>
