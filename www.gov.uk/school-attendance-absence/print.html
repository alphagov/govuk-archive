  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You must make sure your child gets a full-time education that meets their needs (eg if they have special educational needs). You can send your child to school or educate them yourself.</p>

<p>Children must get an education between the school term after their 5th birthday and the last Friday in June in the school year they turn 16.</p>

<p>If your child is unexpectedly missing from school and the local council thinks you’re not home schooling them, you’ll be contacted by the school or the council’s educational welfare officer. They’ll contact you even if your child is only missing for a day.</p>

<p>You can be prosecuted if you don’t give your child an education. You’ll normally get warnings and offers of help from the local council first.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can <a href="/education-attendance-council" title="education and attendance information from your council">get education and attendance information from your council.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>When your child can miss school</h2>

<p>You can only allow your child to miss school if either:</p>

<ul>
<li>they’re too ill to go in</li>
  <li>you’ve got advance permission from the school</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s <a href="/illness-child-education" title="extra support if your child has a health problem">extra support available</a> if your child can’t go to school for long periods because of a health problem.</p>
</div>

<h3>Holidays in term time</h3>

<p>You have to get permission if you want to take your child on holiday during term time. You can only do this if:</p>

<ul>
<li>an application is made to the head teacher in advance of the holiday by a parent the child normally lives with</li>
  <li>there are special reasons for needing to take the holiday, eg if your holiday leave isn’t flexible</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications should be made as far in advance of the holiday as possible - and it’s the school’s decision, not a parental right.</p>

</article><article id="help-with-getting-your-child-to-go-to-school"><header><h1>Part 2: Help with getting your child to go to school</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re having trouble getting your child to go to school, the school and local council can help. </p>

<p>The school will discuss attendance problems with you and should agree a plan with you to improve your child’s attendance.</p>

<p>A lot of local councils have teams that help parents improve their child’s attendance at school. The council will tell you if they’re able to help. Forms of help could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>support to reduce the burden on children where families are in difficulty (eg if a child is spending a lot of time caring for someone)</li>
  <li>working with families and schools to overcome bullying and other serious problems</li>
  <li>a parenting contract</li>
</ul>
<h2>Parenting contract</h2>

<p>This is a voluntary written agreement between you and either the local council or the school’s governing body. Between you, you agree to find ways to improve your child’s attendance.</p>

<p>If you refuse to make a contract or you don’t stick to it, it can be used as evidence if the local council decides to prosecute you.</p>

</article><article id="legal-action-to-enforce-school-attendance"><header><h1>Part 3: Legal action to enforce school attendance</h1>
  </header><p>Local councils and schools can use various legal powers if your child is missing school without a good reason:</p>

<ul>
<li>Parenting Order</li>
  <li>Education Supervision Order</li>
  <li>School Attendance Order</li>
  <li>penalty notice</li>
  <li>prosecution</li>
</ul>
<p>You can be given one or more of these orders but the council doesn’t have to do this before prosecuting you.</p>

<h2>Parenting Order</h2>

<p>This means you have to go to parenting classes. You’ll also have to do what the court says to improve your child’s school attendance.</p>

<h2>Education Supervision Order</h2>

<p>If the council thinks you need support getting your child to go to school but you’re not co-operating, they can apply to a court for an Education Supervision Order. </p>

<p>A supervisor will be appointed to help you get your child into education. The local council can do this instead of prosecuting you, or as well.</p>

<h2>School Attendance Order</h2>

<p>You’ll get a School Attendance Order if the local council thinks your child isn’t getting an education. You have 15 days to provide evidence that you’ve registered your child with a school or that you are <a href="/home-education" title="home schooling">home schooling</a> them. </p>

<p>The order will require you to send your child to a specific school. If you don’t, you may be prosecuted.</p>

<h2>Penalty notice</h2>

<p>Instead of being prosecuted, you can be given a penalty notice. The penalty is £60, rising to £120 if it isn’t paid within 28 days. If you don’t pay the fine, you’ll be prosecuted.</p>

<h2>Prosecution</h2>

<p>You could get a fine of up to £2,500, a community order or a jail sentence up to 3 months. The court also gives you a Parenting Order.</p>
