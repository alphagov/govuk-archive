Your case will be sent to a Parole Board automatically after 28 days. They will either release you straight away or set a date (within 1 year) when you can be released on licence.\r\n\r\n##Extended sentences\r\nIf you're on an extended sentence, your case will be sent to a Parole Board within 14 days of you going back to prison.
