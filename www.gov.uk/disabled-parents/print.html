  </header><h2>Starting a family</h2>

<p>As a <a href="/definition-of-disability-under-the-equality-act-2010" title="Definition of disability">disabled person</a>, you have the right to make your own mind up about becoming a parent. </p>

<p>You shouldn’t be denied fertility treatment because you’re disabled.</p>

<p>Your health and well-being are factors in adoption assessments but you mustn’t be automatically disqualified because you are disabled.</p>

<h2>Your child(ren)</h2>

<p>Your child shouldn’t be identified as ‘in need’ because you’re disabled (although this could be a factor). A child-in-need assessment should only be carried out if there are concerns about your child’s well-being.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A ‘child in need’ is a child under 17 whose health and development is likely to be made significantly worse without support.</p>
</div>

<p>The Human Rights Act 1998 is relevant to disabled parents, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>Article 12: The right to marry and to found a family - social care services and health providers should take all reasonable steps to help you have a family including giving advice and support before and after your child is born</li>
</ul></article><article id="benefits-and-help"><header><h1>Part 2: Benefits and help </h1>
  </header><p>You could get extra help at home as a disabled parent. Ask for a <a href="/apply-needs-assessment-social-services" title="Apply for a needs assessment by social services">health and social care assessment</a> to work out what help you need. You can get the assessment before you have your child.</p>

<p>If you get <a href="/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit" title="Disability Living Allowance">Disability Living Allowance (DLA)</a>, the amount of benefit you’re entitled to may change if you have a child. Contact the Disability Living Allowance helpline. </p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Disability Living Allowance helpline</strong><br><strong>Telephone:</strong> 08457 123 456<br><strong>Textphone:</strong> 08457 22 44 33</p>
</div>

<p>Your <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1" title="Contact your local council">local council</a> must make sure disabled people are supported in their family and parental roles. They can support you in several areas, eg visiting your child’s school.</p>

<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>The Disabled Living Foundation has information on equipment for disabled parents.</p>

<div class="form-download">

</div>
