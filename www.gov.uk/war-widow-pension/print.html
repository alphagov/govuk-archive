<p>If you’re a War Widow, War Widower whose late spouse or civil partner left service before 31 March 1973, you can keep your pension if you remarry or start to live with a partner after 6 April 2005.</p>

</ul>
<p>Make sure you tell Service Personnel and Veterans Agency of any changes in your circumstances so you get the right amount of pension.</p>
