  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="different-ways-to-donate"><header><h1>Part 1: Different ways to donate</h1>
  </header><p>Most charities let you make a donation through their website. If you pay tax you can give direct from your pay packet, pension, or when you make a self assessment tax return. You can also leave money or assets (like land or buildings) to charity in your will.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.cafonline.org" title="Charities Aid Foundation (CAF)">Charities Aid Foundation (CAF)</a> website can help you find a charity and make a donation.</p>

</article><article id="donating-straight-from-your-wages-or-pension"><header><h1>Part 2: Donating straight from your wages or pension</h1>
  </header><p>If you pay tax through Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>), ‘Payroll Giving’ lets you reduce the cost to you of making regular gifts to UK charities. </p>

<p>If your employer, company or personal pension provider runs a Payroll Giving Scheme, you simply tell them to make the donation from your wages or pension before taking off any tax. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> You pay tax at the basic rate of 20% and make a monthly donation of £10. That means you save £2 tax (20% of £10). The actual cost of the donation to you is £8.</p>

  </header><h2>Choosing a charity</h2>
<p>To use Self Assessment Giving, enter a charity reference code on the ‘Giving your tax repayment to charity’ form that comes with your tax return. To get a charity’s reference code, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>search the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/charities/charities-search.htm" title="HMRC: Charities registered for SA Donate">HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) online database</a>
</li>
  <li>telephone the <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/contactus/search.ladv?raction=view&amp;fl0=__dsid%3A&amp;sm=0&amp;ha=34&amp;as=1&amp;sf=&amp;sp_scope=hmrc&amp;sc=hmrc&amp;nh=10&amp;sr=0&amp;cs=ISO-8859-1&amp;tx1=&amp;tx0=49641" title="HMRC Charities Helpline"><abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Charities Helpline</a>
</li>
  <li>ask the charity</li>
</ul>
<p>You can only choose one charity to give your repayment to each year. </p>

<p>If your charity isn’t listed, you’ll have to make a donation yourself once you’ve received your refund.</p>

<h2>How much can you give?</h2>
<p>You can give some or all of your tax refund. If you don’t want to donate the whole amount you can set an upper limit. If your repayment is more than this, the rest will be paid to you.</p>

<p><abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will let you know how much your repayment is and when it was sent to the charity.</p>

<h2>How to make your donation</h2>
<p>Fill in form <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?formid=3003&amp;record=U3f41R1qFQE" title="SA100 Charity: Giving Your Tax Repayment to Charity">SA100.</a></p>

<p>You can do this online if you use <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Self Assessment online service.</p>


</article><article id="leaving-gifts-to-charity-in-your-will"><header><h1>Part 4: Leaving gifts to charity in your will</h1>
  </header><p>If you will pay <a href="/inheritance-tax" title="Inheritance Tax">Inheritance Tax</a>, you could pay less by choosing to give money to charity.</p>

<p>You can either leave a fixed amount, or some or all of what’s left after other gifts have been given out.</p>

<p>You can do this through your will. Make sure it’s clear which charity you want to receive your gift.</p>

</article><article id="keeping-records"><header><h1>Part 5: Keeping records</h1>
  </header><p>You must keep records of your donations to charity to make sure that you claim the correct amount of tax relief and pay the right amount of tax.</p>

<p>For every tax year, you should keep:</p>

<ul>
<li>details of Gift Aid donations – showing the date, the amount and the charities involved</li>
  <li>legal documents showing the sale or transfer of assets (eg land or buildings) to charity</li>
  <li>any documents from a charity asking you to sell land or shares on its behalf</li>
