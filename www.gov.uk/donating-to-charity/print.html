</article><article id="gift-aid"><header><h1>Part 2: Gift Aid</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re a UK taxpayer, you can increase the value of your charity donations by choosing to donate through ‘Gift Aid’.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>As a taxpayer, you’ll already have paid tax on any money you donate to charity. When you donate, the charity will ask you whether you want donate through Gift Aid – if you do, they’ll be able to claim back the tax you originally paid at the basic rate of 20%.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>You earn £125 and £25 tax is deducted from this at the basic rate of 20%. This leaves you with £100. You then donate the £100 to charity through Gift Aid.  </p>

<p>The charity can claim an extra £25 (the tax you paid at basic rate) from the government to make your total donation £125.</p>
</div>

<h2>Make sure you’ve paid enough tax</h2>

<p>If you give through Gift Aid, you need to make sure that you’ve actually paid the amount of tax that the charity will claim back. Eg if you donate £100 in a tax year, you must have paid at least £25 tax over the year. </p>

<p>The tax could have been paid in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/income-tax" title="Income Tax">income</a></li>
  <li>savings</li>
  <li>investments or rental income</li>
  <li><a href="/capital-gains-tax" title="Capital Gains Tax">‘capital gains’</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Higher rate taxpayers</h2>

<p>If you pay tax at the higher rate of 40% or above, you can claim back the difference between the higher and basic rate on the value of your donation:</p>

<ul>
<li>through your <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Self Assessment tax return</a>
</li>
  <li>by contacting HMRC and asking them to <a href="/reporting-your-tax-code-as-wrong" title="Amend your tax code">amend your tax code</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>You donate £100 to charity through Gift Aid – they claim 20% to make your donation £125. You pay 50% tax so you can personally claim back £37.50 (£125 x 30%).</p>
</div>

</article><article id="donating-straight-from-your-wages-or-pension"><header><h1>Part 3: Donating straight from your wages or pension</h1>
  </header><p>If you pay tax through Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>), ‘Payroll Giving’ lets you reduce the cost to you of making gifts to UK charities. </p>

<p>If your employer, company or personal pension provider runs a Payroll Giving scheme, you simply tell them to make the donation from your wages or pension before taking off any tax. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> </p>

<p>You pay tax at the basic rate of 20% and make a monthly donation of £10. That means you save £2 tax (20% of £10). The actual cost of the donation to you is £8.</p>

  </header><p>If you pay <a href="/inheritance-tax" title="Inheritance Tax">Inheritance Tax</a>, you could pay less by choosing to give money to charity.</p>

<p>You can either leave a fixed amount, or some or all of what’s left after other gifts have been given out.</p>

<p>You can do this through your will. Make sure it’s clear which charity you want to receive your gift.</p>

</article><article id="keeping-records"><header><h1>Part 5: Keeping records</h1>
  </header><p>You need to keep records of your donations to charity if you want to claim tax relief on them. You can claim tax relief on gifts of land or shares, or some <a href="/donating-to-charity/gift-aid" title="Gift Aid">Gift Aid</a> donations (eg if you pay higher rate tax, get age-related allowances or claim tax credits).</p>

<p>Make sure you claim the correct amount of tax relief and pay the right amount of tax by keeping:</p>

<ul>
<li>details of Gift Aid donations – showing the date, the amount and the charities involved</li>
  <li>legal documents showing the sale or transfer of assets (eg land or buildings) to charity</li>
  <li>any documents from a charity asking you to sell land or shares on its behalf</li>
</ul>
<p>You normally have to keep your records for at least 22 months from the end of the tax year they relate to, or 5 years and 1 month if you’re in business.</p>
