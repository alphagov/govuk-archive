</article><article id="vehicle-classes"><header><h1>Part 3: Vehicle classes</h1>
  </header><p>When deciding which class of vehicle you’d like to test, you’ll need to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>the equipment needed to test the vehicles</li>
  <li>the size and layout of your premises</li>
  <li>whether the <a href="/become-an-mot-tester" title="become an MOT tester">Nominated Tester</a> is approved to test the different vehicle types you want to MOT</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements to test different classes</h2>

<p>The current requirements for testing each vehicle class are in the guides below. </p>

<p>These are just the minimum requirements - think carefully before deciding on your layout as it may affect the size or type of vehicle you’ll be able to test.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to make sure that you have a Nominated Tester who’s  approved to test the type of vehicles you’re applying to test.</p>
