  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply to end (‘dissolve’) your civil partnership if you have been in the partnership for at least a year.</p>

<p>There are 3 main steps to ending a civil partnership:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>File a dissolution petition</strong> - you have to apply to court for permission to end your civil partnership, and show reasons why you want to split up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply for a conditional order</strong> - if your civil partner agrees to the petition, you’ll get a document saying there’s no reason you can’t divorce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply for a final order</strong> - this legally ends your civil partnership - you need to wait 6 weeks after you get the conditional order before you can apply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Ending a civil partnership without using solicitors</h2>

<p>You may be able to arrange your own divorce without involving solicitors if you agree on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the reasons for dissolving the civil partnership</li>
  <li>how you’ll split up money, property and possessions</li>
  <li>how you’ll look after any children</li>
</ul>
<p>If you agree on these things beforehand, you won’t have to go to a court hearing, and the paperwork should be fairly straightforward.</p>

</article><article id="grounds-for-ending-a-civil-partnership"><header><h1>Part 2: Grounds for ending a civil partnership</h1>
  </header><p>You have to show the relationship has irretrievably broken down, and that you have good reasons for ending the civil partnership.</p>

<p>There are 4 grounds for ending a civil partnership:</p>

<h2>1. Unreasonable behaviour</h2>

<p>Your partner has behaved so badly that you can no longer bear to live with them.</p>

<p>This could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>physical or mental cruelty</li>
  <li>verbal or physical abuse</li>
  <li>being irresponsible with money</li>
  <li>being sexually unfaithful</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Desertion</h2>

<p>Your partner has left you:</p>

<ul>
<li>without your agreement</li>
  <li>without a good reason</li>
  <li>to end your relationship</li>
  <li>for more than 2 years in the past 2½ years</li>
</ul>
<p>You can still claim desertion if you have lived together for up to a total of 6 months within this period.</p>

<h2>3. You have lived apart for more than 2 years</h2>

<p>You can get a dissolution if you have lived apart for more than 2 years, and both agree to end the civil partnership.</p>

<p>Your civil partner must agree in writing to end the civil partnership.</p>

<h2>4. You have lived apart for more than 5 years</h2>

<p>Living apart for more than 5 years is usually enough to end a civil partnership, even if your civil partner disagrees.</p>

</article><article id="file-a-petition"><header><h1>Part 3: File a petition</h1>
  </header><p>To end a civil partnership, you first need to fill in a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=1115" title="dissolution petition">dissolution petition.</a></p>

<p>You must include your:</p>

<ul>
<li>full name and address</li>
  <li>civil partner’s full name and address</li>
  <li>civil partnership certificate (the original certificate or a copy from a register office)</li>
</ul>
<p>Include the names and dates of birth of any children (no matter how old they are).</p>

<h2>Make arrangements for children</h2>

<p>You need to fill in a separate form if you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>children under 16</li>
  <li>children under 18 at school or college, or on a training course</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to include details of arrangements for:</p>

<ul>

  <li>maintenance</li>
  <li>contact with your children</li>
</ul>
<p>Fill in a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=158" title="statement of arrangements for children">statement of arrangements for children.</a></p>

<h2>Pay the court fee</h2>

<p>You will have to pay a £340 court fee to file the dissolution petition.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You may be able to get help with <a href="/court-fees-what-they-are/" title="court fees">court fees</a> if you’re on benefits or a low income.</p>
</div>

<h2>Send the forms</h2>

<p>Once you have filled in the forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>send 2 copies to the court</li>
  <li>keep your own copies</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where to send the forms</h2>

<p>You can send the forms to:</p>

<ul>
<li>any county court that deals with civil partnerships</li>
  <li>the Principal Registry of the Family Division in London</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have to visit the court, so try to <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/" title="find a court">find a court</a> that’s easy to get to.</p>

<p>The courts are also listed on the last page of the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetLeaflet.do?court_leaflets_id=106" title="about divorce/dissolution leaflet">about divorce/dissolution leaflet.</a></p>

</article><article id="apply-for-a-conditional-order"><header><h1>Part 4: Apply for a conditional order</h1>
  </header><p>You can get a conditional order if your partner agrees to end the civil partnership.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A conditional order is the 1st of 2 stages to getting the civil partnership dissolved - the 2nd stage is getting a final order.</p>
</div>

<p>If your partner doesn’t agree to end the civil partnership, you can still apply for a conditional order. You’ll have to go to a hearing at the court to discuss the case, where a judge will decide whether to grant you the conditional order.</p>

<p>You must wait at least 9 days after your civil partner has received their copy of the dissolution petition.</p>

<h2>Fill in the application form</h2>

<p>To apply for a conditional order, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=154" title="application for a conditional order">application for a conditional order.</a></p>

<p>If your partner is defending the case, fill in section B of the form, saying you want a ‘case management hearing’ before the judge.</p>

<p>You also need to fill in a statement confirming that what you said in your dissolution petition is true.</p>

<p>There are 4 statement forms - use the one that covers the grounds you’ve given for ending the civil partnership:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=144" title="unreasonable behaviour statement">unreasonable behaviour statement</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=146" title="desertion statement">desertion statement</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=149" title="2 years' separation statement">2 years’ separation statement</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=150" title="5 years' separation statement">5 years’ separation statement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The forms will need to show your civil partner:</p>

<ul>
<li>has received the dissolution petition</li>
  <li>agrees to the dissolution if you’re using the fact that you’ve been living apart for 2 years as your reason</li>
  <li>agrees with any arrangement proposed for children</li>
</ul>
<p>Attach your civil partner’s response to the dissolution petition, and send it to the court. Keep your own copy.</p>

</article><article id="apply-for-a-final-order"><header><h1>Part 5: Apply for a final order</h1>
  </header><p>The final order is the legal document that ends your civil partnership.</p>

<p>You have to wait 6 weeks after the date of the conditional order to apply for a final order.</p>

<p>If your civil partner applied for a conditional order, you have to wait 3 months and 6 weeks after the date of the conditional order.</p>

<p>The delay gives you a chance to discuss finances and other issues with your civil partner before the civil partnership comes to an end.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Apply within 12 months of getting the conditional order - otherwise you will have to explain the delay to the court.</p>
</div>

<p>To apply for a final order, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=1114" title="application for a conditional order to be made final">application for a conditional order to be made final.</a></p>

<p>A final order costs £45.</p>

<p>Return the form to the court with the fee. This will usually be the same court that dealt with your conditional order.</p>

<h2>Getting the final order</h2>

<p>The court will check that there are no reasons why the civil partnership cannot be ended.</p>

<ul>
<li>you’ve given it all the details it has asked for within the right time limits</li>
  <li>the needs of any children have been taken into account</li>
</ul>
<p>If the court is happy with all the information, it will send you and your civil partner a final order.</p>

<p>Once you get your final order, your civil partnership has ended and you can enter into another civil partnership if you wish.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must keep your final order safe - you will need to show it if you enter into another civil partnership or to prove your status.</p>
