  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you run an employment agency or employment businesses you have to follow certain rules.</p>

<p>You can’t:</p>

<ul>
<li>charge a fee to a work-seeker for work finding services</li>
  <li>stop someone from working elsewhere or terminating their contract with you</li>
  <li>make someone tell them the name of any future employer</li>
  <li>withhold payments or wages due</li>
  <li>supply a temporary worker to replace someone taking part in <a href="/employment-agencies-and-businesses/employment-agencies-and-trade-unions-" title="industrial action">industrial action</a>
</li>
  <li>charge for a uniform without telling the worker in advance</li>
  <li>make unlawful deductions from pay</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also make sure workers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>paid for all the work they do</li>
  <li><a href="/expenses-and-benefits-holiday-pay" title="paid holiday">paid holiday</a></li>
  <li>not forced to work longer than <a href="/maximum-weekly-working-hours" title="48 hours a week">48 hours a week</a>
</li>
  <li>paid at least the <a href="/national-minimum-wage-rates" title="National Minimum Wage">National Minimum Wage</a>
</li>
  <li>protected under <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/" title="Health and Safety Executive">health and safety laws</a>
</li>
  <li>given written <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions" title="terms of  employment">terms of  employment</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The rules are different for <a href="/entertainment-and-modelling-agencies" title="entertainment and modelling">entertainment and modelling</a> agencies and businesses.</p>
</div>

<h2>Organisations not covered by the rules</h2>

<p>The rules on employment agencies and businesses don’t apply to:</p>

<ul>
<li>university appointment boards or services and certain other educational institutions</li>
  <li>local councils</li>
  <li>trade unions, employers’ organisations and certain professional members bodies</li>
  <li>charities</li>
  <li>certain services provided just for ex-members of HM forces or for people released from prisons and other institutions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Publications advertising work-finding services</h3>

<p>If you run a publication or website totally or mostly aimed at providing a work-finding service you’ll normally have to follow the rules for employment agencies and businesses.</p>

<p>However, if job advertisements are only a small part of what is published then the rules probably don’t apply.</p>

<h2>Paying work-seekers</h2>

<h3>Employment agencies</h3>

<p>If you run an employment agency you aren’t responsible for paying a work-seeker after you’ve introduced them to a hirer.</p>

<h3>Employment businesses</h3>

<p>If you run an employment business you’re responsible for paying the temporary work-seekers you supply.</p>

<p>You must pay a temporary work-seeker for all the hours they work, even if you haven’t been paid by the hirer or the work-seeker hasn’t got a timesheet authorised by the hirer.</p>

<h2>Difference between employment agencies and businesses</h2>

<h3>Employment agencies</h3>

<p>Employment agencies find work for work-seekers who are employed and paid by employers. This is often called ‘permanent employment’ because once the worker has been taken on, they’re an employee of the company they’re working for. However, different rules apply to entertainment and modelling.  </p>

<h3>Employment businesses</h3>

<p>Employment businesses engages a work-seeker under a contract who then works under the supervision of someone else. This is normally called ‘temporary agency work’ or ‘temping’.</p>

<p>Workers under these arrangements are paid by the business instead of the company they’re supplied to.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>When a business does both it has to follow the rules for both employment agencies and employment businesses.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="before-placing-a-worker-with-a-hirer"><header><h1>Part 3: Before placing a worker with a hirer</h1>
  </header><p>Before placing a work-seeker with a hirer, you must get sufficient information from the hirer including:</p>

<ul>
<li>the identity of the hirer and, if applicable, the nature of their business</li>
  <li>the date the hirer needs a work-seeker to start and for how long</li>
  <li>the type of work, location, working hours and any health and safety risks and controls</li>
  <li>the experience, training and qualifications the hirer needs for the post or are needed by law</li>
  <li>any expenses payable by or to the work-seeker</li>
  <li>if you run an agency, the minimum wage, benefits, method of payment, and notice periods for termination of employment (where applicable)</li>
</ul></article><article id="working-with-vulnerable-people"><header><h1>Part 4: Working with vulnerable people</h1>
  </header><p>If you supply work-seekers to work with vulnerable people you have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>get 2 references on the work-seeker and give these to the hirer</li>
  <li>make checks that the work-seeker is suitable for the role</li>
</ul>
<p>If the work-seeker needs professional qualifications for the role you have to get copies of these for the hirer. If you can’t get hold of the qualifications you must tell the hirer you’ve tried to get the information and what steps they’ve done to do so.</p>

<h2>Criminal records checks</h2>

<p>Some industries, eg childcare and healthcare, need their workers to have criminal record checks (<abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> checks).</p>

<p>You may have to make sure that workers you supply have <a href="/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check" title="criminal record checks">criminal record checks</a> for these jobs.</p>


</article><article id="limited-company-contractors-and-opting-out-of-the-rules"><header><h1>Part 5: Limited company contractors and opting out of the rules</h1>
  </header><p>Work-seekers registered as limited companies are also covered by the rules unless they say they want to opt out.</p>

<p>In this case, the hirer must be told this and the rules will no longer apply.</p>

<p>Workers who’ve opted out can decide to follow the rules again, but only when they’ve finished working for the hirer they opted out with.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Limited company workers can’t opt out if they’re going to be working with vulnerable people.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="job-advertisements"><header><h1>Part 6: Job advertisements</h1>
  </header><p>You mustn’t advertise a job without the full details of the position.</p>

<p>You must also make sure the hirer has definitely said they’re looking for someone to fill the position.</p>

<p>All job advertisements must include the full name of your agency or employment business and say if the job is temporary or permanent.</p>

<p>If the rate of pay is included then, the advert must also include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the nature of the job</li>
  <li>the job location</li>
  <li>minimum experience levels</li>
  <li>details of any training needed to do the job</li>
</ul></article><article id="fees-to-hiring-companies-transfer-fees"><header><h1>Part 7: Fees to hiring companies (transfer fees)</h1>
  </header><p>If you run an employment business you can charge transfer fees to hirers:</p>

<ul>
<li>when they’re supplied a temporary worker who is then taken on permanently by the hirer (temp-to-perm fees)</li>
  <li>if the hirer changes agency but wants to keep a temporary worker, meaning the worker has to change agency (temp-to-temp fees)</li>
  <li>if the hirer introduces a temporary worker to another company that wants to temporarily offer them work (temp-to-third-party fees)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can’t try to charge a transfer fee in any other situation. Hirers can recover any money they’ve paid for fees that are against the rules.</p>
</div>

<p>For example, you can’t use transfer fees unreasonably to discourage hirers from:</p>

<ul>
<li>offering permanent work to temporary workers</li>
  <li>getting workers from a different employment business</li>
  <li>introducing workers to a third party to be employed by them</li>
</ul>
<h2>Temp-to-perm and temp-to–temp fees</h2>

<p>You can charge these as long as the hirer has first had the option to have the worker supplied for a set period. After this the worker can transfer without a fee.</p>

<p>Where the hirer opts for a set period, you must supply the worker for all of this time unless prevented from doing this for reasons that aren’t your fault.</p>

<p>The supply terms can’t be worse for the hirer than those before the hirers opted for the set hire period.</p>

<p>You can only charge transfer fees when the transfer takes place in the later period of either:</p>

<ul>
<li>14 weeks of the start of the first assignment with the hirer</li>
  <li>8 weeks of the end of any assignment</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If there’s been more than one assignment with a break of more than 42 days between assignments the later assignment is then taken as the first assignment.</p>
</div>

<h3>Where you introduce but don’t supply a temporary worker</h3>

<p>If you introduce a worker but don’t supply them you can charge an introduction fee.</p>

<p>This fee should follow the same rules as temp-to-perm and temp-to-temp fees but there’s no limit on the agreed period of hire or level of the fee.</p>

<h2>Temp-to-third party fees</h2>

<p>If you supplied a worker who your client introduced to a third party you can charge a transfer fee following the same rules as temp-perm or temp-to-temp fees. However you don’t have to offer the hirer a choice between the transfer fee and an extended period of hire.</p>

</article><article id="terms-and-conditions-"><header><h1>Part 8: Terms and conditions </h1>
  </header><h2>Employment businesses’ terms and conditions with work-seekers</h2>

<p>If you run an employment business you have to agree terms and conditions before starting to find work for work-seekers.</p>

<p>These should cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>that you’re operating as an employment business</li>
  <li>the type of work you’ll find or seek to find for the work-seeker</li>
  <li>if those work-seekers are or will be employed by you under a contract of service, or apprenticeship, or a contract for services, and the terms that will apply</li>
  <li>an undertaking that you’ll pay the work-seeker for all work whether you’re paid by the hirer or not</li>
  <li>the length of notice the work-seeker needs to give and is entitled to get for assignments</li>
  <li>either the rate of pay or minimum rate of pay you reasonably expect to get for the work-seeker</li>
  <li>how often and when the work-seeker will be paid</li>
  <li>the amount of holiday and holiday pay details (the majority of work-seekers will be entitled to <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-holiday-pay" title="statutory holiday pay">statutory holiday pay</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the work-seeker is a limited company (and not <a href="/employment-agencies-and-businesses/limited-company-contractors-and-opting-out-of-the-rules" title="opted out of the rules">opted out of the rules</a>) you must detail when they may be entitled to and be paid for time off.</p>

<p>If you and the work-seeker agree any changes to the terms you must give them a new document with the details of the changes and when they start.</p>

<p>This must be as soon as reasonably practical after the changes are agreed.</p>

<h2>Employment businesses’ terms and conditions with hiring companies</h2>

<p>The first time you propose to provide a service to a hirer, other than the provision of information in the form of a publication, you must agree with the hirer the terms and conditions which apply or will apply between you and the hirer.</p>

<p>You should give them a statement that the services provided will be those of an employment business (ie supplying temporary workers).</p>

<p>You should also set out the details of any fees which the hirer may have to pay, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>the amount of the fee or how it’s worked out</li>
  <li>when any refunds may be payable to the hirer</li>
</ul>
<h3>Procedures for unsatisfactory workers</h3>

<p>You should also set out the procedure if you supply a work-seeker who turns out to be unsatisfactory. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>how and when the hirer should tell you about this</li>
  <li>what you’ll do about it - eg terminate the worker’s assignment, try to solve the problem or supply a different work-seeker</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recording the terms</h3>

<p>You must make sure that all of the terms between you and the hirer are recorded and a copy is given to the hirer as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you and the hirer agree to any changes to the terms you must give the hirer a new document with details of the changes and when they start.</p>

<p>This must be as soon as reasonably practical after the changes are agreed.</p>

</article><article id="employment-agencies-and-trade-unions-"><header><h1>Part 9: Employment agencies and trade unions </h1>

  <li>they’re a member of a union or won’t agree to stop being a member</li>
  <li>they won’t agree to make a payment (eg to a union or charity) in lieu of union membership or to allow a prospective employer to deduct money from their pay to make a payment like this</li>
</ul>
<h2>Employment tribunals</h2>

<p>Work-seekers can go to an <a href="/being-taken-to-employment-tribunal-by-employee" title="employment tribunal">employment tribunal</a> if they think they’ve been unlawfully refused employment or the services of an employment agency on trade union membership grounds.</p>
