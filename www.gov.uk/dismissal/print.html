  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Dismissal is when your employer ends your employment - they don’t always have to give you notice.</p>

<p>If you’re dismissed, your employer must show they’ve:</p>

<ul>
<li>a valid reason that they can justify</li>
  <li>acted reasonably in the circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>They must also:</p>

<ul>
<li>be consistent - eg not dismiss you for doing something that they let other employees do</li>
  <li>have investigated the situation fully before dismissing you - eg if a complaint was made about you</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re a part-time or fixed-term worker, you can’t be treated less favourably than a full-time or permanent employee.</p>
</div>

<h2>Notice period</h2>
<p>You must be given at least the notice stated in your contract or the statutory minimum notice period, whichever is longer. </p>

<p>There are some situations where you can be <a href="/dismissal/reasons-you-can-be-dismissed" title="When you can be dismissed">dismissed immediately</a> - eg for violence.</p>

<h2>Getting your dismissal in writing</h2>

<p>You have the right to ask for a written statement from your employer giving the reasons why you’ve been dismissed if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>an employee and have completed one year’s service</li>
  <li>employed under a fixed-term contract which has ended and not been renewed</li>
</ul>
<p>Your employer must supply the statement within 14 days of you asking for it.</p>

<p>If you’re dismissed while you are on Statutory <a href="/maternity-leave" title="Maternity Leave">Maternity Leave</a>, your employer must give you a written statement. You get this:</p>

<ul>
<li>even if you’ve not asked for one</li>
  <li>regardless of how long you’ve worked for your employer</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re unsure of your employment status, speak to your employer or <a href="/employment-status" title="Check your employment status">check your employment status</a>.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="reasons-you-can-be-dismissed"><header><h1>Part 2: Reasons you can be dismissed</h1>
  </header><p>There are some situations when your employer can dismiss you fairly.</p>

<h2>Not being able to do your job properly</h2>
<p>You may not be able to do your job properly if, for example, you:</p>

<ul>
<li>haven’t been able to keep up with important changes to your job - eg a new computer system</li>
  <li>can’t get along with your colleagues</li>
</ul>
<p>Before taking any action, your employer should:</p>

<ul>
<li>follow disciplinary procedures - eg warn you that your work isn’t satisfactory</li>
  <li>give you a chance to improve - eg by training you</li>
</ul>
<h2>Illness</h2>
<p>You can be dismissed if you have a persistent or long-term illness that makes it impossible for you to do your job.</p>

<p>Before taking any action, your employer should:</p>

<ul>
<li>look for ways to support you - eg considering whether the job itself is making you sick and needs changing</li>
  <li>give you reasonable time to recover from your illness</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a disability (which may include long-term illness), your employer has a legal duty to <a href="/rights-disabled-person/employment" title="Employment rights if you're disabled">support disability in the workplace</a>.</p>

<p>Dismissal because of a disability may be unlawful discrimination.</p>

<h2>Redundancy</h2>
<p>Redundancy is a form of dismissal and is fair in most cases.</p>

<p>If the reason you are selected for <a href="/redundant-your-rights" title="Redundancy">redundancy</a> is unfair then you will have been unfairly dismissed.</p>

<h2>Summary dismissal</h2>
<p>You can be dismissed for ‘gross misconduct’ without your employer going through the normal disciplinary procedures.  This can happen if, for example, you’re violent towards a colleague, customer or property.</p>

<p>Your employer should always investigate the circumstances before making a dismissal, even in possible gross misconduct cases.</p>

<h2>A ‘statutory restriction’</h2>
<p>You can be dismissed if continuing to employ you would break the law - eg if you’re a driver in a lorry firm and you lose your driving licence.</p>

<h2>It’s impossible to carry on employing you</h2>
<p>If it’s impossible to carry on employing you, it’s likely to be fair. For example, if a factory burns down and it’s no longer possible to employ anyone.</p>

<h2>A ‘substantial reason’</h2>
<p>You may be dismissed fairly if, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>you unreasonably refuse to accept a company reorganisation that changes your employment terms</li>
  <li>you’re sent to prison</li>
</ul></article><article id="unfair-and-constructive-dismissal"><header><h1>Part 3: Unfair and constructive dismissal</h1>
  </header><p>In certain situations, you may be able to take legal action if you’re dismissed.</p>

<h2>Unfair dismissal</h2>
<p>Your dismissal could be unfair if your employer doesn’t:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a good reason for dismissing you</li>
  <li>follow the company’s formal disciplinary or dismissal process (or the statutory minimum dismissal procedure in Northern Ireland)</li>
</ul>
<p>Situations when your dismissal is likely to be unfair include if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>asked for flexible working</li>
  <li>refused to give up your working time rights - eg to take rest breaks</li>
  <li>resigned and gave the correct <a href="/handing-in-your-notice-resigning-leaving-job" title="Handing in your notice">notice period</a>    </li>
  <li>joined a <a href="/join-trade-union" title="Trade unions">trade union</a>
</li>
  <li>took part in legal industrial action that lasted 12 weeks or less</li>
  <li>needed time off for jury service</li>
  <li>applied for maternity, paternity and adoption leave</li>
  <li>were on any maternity, paternity and adoption leave you’re entitled to</li>
  <li>tried to enforce your right to receive Working Tax Credits</li>
  <li>exposed wrongdoing in the workplace (<a href="/whistleblowing/dismissals-and-whistleblowing" title="dismissals and whistleblowing">whistleblowing</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Constructive dismissal</h2>
<p>Constructive dismissal is when you’re forced to leave your job against your will because of your <strong>employer’s</strong> conduct.</p>

<p>The reasons you leave your job must be serious, for example, they:</p>

<ul>
<li>don’t pay you or suddenly demote you for no reason</li>
  <li>force you to accept unreasonable changes to how you work - eg tell you to work night shifts when your contract is only for day work</li>
  <li>let other employees harass or bully you</li>
</ul>
<p>Your employer’s breach of contract may be one serious incident or a series of incidents that are serious when taken together.</p>

<p>You should try and sort any issues out by speaking to your employer to solve the dispute.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you do have a case for constructive dismissal, you should leave your job immediately - your employer may argue that, by staying, you accepted the conduct or treatment.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="what-to-do-if-youre-dismissed"><header><h1>Part 4: What to do if you're dismissed</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re threatened with dismissal (or are dismissed) you can get help from a third party to solve the issue by mediation, conciliation and arbitration.</p>

<p>If you’re a member of a trade union, you can also speak to your union representative.</p>

<h2>Employment tribunals</h2>
<p>If you’ve been unable to solve a problem between you and your employer, you can normally go to an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment tribunals">employment tribunal.</a> In Northern Ireland, you would go to an industrial tribunal.</p>

<h3>Qualifying period to claim unfair dismissal</h3>
<p>You must have worked for your employer for a minimum period before you qualify for the right to claim unfair dismissal at a tribunal. If you’re classed as an <a href="/employment-status" title="Employment status">employee</a> and started your job: </p>

<ul>
<li>on or after 6 April 2012 - the qualifying period is normally 2 years  </li>
  <li>before 6 April 2012 - the qualifying period is normally one year</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>In Northern Ireland, the qualifying period is still normally one year.</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>In unfair dismissal claims you must make the claim to a tribunal within 3 months of being dismissed.</p>
