<h2 id="uk-depleted-uranium-policy-and-development">UK depleted uranium policy and development</h2>

<p>UK policy is that depleted uranium (<abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr>) can be used in weapons because it would be wrong to deny our Armed Forces a legitimate and effective capability that can help them achieve their objectives as quickly and safely as possible. Claims of serious health and environmental effects by a very small number of people attract media attention but are disputed by most scientists and international agencies. Whether other countries use <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions or not is a matter for them.</p>

<p><abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> is a heavy metal 70% more dense than lead and with the ability to self-sharpen on impact with armour. This makes it ideal for use in armour-piercing ammunition and reduces the combat risk to UK tank crews as it allows them to engage an enemy from greater distances. It was always recognised that the risks and benefits from using <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions needed to take account of the fact that <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> is toxic in high doses and weakly radioactive. Risk assessments show very little or no chemical or radiation risk to most troops and civilians and instructions are provided to reduce the already low risk as far as is reasonably practicable.</p>

<p>One of the earliest assessments of the risks of using <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions was by the US in 1974. The UK benefited from this work when they began their own <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions development in 1979. Since then the US have completed a major piece of research (known as Capstone) and many other independent organisations have published their findings.</p>

<p>Reports by the Royal Society, European Commission, United Nations Environment Programme, International Atomic Energy Agency and World Health Organisation are on the world wide web. Although some of these were produced some time ago, more recent work shows their conclusions are still valid. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and European Commission summaries were published in 2009 and 2010 respectively.</p>

<p>UK development was at Eskmeals in Cumbria and Kirkcudbright in Dumfries and Galloway. Safety arrangements were discussed with health and safety and environmental protection regulators before test firing began. Personal and environmental monitoring confirms that the original development work and subsequent small-scale firings to ensure the continuing safety and serviceability of the ammunition do not present a hazard to anyone.</p>

<p>None of the highly publicised European Parliament or <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> resolutions calling for more research or a ban on <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions affect the information provided above. The UK opposes such resolutions because <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> has not been shown to have, and indeed is very unlikely to have, any significant impact on the local population or veterans.</p>

<p>Use of <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions is not prohibited under current or likely future international agreements and international concern is not as great as some suggest. Only 15 countries contributed to a <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> report published in 2008 and only 4 suggested the possibility of widespread or extreme health risks. Canada and the Netherlands opposed a <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions ban. A review carried out in accordance with Article 36 of the First Protocol of 1977 Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (Additional Protocol I) concluded that the UK’s only <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munition (CHARM 3) is capable of being used lawfully in international armed conflict.</p>

<p>Allegations about ‘increasing evidence’ of extreme health risks are untrue. There has been nothing to affect the most recent (2008) International Commission on Radiological Protection conclusion that, although the body of information on the health effects of radiation has expanded since 1990, there are few significant changes to our understanding.</p>

<p>Misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the significance of various resolutions, legal processes and research have been used to suggest that the UK government position is flawed. The Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>)’s response to the outcome of a recent Coroner’s Inquest into a death alleged to have been caused by <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> exposure is in the National Archive. This explains that the weight of independent scientific opinion supports the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> position rather than the Jury’s verdict and why, having examined the Coroner’s recommendations, inquest transcript and scientific evidence, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> does not accept the recommendations arising from the Inquest.</p>

<p>Suggestions that doses from the ‘photoelectric effect’ are important and being ignored are shown to be in error by recent peer-reviewed work which shows that ‘photoelectric effect’ doses are broadly comparable with natural background radiation levels and hence of no practical significance in the calculation of radiation risk.</p>

<h2 id="du-munitions-health-monitoring">
<abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions health monitoring</h2>

<p>There is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to suggest that <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> has been responsible for ill-health in UK Forces’ personnel or civilians. However the government will carefully consider any emerging data. Epidemiological studies suggesting <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr>-induced cancers and birth defects have flaws and the people proven to have the highest <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> exposures, ie those in or on vehicles when they were hit by <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions, do not have any <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr>-related health effects.</p>

<p>There are ongoing studies of the health of a group of US veterans known to have been exposed to <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> during the 1991 Gulf conflict. The most recent report of this work was published in 2011.</p>

<p>Veterans with embedded <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> fragments excrete elevated concentrations of uranium but no significant evidence of clinically important changes are observed in kidney or bone. These are the two principal target organs for any form of uranium. Continued surveillance is recommended due to ongoing mobilization of <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> from the embedded <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> fragments.</p>

<h2 id="du-munitions-environmental-monitoring">
<abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions environmental monitoring</h2>

<p>UK surveys in areas where <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions were used have not shown <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> at levels likely to have any detectable health impact. There are only some very limited and localised areas, such as in armoured vehicles hit by <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions, where precautions to prevent <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> inhalation would be sensible if long-term exposures were likely. Similar results have been found by independent international bodies.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> carries out terrestrial and marine environmental monitoring surveys on and around the firing ranges where <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions were developed. Air sampling is also carried out when firing is in progress. The survey methods are agreed with environmental regulators. A summary of the terrestrial and marine results was published in 2002. Subsequent results are in complete agreement with the early findings.</p>

<p>There have been <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> surveys in Kosovo, Bosnia and southern Iraq. The results and conclusions are consistent with work by the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Environment Programme in the Balkans and by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Kuwait. Information has been provided to assist the civilian administration and international relief agencies in carrying out any monitoring they might wish to undertake.</p>

<abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions personal monitoring</h2>

<p>Of the thousands of troops monitored worldwide, very few have had any detectable <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> exposure and the vast majority of these were in or on vehicles when they were attacked with <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr>. Monitoring is also available for personnel concerned about possible <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> exposures.</p>

<p>No <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> has been detected in the vast majority (more than 99.5%) of the almost 1000 UK veterans tested by collection and analysis of urine samples. <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> was only detected in a very small number of veterans who were in or on vehicles when they were attacked with <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions and this <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> is at levels at which no adverse health effects are expected. Similar results have been obtained by other countries.</p>

<p>UK monitoring is based on independent advice from the <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> Oversight Board (<abbr title="DU Oversight Board">DUOB</abbr>) who state that their testing is sufficiently sensitive to detect a <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> exposure that would have ‘material implications for health’. The <abbr title="DU Oversight Board">DUOB</abbr> comprised expert members from a variety of medical and scientific institutions and lay members. Veterans and <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> were represented and nominated their own scientific advisors.</p>

<p>A report of the work can be accessed below. Some key points of test result interpretation and risk modelling were disputed by a small minority of <abbr title="DU Oversight Board">DUOB</abbr> members who produced a minority statement within the main report. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> accept the majority view that this statement is ‘seriously flawed scientifically’. The care needed to obtain meaningful analysis results was shown by <abbr title="DU Oversight Board">DUOB</abbr> work and is the subject of a peer-reviewed scientific article.</p>

<h2 id="uk-depleted-uranium-use">UK depleted uranium use</h2>

<p>When a <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> round impacts on a hard surface, some dust is released. This can be a health hazard in some circumstances. However, all the research to date indicates that these circumstances are extremely unlikely to occur, and, if they do, will only affect very small groups who will be at much greater risk from the other hazards associated with armed conflict. Recent work - including the monitoring of veterans and battlefields - confirms this. The UK used very limited quantities (less than 2.9 tonnes) of <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> in two armed conflicts in 1991 and 2003.</p>

<p>The only use of <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions in peacetime is in test firings. In conflict, 120 mm anti-tank <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions (known as CHARM) and 20 mm <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> rounds used in the Royal Navy’s PHALANX Close-In Weapon System (a system for defending against missile attacks) were fired in the Gulf in 1991 and 2003. The total weight of <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> in the munitions was less than 2.9 tonnes. Use of <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> in PHALANX ended in 2005, leaving the anti-tank round as the UK’s only <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munition.</p>

<p>Clean-up after a conflict is a matter for a country’s civilian administration but UK Forces provide information through signs and leaflets of the explosive or other risks associated with touching any battlefield debris. They also assist with ordnance disposal which includes removal of surface-lying <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> fragments.</p>

<p>The UK has, and will continue to, provide help and advice to assist the civilan administration and relief agencies in carrying out any monitoring they want to undertake. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has provided information on its use of <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> munitions and on its monitoring in Iraq in 2003. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> officials participated at a UNEP seminar at which <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> matters, including environmental monitoring and sampling techniques, were discussed with Iraqi scientists.</p>

<p>More recently, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> provided Iraqi scientists with protective equipment to carry out <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> contamination surveys and with information on the composition of the <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> used in UK munitions. Both the World Health Organisation and International Atomic Energy Agency state that <abbr title="depleted uranium">DU</abbr> risks can be controlled with simple countermeasures conducted by national authorities.</p>
