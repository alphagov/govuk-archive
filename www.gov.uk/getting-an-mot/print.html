  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="the-mot-test"><header><h1>Part 1: The MOT test</h1>
  </header><p>If you drive a vehicle on the road you must keep it in a roadworthy condition. The MOT test checks that your vehicle meets road safety and environmental standards.  </p>

<p>It isn’t the same as having your vehicle serviced and doesn’t check its general mechanical condition.</p>

<p>The leaflet ‘Your car and the MOT’ includes a list of the parts of your vehicle that will be tested.</p>

</div>

<h2>When to test</h2>

<p>You must get an MOT test every year once your vehicle is 3 years old (1 year in some cases - check the <a href="/getting-an-mot/mot-test-fees" title="MOT fees table">MOT fees table</a> to see when).</p>

<p>You can then renew your MOT up to a month before it expires. The earliest date you can get your vehicle tested is printed on the pass certificate.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To get your MOT you need to use an approved MOT test centre. Only centres showing the blue sign with 3 white triangles can carry out your MOT.</p>
</div>

<p>Approved centres must show an official ‘MOT Test: Fees and Appeals’ poster on a public notice board on their premises.  This must list contact details for your local <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> area office.</p>

<h2>If your MOT has expired</h2>

<p>If your MOT has expired you can’t drive your vehicle on the road until it’s passed the test. You could be prosecuted if caught.</p>

<p>The only exception is if you’ve already booked an MOT and are driving your vehicle to the test centre.</p>


</article><article id="after-the-test"><header><h1>Part 2: After the test</h1>
  </header><h2>If your vehicle passes the test</h2>

<p>If your vehicle passes the test you’ll get an MOT certificate and your test record will be entered onto the secure central MOT database.</p>

<h2>If your vehicle fails the test</h2>

<p>If your vehicle fails the test you’ll get a ‘notification of failure’ from the test centre. The failure will be recorded in the secure central MOT database. </p>

<p>Until it passes a retest, you can only drive your vehicle:</p>

<ul>
<li>to a pre-arranged appointment at a garage to have the repairs done</li>
  <li>to a pre-arranged MOT test appointment</li>
</ul>
<p>Your vehicle should be <a href="/getting-an-mot/retests" title="Retests">retested</a> at the same test centre which did the original test.</p>

</article><article id="retests"><header><h1>Part 3: Retests</h1>
  </header><p>Your vehicle may be able to have a partial retest for free or reduced fee in the following cases.</p>

<h2>Leaving your vehicle at the test centre</h2>

<p>If the vehicle is left at the test centre for repair and retested before the end of 10 working days following the day it originally failed, then only a partial retest is needed. There is no fee.</p>

<h2>Bringing your vehicle back to the test centre</h2>

<h3>Before the end of the next working day</h3>

<p>You won’t have to pay again if the vehicle is brought back to the same test centre before the end of the next working day for a partial retest on one or more of the following items only:</p>

<ul>
<li>bonnet</li>
  <li>bootlid</li>
  <li>brake pedal antislip</li>
  <li>direction indicators</li>
  <li>doors</li>
  <li>dropsides</li>
  <li>fuel filler cap</li>
  <li>hazard warning</li>
  <li>horn</li>
  <li>lamps (excluding headlamp aim)</li>
  <li>loading door</li>
  <li>mirrors</li>
  <li>rear reflectors</li>
  <li>registration plates</li>
  <li>seatbelts (excluding body around anchorage points)</li>
  <li>seats</li>
  <li>sharp edges or projections</li>
  <li>steering wheel</li>
  <li>tailboard</li>
  <li>tailgate</li>
  <li>towbars (excluding body around anchorage points)</li>
  <li>vehicle identification number (VIN)</li>
  <li>windscreen and glass</li>
  <li>windscreen wipers</li>
  <li>windscreen washers</li>
  <li>wheels and tyres (excluding motorbikes and motorbikes with sidecar)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bringing your vehicle back within 10 working days</h3>

<p>If the vehicle is removed from the test centre for repair and returned within 10 working days following the day it originally failed, then only a partial retest is needed. In this case a partial retest fee may be charged.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>In all other cases, you’ll need to get a full retest and pay the full MOT fee again.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="mot-test-fees"><header><h1>Part 4: MOT test fees</h1>
  </header><p>The MOT test fee depends on the type of vehicle. The fees shown are the maximum a test centre can charge and aren’t subject to <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>

</article><article id="problems-with-your-test-result"><header><h1>Part 5: Problems with your test result</h1>
  </header><h2>Appealing against a failed test</h2>

<p>If your vehicle fails its MOT, you need to discuss your test results with the test centre <strong>before</strong> anyone starts repairs.</p>

<p>You can appeal a failed test result by filling in an appeal form ‘VT17’. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/repository/Notice%20of%20Appeal%20(VT17).pdf" title="download form VT17 (PDF, 66KB)">download form VT17 (PDF, 66KB)</a> or get it from any MOT test centre or by calling:</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Vehicle Operator Standards Agency (VOSA)</strong><br>
0300 123 9000</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Your appeal must be received within 14 working days of the  test.</p>
</div>

<p>VOSA will then offer you an appointment within 5 days to recheck your vehicle and you’ll need to pay the full test fee again.</p>

<p>If your appeal is successful, then some or all of the test fee will be refunded to you.</p>

<h2>If you think your car has passed incorrectly</h2>

<p>Contact your local VOSA office as soon as possible - you can find the address from your MOT test station or by calling <strong>0300 123 9000</strong>.</p>

<p>If your complaint is accepted, you’ll get an appointment within 5 working days to recheck your vehicle for free as long as:</p>

<ul>
<li>no more than 3 months has passed since the MOT test if it’s a corrosion-related problem</li>
  <li>no more than 28 days has passed for other defects </li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll get an inspection report listing any vehicle defects and advisory items.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>VOSA can’t help you take action against an MOT test centre even if it later decides to take its own action against the centre. You can take your own action against a test centre through Trading Standards, personal legal proceedings or reporting the centre to the police.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you think your MOT certificate isn’t genuine</h2>

<p>Verify that your MOT certificate is genuine online by checking its <a href="/check-mot-status-vehicle" title="MOT status">MOT status</a>.</p>

<h2>If you’re unhappy with your MOT service</h2>

</article><article id="replacing-a-lost-or-damaged-mot-certificate"><header><h1>Part 6: Replacing a lost or damaged MOT certificate</h1>
  </header><p>If you’ve lost or damaged your MOT certificate, you can get a duplicate from any MOT testing station.</p>

<p>You’ll need to give the vehicle registration number and either the original MOT test number, or V5C document reference number - this is on the V5C registration certificate.</p>

<p>The maximum fee for a duplicate certificate is £10, or half the full MOT test fee, whichever is lowest.</p>

</article><article id="vehicles-exempt-from-mot"><header><h1>Part 7: Vehicles exempt from MOT</h1>
  </header><p>Some vehicles don’t have to take an MOT test. These include tractors, goods vehicles powered by electricity and any vehicle less than 3 years old.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>From 18 November 2012 car and motorbikes made before 1960 also won’t need an MOT.</p>

</article><article id="mot-text-reminder-service"><header><h1>Part 8: MOT text reminder service</h1>
  </header><p>If you register for the MOT text reminder service you’ll get messages telling you when your MOT is due.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you don’t get a text for whatever reason, you can’t use this as an excuse for not getting your vehicle tested on time.</p>
</div>

<h2>How the service works</h2>

<p>Once you’re registered you’ll get 3 text reminders to your mobile phone to remind you of your MOT date. </p>

<p>The text reminder only tells you your final MOT due date. You can still renew your MOT up to 1 month before it expires.</p>

<p>The messages will be sent:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 weeks before</li>
  <li>2 weeks before</li>
  <li>the day before</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll get a 4th message once the vehicle’s passed its MOT to remind you to register again for the next MOT test reminder.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your registration can’t be transferred to another vehicle or different mobile phone number.</p>
</div>

<h2>How much it costs</h2>

<p>There’s a one-off charge of <strong>£1.50</strong>, which is collected through your mobile phone network provider once your registration is accepted.</p>

<h2>What you’ll need to use this service</h2>

<p>You’ll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>a UK registered mobile phone</li>
  <li>a UK registered vehicle</li>
  <li>the vehicle’s latest MOT test number</li>
  <li>to be able to incur charges on the mobile phone or have the bill payer’s permission</li>
</ul>
<p>Check you’ve got enough credit if you’re using a pay-as-you-go phone and make sure there is room in your text message inbox for new messages.</p>

<h2>How to register</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Text your MOT test number to <strong>66848 (MOT4U)</strong> from your mobile phone.</p>
</div>

<p>The MOT test number has 12 digits and is in the top left corner of your MOT test certificate (VT20).</p>

<p>You’ll be sent a message to say if you’ve registered successfully or not. If the information you send doesn’t match with the vehicle record, or payment can’t be taken (for example, if you’ve not got enough credit on your phone) then you won’t be able to register and you won’t be charged.  </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can register as many vehicles as you want on the same phone, or register the same vehicle on different phones for £1.50 each time.</p>
</div>

<h2>How long your registration lasts</h2>

<p>Your registration will last for up to 13 months, and once your vehicle passes an MOT test or the due date for your MOT test passes, you’ll stop getting reminder messages.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>When your vehicle passes its MOT test you will need to register and pay again for the service.</p>
</div>

<h2>Cancelling your registration</h2>

<p>You can cancel your registration at any time by sending a STOP text message to <strong>66848 (MOT4U)</strong>.</p>

<p>If you cancel within 7 working days of successfully registering you can get a refund as long as you haven’t been sent your 1st reminder text message.</p>

<p>To get a refund, send the following details to VOSA (Vehicle and Operator Services Agency) by email or post:</p>

<ul>
<li>your full name</li>
  <li>full postal address</li>
  <li>contact telephone number</li>
  <li>vehicle registration number</li>
  <li>current MOT test number</li>
</ul>
<div class="contact">

</div>

<p>You’ll get your refund by cheque within 30 days of a correctly submitted email or letter being received.</p>

<h2>If you change your number plate</h2>

<p>If you change your vehicle number plate (for example, get a personalised number) your MOT reminder text messages may refer to your old number plate.</p>
