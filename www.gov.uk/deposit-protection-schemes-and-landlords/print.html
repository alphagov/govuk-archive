  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>In England and Wales, if you rent out your home on an <a href="/tenancy-agreements/tenancy-types" title="Tenancy types">assured shorthold tenancy</a> that started after 6 April 2007, you must place your tenants’ deposit in 1 of 3 tenancy deposit protection (<abbr title="Tenancy deposit protection">TDP</abbr>) schemes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.depositprotection.com" title="Deposit Protection Service">Deposit Protection Service</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.mydeposits.co.uk/" title="MyDeposits">MyDeposits</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.tds.gb.com/" title="Tenancy Deposit Scheme">Tenancy Deposit Scheme</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These government-backed schemes ensure your tenants will get their deposit back if they:</p>

<ul>
<li>meet the terms of your tenancy agreement</li>
  <li>don’t damage the property</li>
  <li>pay the rent and bills</li>
</ul>
<p>You (or your letting agent) must put your tenants’ deposit in the scheme within 30 days of getting it.</p>

<h2>At the end of the tenancy</h2>

<p>If you and your tenants agree how much deposit they’ll get back, it must be returned to your tenants within 10 days of the tenancy ending.</p>

<p>If you’re in a dispute with your tenants, the deposit is protected in the <abbr title="Tenancy deposit protection">TDP</abbr> until the issue is settled.</p>

<h2>Holding deposits</h2>

<p>If you’ve received a holding deposit from your future tenants (money to ‘hold’ a property before an agreement is signed), you don’t have to protect it. However, once they become tenants the holding deposit becomes a deposit, and you must protect it.</p>

<h2>Deposits made by a third party</h2>

<p>You must use a <abbr title="Tenancy deposit protection">TDP</abbr> scheme even if the deposit is paid by someone else, like a rent deposit scheme or a tenant’s parents.</p>

<h2>Scotland and Northern Ireland</h2>
<p>Scotland has its own system of <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/Housing/privaterent/government/SGTD1" title="Scottish government - safeguarding tenancy deposits">tenant deposit protection.</a></p>

<p>In Northern Ireland, there is currently no official system for protecting tenant deposits. Find out more on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nihe.gov.uk/index/advice/renting_privately/advice_landlords/rent_and_deposits_landlord.htm" title="Housing Executive - your legal obligations regarding rent and deposits">Housing Executive website.</a></p>


</article><article id="information-you-must-give-to-your-tenants"><header><h1>Part 2: Information you must give to your tenants</h1>
  </header><p>Within 30 days of getting their deposit, you must tell your tenants:</p>

<ul>
<li>the address of the rented property</li>
  <li>how much deposit they’ve paid</li>
  <li>how the deposit is protected</li>
  <li>the name and contact details of the tenancy deposit protection (<abbr title="Tenancy deposit protection">TDP</abbr>) scheme and its dispute resolution service</li>
  <li>your (or your letting agency’s) name and contact details</li>
  <li>the name and contact details of any third party who paid the deposit</li>
  <li>why you would keep some or all of the deposit - eg because your tenants damaged the property and you need to fix it</li>
  <li>how to apply to get the deposit back at the end of the tenancy</li>
  <li>what to do if they can’t get hold of you at the end of the tenancy</li>
  <li>what to do if there’s a dispute over the amount of deposit to be returned at the end of the tenancy</li>
</ul></article><article id="if-you-dont-protect-your-tenants-deposit"><header><h1>Part 3: If you don't protect your tenants' deposit</h1>
  </header><p>Your tenants can apply to a county court if you don’t use a tenancy deposit protection (<abbr title="Tenancy deposit protection">TDP</abbr>) scheme when you have to. They can do this at any time during the tenancy.</p>

<p>If the court finds you haven’t protected the deposit, it can order you to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>repay it to your tenants</li>
  <li>pay it into a custodial <abbr title="Tenancy deposit protection">TDP</abbr> scheme’s bank account within 14 days</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The court may also order you to repay your tenants up to 3 times their original deposit within 14 days of making the order.</p>
</div>

<h2>At the end of the tenancy</h2>

<p>If you don’t use a <abbr title="Tenancy deposit protection">TDP</abbr> scheme when you have to, the court may decide that your tenants don’t have to leave the property when the tenancy ends.</p>


</article><article id="disputes"><header><h1>Part 4: Disputes</h1>
  </header><p>If you disagree with your tenants about how much deposit should be returned, your tenancy deposit protection scheme offers a free dispute resolution service.</p>

<p>The Deposit Protection Service has published a guide that gives advice about all 3 schemes. </p>
