  </header><p>You’ll need planning permission from your local planning authority (<abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>) if you want to develop land or buildings.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> is usually your local council. In national parks the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> is the national park authority.</p>

</div>

<p>You may need planning permission for:</p>

<ul>
<li>constructing or changing buildings</li>
  <li>changing the use of land or buildings</li>
  <li>demolishing some buildings</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>give you planning permission (possibly with conditions)</li>
  <li><a href="if-your-applications-turned-down" title="Planning permission: your application's turned down">turn you down</a></li>
</ul></article><article id="do-you-need-planning-permission"><header><h1>Part 2: Do you need planning permission?</h1>
  </header><p>It’s your responsibility to check with <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/wps/portal/genpub_LocalInformation?docRef=LocalInformation&amp;scope=202&amp;langid=0" title="Planning Portal: find your local planning authority">your local planning authority (<abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>)</a> if you need planning permission before you start any development.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The <a href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/permission/house" title="Planning Portal: interactive house" rel="external">interactive house</a> shows you what planning permission you may need for different projects around your home.</p>
</div>

<p>Smaller building works don’t usually need planning permission, as long as you meet certain conditions. These smaller projects include:</p>

<ul>
<li>extensions</li>
  <li>conservatories</li>
  <li>loft conversions</li>
  <li>sheds </li>
</ul>
<p>These are called ‘permitted developments’. Some <abbr title="local planning authorities">LPAs</abbr> may <strong>not</strong> allow this, though, in which case you still need to apply for planning permission.</p>

<p>You might <strong>not</strong> have permitted development rights if you live in:</p>

<ul>
<li>a listed building </li>
  <li>a conservation area</li>
  <li>a national park</li>
  <li>an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</li>
  <li>the Norfolk or Suffolk Broads</li>

<p>Different <abbr title="local planning authorities">LPAs</abbr> can ask you for different <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/" title="Planning Portal: what to submit">documents to support your application.</a> However, you always need:</p>

<ul>
<li>a site location plan (showing the proposed development in relation to surrounding properties)</li>

</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Planning officers at your local council can check if you have all the documents you need to apply. Some councils charge for this service.</p>
</div>

<h2>Application fee</h2>
<p>You have to pay a fee for most planning applications. The amount depends on your application. </p>

<p>You can use an online calculator to work out fees in <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/PpApplications/genpub/en/StandaloneFeeCalculator" title="Planning portal: fee calculator for England">England</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/PpApplications/genpub/en/StandaloneFeeCalculator?isWelsh=true" title="Planning portal: fee calculator for Wales">Wales.</a></p>

<h2>Letting someone else handle your application</h2>
<p>If you don’t want to handle the application yourself, you can ask your agent, architect, solicitor or builder to do it for you.</p>

  </header><ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The Planning Portal sends your application to the local planning authority (<abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> checks your application and makes it public to let other people comment on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> approves or <a href="if-your-applications-turned-down" title="Planning permission: your application's turned down">refuses</a> your application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Only start your building work after the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> tells you that you have planning permission.</p>
</div>

<p>The <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> will try to decide your application within 8 weeks. If it needs longer, it will usually write to you and ask for an extension. This might happen if your building project is complex or affects lots of people. </p>

</article><article id="if-your-applications-turned-down"><header><h1>Part 5: Your application’s turned down</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re refused planning permission, ask your local planning authority (<abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>) why. You can then make changes to your application and send it in again. </p>

<p>As a last resort, if you think the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>’s decision is unreasonable, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/appeals/online/makeanappeal" title="Planning Portal: make an appeal">appeal.</a></p>


</article><article id="commenting-on-planning-applications"><header><h1>Part 6: Commenting on planning applications</h1>
  </header><p>All building projects that need planning permission must be made public. You can look at the plans and comment on them. </p>

<p>The local planning authority (<abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>) will post notices near the building site and/or write letters to people who live nearby to ask if they agree with the plans.</p>

<p>For large projects, like a school or supermarket, the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> will also put a notice in the local newspaper.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You’ll need to look at the plans and make comments before the deadline set by the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<p>You can also go to council meetings about the development. You can speak in these meetings but you can’t vote on the planning application.</p>

<p>Once the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> has given planning permission for a new development, you can’t change the permission.</p>
