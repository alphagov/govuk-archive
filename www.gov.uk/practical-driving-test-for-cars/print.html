  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>The practical driving test is designed to see if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>can drive safely in different road and traffic conditions</li>
  <li>know the <a href="/highway-code" title="Highway Code">Highway Code</a> and can show this through your driving ability</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as you show the standard required, you’ll pass your driving test. There are no pass or fail quotas.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You’ll need to have passed your <a href="/driving-theory-test" title="driving theory test">driving theory test</a> before taking your practical test.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="documents-to-bring-to-your-test"><header><h1>Part 2: Documents to bring to your test</h1>
  </header><p>You must bring:</p>

<ul>
<li>your theory test pass certificate (or confirmation) if you’re not exempt from taking the theory test</li>
  <li>both parts of your driving licence - the photocard and the paper counterpart</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must take your signed driving licence and a valid passport if you have an old-style paper licence.</p>

</article><article id="what-happens-during-the-test"><header><h1>Part 3: What happens during the test</h1>
  </header><p>Before you start the driving ability part of your test, you’ll have an eyesight check and be asked 2 vehicle safety questions.</p>

<h2>Eyesight check</h2>

<p>You’ll have to read a number plate from a distance of:</p>

<ul>
<li>20 metres for vehicles with a new-style number plate</li>
  <li>20.5 metres for vehicles with an old-style number plate</li>
</ul>
<p>You can write down what you see if you can’t speak English or have difficulty reading.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>New-style number plates start with 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, eg AB51 ABC.</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You’ll fail your driving test and the test won’t continue if you can’t pass the eyesight test.</p>
</div>

<h2>Vehicle safety questions: ‘show me, tell me’</h2>

<p>You’ll be asked 2 vehicle safety questions. These are also known as the ‘show me, tell me’ questions.</p>

<p>The examiner will ask you one ‘show me’ question, where you’ll have to show them how you’d carry out a vehicle safety check.</p>

<p>You’ll also be asked one ‘tell me’ question, where you’ll have to explain to the examiner how you’d carry out the check.</p>

<h2>The driving ability part</h2>

<p>The driving part of your test will last about 40 minutes. Throughout the test your examiner will be looking for an overall safe standard of driving.</p>

<h3>Your general driving ability</h3>

<p>During your test the examiner will give you directions that you should follow. You’ll drive in various road and traffic conditions. You should drive in the way your instructor has trained you.</p>

<p>It should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>normal stops</li>
  <li>an angle start (pulling out from behind a parked vehicle)</li>
  <li>a hill start</li>
</ul>
<p>You might also be asked to carry out an emergency stop.</p>

<h3>Reversing your vehicle safely</h3>

<p>You’ll have to show how well you can reverse your vehicle. The examiner will ask you to do one of the following exercises:</p>

<ul>
<li>reversing around a corner</li>
  <li>turning in the road</li>
  <li>reverse parking - either into a parking bay, or parallel parking at the side of the road</li>
</ul>
<h3>Independent driving section</h3>

<p>Your driving test will include around 10 minutes of <a href="/practical-driving-test-for-cars/independent-driving-section-of-the-test" title="independent driving">independent driving</a>. It’s designed to assess your ability to drive safely while making decisions on your own.</p>

<h3>If you make mistakes</h3>

<p>Carry on if you make a mistake, because if it’s not a serious mistake it might not affect your result.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Your examiner will stop your test if they think your driving is a danger to other road users.</p>
</div>

<h2>Taking someone with you</h2>

<p>Your examiner will ask if you want your instructor, or another person, to:</p>

<ul>
<li>sit in the back of your car during your driving test</li>
  <li>be with you after the test for the result and feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>This person will usually be your driving instructor, but it could also be a relative or friend.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>They must be over 16 and can’t take any part in the test.</p>
</div>

<h2>The examiner’s supervisor</h2>

<p>The examiner’s supervisor may come along as well. They will be watching the examiner’s performance, not yours. The supervisor won’t have any say in how you’re tested or in your result.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Your test might be cancelled and you could lose your fee if you don’t let the examiner’s supervisor go with you.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="independent-driving-section-of-the-test"><header><h1>Part 4: Independent driving section of the test</h1>
  </header><p>Your practical driving test will include around 10 minutes of independent driving. It’s not a test of your orientation and navigation skills.</p>

<h2>How the test works</h2>

<p>During your test you’ll have to drive independently by either following:</p>

<ul>
<li>traffic signs</li>
  <li>a series of directions</li>
  <li>a combination of both</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you understand where you’re going when following verbal directions, the examiner can show you a diagram.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@motor/documents/digitalasset/dg_196536.pdf" title="Download ‘Independent driving route diagram example’ (PDF, 315KB)">Download ‘Independent driving route diagram example’ (PDF, 315KB)</a></p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can’t use sat nav because the independent driving section tests how you make your own decisions.</p>
</div>

<h3>Forgetting the directions</h3>

<p>It doesn’t matter if you don’t remember every direction, or if you go the wrong way.</p>

<p>Driving independently means making your own decisions - this includes deciding when it’s safe and appropriate to ask for confirmation about where you’re going.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The examiner will confirm the directions to you if you ask for a reminder of them.</p>
</div>

<h3>Going off the independent driving route</h3>

<p>It won’t affect the result of your test if you go off the independent driving route, unless you make a driving fault.</p>

<p>The examiner will help you get back on the route if you go off it or take a wrong turning. You can then continue with the independent driving.</p>

<h3>Poor traffic signs</h3>

<p>The examiner will give you directions until you can see the next traffic sign if there are poor or obscured traffic signs. You won’t need to have a detailed knowledge of the area.</p>

</article><article id="your-driving-test-result"><header><h1>Part 5: Your driving test result</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll pass your test if you make:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 or fewer driving faults</li>
  <li>no serious or dangerous faults</li>
</ul>
<p>When the driving test has ended, you can call your instructor over if they didn’t go with you on your test. This is so they can listen to the result and help you with any feedback afterwards.</p>

<p>The examiner will:</p>

<ul>
<li>tell you if you passed or not</li>
  <li>explain how you did during the test</li>
</ul>
<h2>The different types of faults</h2>

<p>There are 3 types of faults that can be marked:</p>

<ul>
<li>a dangerous fault - involves actual danger to you, the examiner, the public or property</li>
  <li>a serious fault - could potentially be dangerous</li>
  <li>a driving fault - not potentially dangerous, but if you make the same fault throughout your test it could become a serious fault</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you pass your test</h2>

<p>The examiner will give you a pass certificate if you pass the test. They will also ask you if you want your full licence to be sent to you automatically.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Once you have passed your test you can start driving straight away - you don’t need to wait for your full licence to arrive.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you don’t pass</h2>

<p>You have to wait another 10 working days before you can take another test if you don’t pass. Working days don’t include Sundays and public holidays.</p>

<h2>Feedback on how eco-efficient your driving is</h2>

<p>The examiner will also give you feedback about how eco-efficient your driving is.</p>

</div>

<h2>Using a hire car</h2>

<p>You can only use a hire car for your test if it is fitted with dual controls and it meets all the other driving test vehicle rules.</p>

<h2>Space-saver tyres</h2>

<p>In some cars the spare tyre is a space-saver and only supposed to be for temporary use. You can’t take your test if a space-saver tyre is in use.</p>

<h2>Electronic parking brakes</h2>

<p>You can use your vehicle for your test if it is fitted with an electronic parking brake.</p>

<h2>Vehicles you can’t use</h2>

<p>Some models of vehicle can’t be used for the test. This is because they don’t give the examiner all-round vision. They are generally convertible cars and panel vans.</p>

<p>You can’t use these cars for a driving test:</p>

<ul>
<li>BMW Mini convertible</li>
  <li>Ford KA convertible</li>
  <li>Toyota iQ</li>
  <li>VW Beetle convertible</li>
</ul>
<p>Other types of convertible car or panel van may also be unsuitable. Check with the Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>) before booking your test.</p>

</table></article><article id="special-needs"><header><h1>Part 9: Special needs</h1>
  </header><p>When you book your practical driving test you should say if you have any special needs or disabilities.</p>

<p>There are a number of facilities to help. You still take the same driving test as everyone else, no matter how serious your disability is. </p>

<h2>Booking your practical driving test</h2>

<p>When you book your test you’ll be asked if you’ll be bringing an interpreter with you.</p>

<p>You’ll also be asked if you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>any condition which affects your movement</li>
  <li>any missing limbs</li>
  <li>any special learning needs</li>
  <li>arthritis</li>
  <li>dyslexia</li>
  <li>epilepsy</li>
  <li>paraplegia</li>
  <li>any other special needs</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also be asked if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>deaf - either profoundly or not</li>
  <li>heavily pregnant</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting more time to take your test</h2>

<p>More time might be allowed for your test if you have certain special needs. It will give the examiner time to talk to you about your disability and any adaptations fitted to your vehicle.</p>

<h2>If English isn’t your first language</h2>

<p>You can bring your own interpreter for your practical driving test. They must be at least 16 years old. Your approved driving instructor can be your interpreter.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll need to arrange your own interpreter and pay any fees that they charge.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you have hearing difficulties</h2>

<p>The examiner will tell you what will happen by using written notes at the start of the test if you are deaf or have hearing difficulties. They will also look at you to help you lip read what they are saying if you find that helpful.</p>

<p>The examiner will usually give directions to you as hand signals. These will be explained and shown to you using written cards before your test starts.</p>

<h3>Taking an interpreter with you</h3>

<p>You can bring your own interpreter for your practical driving test if you use sign language.</p>

<p>They must be at least 16 years old. Your approved driving instructor can be your interpreter.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You will need to arrange your own interpreter and pay any fees that they charge.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you are pregnant</h2>

<p>You can take a driving test at any stage of your pregnancy. However, you must be able and willing to do an emergency stop.</p>

<h2>Taking the eyesight test if you have reading difficulties</h2>

<p>At the start of the practical driving test, you will have an <a href="/driving-eyesight-rules" title="eyesight test">eyesight test</a>. The examiner will ask you to read the number plate on a parked vehicle.</p>

<p>You can write down what you see on the number plate if you have learning difficulties or do not speak English.</p>

<h2>The independent driving section of the test</h2>

<p>Your examiner will know what kinds of reasonable adjustments to make for the <a href="independent-driving-section-of-the-test" title="independent driving">independent driving</a> part of your test if you said you have special needs when you booked your test. </p>

<p>They might ask if you would prefer to follow traffic signs.</p>

  </header><p>Sometimes the Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>) has to cancel or stop driving tests because of bad weather, vehicle problems or other reasons.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your test will usually be automatically rebooked for you at no further cost if it’s cancelled by <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Bad weather</h2>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Practical driving tests are not held in dangerous weather conditions, eg when the roads are icy.</p>
</div>

<p>Call your test centre if there is snow or ice in your local area on the day of your test.</p>

<h3>When to phone your test centre</h3>

<p>You should call the test centre:</p>

<ul>
<li>as soon as you can on the day of your test if it’s booked for early in the morning</li>
  <li>later in the morning if your test is in the afternoon</li>
</ul>
<h3>No answer from the test centre</h3>

<p>If nobody answers the phone, and the conditions in your area aren’t looking too bad, it’s likely that the driving examiners are:</p>

<ul>
<li>checking the local roads to see if driving tests can go ahead</li>
  <li>taking driving tests because the conditions are suitable</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this isn’t a guarantee that your test will go ahead. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Call the test centre again or go there in time for your test.</p>
</div>

<h3>If your test can’t go ahead</h3>

<p>A new appointment date will usually be sent to you within 3 working days. This could take up to 7 days when the bad weather goes on for longer.</p>

<p>You won’t be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

<h3>Waiting times for a practical driving test</h3>

<p>As well as causing cancellations, bad weather can sometimes lead to longer waiting times for practical test appointments.</p>

<h2>Tests cancelled by <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> for other reasons</h2>

<p>You might be able to claim out-of-pocket expenses if your test is cancelled by <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> at short notice.</p>

<p>‘Short notice’ means less than 3 clear working days’ notice. Working days include Saturdays, but don’t include public holidays.</p>

<p>You can’t claim if the test was cancelled because of:</p>

<ul>
<li>bad weather and poor light</li>
  <li>vehicle problems</li>
  <li>driver problems</li>
</ul>
<p>To apply, download the application form and send it to <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Problems with you or your vehicle</h2>

<p>You’ll have to take another test at your own cost if your test can’t be completed because of a problem with:</p>

<ul>
<li>you - for example, if you feel unwell while taking your test</li>
  <li>your vehicle - for example, if it breaks down during the test or is not suitable for the test</li>
