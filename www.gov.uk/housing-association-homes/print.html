  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="apply-for-a-home"><header><h1>Part 1: Apply for a home</h1>
  </header><p>Housing associations offer similar types of housing as local councils – often to people on a low income or who need extra support.</p>

<p>You can apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>directly to a housing association</li>
  <li>often through your <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1" title="Find your local council">local council</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>You can apply to more than one housing association at a time.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Search for a housing association on the <a href="http://portal.tenantservicesauthority.org/" title="Tenant Services Authority" rel="external">Tenant Services Authority</a> website.</p>
</div>

<h2>Waiting list</h2>
<p>Once you apply, you’ll be put on a waiting list.</p>

<p>Housing associations normally offer housing to people most suited to that particular property. You may have to wait a long time for a suitable property to become available.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Housing associations are also known as Registered Social Landlords or Private Registered Providers of Social Housing.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="types-of-tenancy"><header><h1>Part 2: Types of tenancy</h1>
  </header><p>Your rights and responsibilities depend on the type of tenancy you have.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your tenancy agreement is a legal document that tells you all the rules about living in your property.</p>
</div>

<h2>Starter tenancy</h2>
<p>New housing association tenants may be offered a starter tenancy. These usually last 12 months and are like a ‘trial’ period.</p>

<p>You become an assured tenant after 12 months, unless your housing association has either:</p>

<ul>
<li>started action to evict you </li>
  <li>extended your starter tenancy </li>
</ul>
<h2>Assured shorthold tenancy</h2>
<p>You may be offered an assured shorthold tenancy if a long-term tenancy wouldn’t suit you.</p>

<p>The tenancy will usually be for a fixed period. It has to last at least 6 months.</p>

<p>Once the fixed term ends, your housing association may let you carry on living in the property month by month (or week by week if you pay rent weekly). If it does, it can get the property back at 2 months’ notice.</p>

<h2>Assured tenancy</h2>
<p>As an assured tenant, you can normally live in your property for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>You rights may include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="right-to-acquire" title="Housing association homes: Right to Acquire">buying your home</a></li>
  <li>having your home repaired </li>
  <li>swapping your home with another council or housing association tenant</li>
</ul>
<h2>Secure tenancy</h2>
<p>If you became a housing association tenant before 15 January 1989, and are still with the same housing association, you’re likely to be a secure tenant. </p>

<p>You can’t get a secure tenancy if you’re a new resident.</p>

<h2>Joint tenancy</h2>
<p>Joint tenancies are normally offered to married couples and cohabiting partners. </p>

<h2>Ending your tenancy</h2>
<p>Your tenancy can only be ended if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you give the housing association 4 weeks’ notice in writing </li>
  <li>the housing association <a href="/council-housing-association-evictions" title="Council and housing association evictions">evicts</a> you </li>
</ul>
<p>Assured and secure tenancies can also end if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the housing association needs to move you (eg to redevelop your property) – it should offer you a new property and a new assured tenancy </li>
  <li>you transfer your tenancy to someone else or swap homes </li>
</ul></article><article id="right-to-acquire"><header><h1>Part 3: Right to Acquire</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply to buy your housing association home if you’ve lived in properties for 5 years that have a ‘public sector landlord’. These landlords include:</p>

<ul>
<li>councils </li>
  <li>housing associations </li>
  <li>the armed services </li>
  <li>NHS trusts and foundation trusts </li>
</ul>
<h2>Does your property qualify?</h2>
<p>Your property must either have been:</p>

<ul>
<li>built or bought by a housing association from 1 April 1997 onwards </li>
  <li>transferred from a local council to a housing association from 1 April 1997 onwards </li>
</ul>
<p>Your landlord must be registered with the <a rel="external" href="http://portal.tenantservicesauthority.org/" title="Tenant Services Authority">Tenant Services Authority.</a></p>

<p>The home you want to buy must also be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a self-contained property</li>
  <li>your only or main home </li>
</ul>
<h2>Joint applications</h2>
<p>You can make a joint application with:</p>

<ul>
<li>someone who shares your tenancy</li>
  <li>up to 3 family members who’ve lived with you for the past 12 months (even if they don’t share your tenancy)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who doesn’t qualify?</h2>
<p>You can’t use Right to Acquire if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re being made bankrupt </li>
  <li>a court has ordered you to leave your home </li>
  <li>you’re a council tenant – you may be able to use <a href="/right-to-buy" title="Right to Buy">Right to Buy</a> instead</li>
