    <section role="main"><header><h1>Your employment contract:  how it can be changed, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="consultation"><header><h1>Part 1: Consultation</h1>
  </header><p>Usually, you and your employer must agree for a contract to be changed. </p>

<p>If you want to make a change, speak to your employer and explain why. You can’t insist on making changes unless they’re covered by a statutory right (eg not working on a Sunday). </p>

<p>If your employer wants to make changes, they should</p>

<ul>
<li>consult or negotiate with you or your representative (eg from a trade union or staff association)</li>
  <li>explain the reasons why</li>
  <li>listen to alternative ideas you may have</li>
</ul></article><article id="types-of-change"><header><h1>Part 2: Types of change</h1>
  </header><p>If your employer changes any terms in your <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions/written-statement-of-employment-particulars" title="Written statement of employment particulars">written statement</a> with your agreement, they must confirm the change in writing within a month. You must be told exactly what has changed in the statement. </p>

<p>If your employer changes terms and conditions that aren’t in the <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions/written-statement-of-employment-particulars" title="Written statement of employment particulars">written statement</a> (eg like the right to sick leave), they should tell you where to find information about the change (eg a company handbook, noticeboard or intranet site).  </p>

<h2>Collective agreements and changes to written statements</h2>
<p>A <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions/collective-agreements" title="Collective agreements">collective agreement</a> may exist between your employer and trade unions or a staff association. If your employer makes agreed changes to the terms of the collective agreement, they should inform you in writing.</p>

<p>Negotiations under a collective agreement can lead to changes in the terms of your <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions/written-statement-of-employment-particulars" title="Written statement of employment particulars">written statement</a> (eg pay or working hours).  If you are covered by a collective agreement, any changes will apply to you whether you are a member of a union or staff association or not.</p>

<h2>Flexibility clauses</h2>
<p>Flexibility clauses are terms in your contract that give your employer the right to change some of your terms and conditions. A flexibility clause could be that your job location can be changed. </p>

<p>Your employer isn’t allowed to make completely unreasonable changes using a flexibility clause. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> telling you to move to another country to work at 1 day’s notice would be completely unreasonable.</p>
</div>

<h2>Changes of employer</h2>
<p>If your employer changes, usually you must be given a new <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions/written-statement-of-employment-particulars" title="Written statement of employment particulars">written statement of particulars</a> within 2 months.</p>

<p>However, if the name of the business changes or there’s a <a href="/business-transfers-and-takeovers-your-rights/overview" title="Business transfers and takeovers - your rights">new employer</a> but no other changes in terms and conditions, your employer doesn’t need to issue a new written statement. However, they should inform you in writing of the changes within a month.</p>

<h2>Disciplinary measures</h2>
<p>Sometimes changes to your terms and conditions like a demotion can happen as a result of a disciplinary measure. </p>

<p>Your employer should make sure the staff handbook or intranet site contains information about how this could happen in the section dealing with disciplinary procedures.</p>

</article><article id="problems-with-changes"><header><h1>Part 3: Problems with changes</h1>
  </header><p>Problems can arise if: </p>

<ul>
<li>an employer tries to change your contract without agreement or re-employs you on new terms and conditions</li>
  <li>there is a breach of contract where one of the terms in a contract is broken (eg an employer doesn’t pay agreed wages or employees don’t work agreed hours)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Talk to your employer</h2>
<p>If you have a problem over contract changes, try to <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute/overview" title="Solve a workplace dispute">solve</a> things informally by talking to your employer or through <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute/mediation-conciliation-and-arbitration" title="Mediation, conciliation and arbitration">mediation.</a></p>

<p>You can also get advice from your trade union representative (if you’re a member of a union), <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" title="Citizen's Advice">Citizen’s Advice</a> or <abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">ACAS</abbr>. If you live in Northern Ireland you can also get advice from Labour Relations Agency (<abbr title="Labour Relations Agency">LRA</abbr>) .</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">ACAS</abbr> helpline</strong><br>
08457 47 47 47<br>
Monday to Friday 8am to 8pm, Saturday 9am to 1pm</p>
</div>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="Labour Relations Agency">LRA</abbr> helpline</strong><br>
028 9032 1442<br>
Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm</p>
</div>

<h2>Legal action</h2>
<p>If the problem can’t be solved, you may have the right to take legal action. Get advice before you do - legal action can be expensive. If you’re a trade union member, you may be able to get legal advice from your union.  </p>

<h2>Making a change without agreement</h2>
<p>If your employer makes a change to contracts without your agreement (including by using flexibility clauses unreasonably), you may:</p>

<ul>
<li>have the right to refuse to work the new conditions </li>
  <li>say you are working any new terms under protest and you’re treating the change as a breach of contract</li>
  <li>resign and claim <a href="/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal" title="Unfair and constructive dismissal">constructive dismissal</a>
</li>
  <li>be able to take a case to an <a href="/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal" title="Employment tribunals">employment tribunal</a> </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>In Northern Ireland you would take your case to an industrial tribunal.</p>
</div>

<h3>Working new terms and conditions</h3>
<p>If you disagree with new terms and conditions but don’t say or do anything, this may count as agreeing to the changes. </p>

<h2>Re-employment on new terms and conditions</h2>
<p>Employers may, as a last resort, end your contract and re-employ you on new terms and conditions. </p>

<p>Employers who are dismissing employees must follow the legally required:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/redundant-your-rights/20-or-more-redundancies" title="20 or more redundancies">redundancy procedure</a> in England, Wales and Scotland</li>
  <li>statutory minimum dismissal in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>
<p>If your employer does dismiss and re-employ you, you may be able to take a case to a tribunal and claim:</p>

<ul>
<li>breach of contract</li>
  <li><a href="/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal" title="Unfair and constructive dismissal">unfair dismissal</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Breach of contract claims</h2>
<p>If you can’t solve things informally with your employer, you may be able to take a breach of contract case to a civil court, an <a href="/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal" title="Employment tribunals">employment tribunal</a>. If you live in Northern Ireland you can take your case to an industrial tribunal.</p>

<p>If you go to a tribunal, your employer may be able to make a counter-claim. </p>

<p>Claims and counter-claims can only go to a tribunal if they:</p>

<ul>
<li>are related to an employment contract issue</li>
  <li>still haven’t been solved when the employee ends their employment with your company</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the claim or counter-claim mustn’t be related to a personal injury or things like a contract term that deals with <a href="/intellectual-property-an-overview/what-is-intellectual-property" title="What is intellectual property">intellectual property rights.</a> </p>

<h3>Time limits</h3>
<p>Usually, you must make a claim to a tribunal within 3 months of ending your employment at the company. Your employer must make a counter-claim within 6 weeks of receiving a copy of your claim. </p>

<h3>Compensation limits</h3>
<p>If a tribunal agrees with your claim, they may award you compensation. You can only get compensation for financial loss (eg non-payment of wages) in breach of contract claim. The maximum compensation that can be given is £25,000.</p>
