    <section role="main"><header><h1>Changing an employment contract, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="getting-agreement"><header><h1>Part 1: Getting agreement</h1>
  </header><p>If employers want to make changes to an employee’s contract, they must get their agreement. They should:</p>

<ul>
<li>consult or negotiate with employees or their representatives (eg from a trade union or staff association)</li>
  <li>explain the reasons for any changes</li>
  <li>listen to alternative ideas from your their employees</li>
</ul>
<p>If employees want to make changes to their contracts, they should explain the reasons. They can’t insist on making a change unless it’s covered by a statutory right, eg not working on a Sunday.</p>

<p>Once any changes are agreed, the employer needs to <a href="/your-employment-contract-how-it-can-be-changed/making-changes" title="Making changes">confirm them in writing</a> to their employees.</p>

</article><article id="making-changes"><header><h1>Part 2: Making changes</h1>
  </header><p>Once employers have agreed on changes with their staff, they need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>update the terms of their employees’ <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions/written-statement-of-employment-particulars" title="Written statement of employment particulars">‘written statement’</a> of employment conditions</li>
  <li>write to their employees within a month to tell them exactly what has changed</li>
</ul>
<p>If an employer changes terms and conditions that aren’t in the written statement (eg the right to sick leave), they should tell their employees where to find information about the change. This could be in a company handbook, noticeboard or intranet site.</p>

<h2>Collective agreements</h2>

<p>Employers must write to their staff to let them know about any changes to <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions/collective-agreements" title="Collective agreements">collective agreements</a> with trade unions or staff associations.</p>

<p>These changes might affect the terms of employees’ written statements, including pay and working hours, whether or not they’re a member of the union or staff association.</p>

<h2>Flexibility clauses</h2>

<p>Flexibility clauses are terms in a contract that give employers the right to change some conditions of employment, eg relocation.</p>

<p>Employers can only use flexibility clauses to make reasonable changes. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> <br>
An employer couldn’t use a flexibility clause to insist on an employee moving to another country to work with 1 week’s notice.</p>
</div>

<h2>Changes of employer</h2>

<p>If someone starts working for a different employer, they’ll normally have to be given a new written statement within 2 months.</p>

<p>However, if the name of a business changes or there’s a <a href="/business-transfers-takeovers-workers-rights" title="Business transfers and takeovers - your rights">new employer</a> but no other changes in terms and conditions, the employer doesn’t need to issue a new written statement. They still need to write to their staff about the changes within a month.</p>

<h2>Disciplinary measures</h2>

<p>Sometimes changes to an employee’s terms and conditions, like a demotion, can happen as a result of a <a href="/disciplinary-procedures-and-action-at-work" title="Disciplinary procedures">disciplinary measure</a>. </p>

<p>Employers should make sure the staff handbook or intranet site contains information about how this could happen in the section dealing with disciplinary procedures.</p>

</article><article id="dealing-with-problems"><header><h1>Part 3: Dealing with problems</h1>
  </header><p>Problems can arise if: </p>

<ul>
<li>an employer tries to change a contract without agreement, or re-employs someone on new terms and conditions</li>
  <li>there is a breach of contract where one of the terms in a contract is broken (eg an employer doesn’t pay agreed wages or employees don’t work agreed hours)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solving disputes</h2>

<p>If there’s a disagreement over contract changes, employers and their staff should try to <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute/overview" title="Solve a workplace dispute">solve</a> things by talking informally or through <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute/mediation-conciliation-and-arbitration" title="Mediation, conciliation and arbitration">mediation</a>.</p>

<p>Employees can also get advice from their trade union representative (if they’re a member of a union), <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" title="Citizen's Advice">Citizen’s Advice</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/" title="Acas"><abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr></a> (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service). In Northern Ireland, they can get advice from the Labour Relations Agency (<abbr title="Labour Relations Agency">LRA</abbr>) .</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr> helpline</strong><br>
08457 47 47 47<br>
Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm  <br>
Saturday, 9am to 1pm</p>
</div>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="Labour Relations Agency">LRA</abbr> helpline</strong><br>
028 9032 1442<br>
Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm</p>
</div>

<p>If the problem can’t be solved, employers or employees may have the right to take legal action. It’s important to get advice first because legal action can be expensive. If you’re a trade union member, you may be able to get legal advice from your union.  </p>

<h2>Making a change without agreement</h2>

<p>If an employer makes a change to a contract without getting agreement (including by using flexibility clauses unreasonably), employees may:</p>

<ul>
<li>have the right to refuse to work under the new conditions </li>
  <li>say that they’re working any new terms under protest, and are treating the change as a breach of contract</li>
  <li>resign and claim <a href="/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal" title="Unfair and constructive dismissal">constructive dismissal</a>
</li>
  <li>be able to take a case to an <a href="/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal" title="Employment tribunals">employment tribunal</a> </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>In Northern Ireland an employment tribunal is known as an ‘industrial tribunal’.</p>
</div>

<p>If an employee disagrees with new terms and conditions but doesn’t say or do anything, this may count as agreeing to the changes. </p>

<h2>Re-employment on new terms and conditions</h2>
<p>Employers may, as a last resort, end a contract and re-employ someone on new terms and conditions. </p>

<p>Employers who are <a href="/dismissal" title="Dismissal">dismissing employees</a> must follow the legally required:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/redundant-your-rights" title="Redundancy">redundancy procedure</a> in England, Wales and Scotland</li>
  <li>statutory minimum dismissal in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>
<p>If an employer does dismiss and re-employ someone, they may be able to take a case to a tribunal and claim:</p>

<ul>
<li>breach of contract</li>
  <li><a href="/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal" title="Unfair and constructive dismissal">unfair dismissal</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Breach of contract claims</h2>

<p>If an employee claims breach of contract and they can’t solve things informally with their employer, they may be able to take their case to a civil court or an <a href="/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal" title="Employment tribunals">employment tribunal</a> (or an industrial tribunal in Northern Ireland).</p>

<p>Their employer may be able to make a counter-claim. </p>

<p>Claims and counter-claims can only go to a tribunal if they:</p>

<ul>
<li>are related to an employment contract issue</li>
  <li>still haven’t been solved when the employee ends their employment</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The claim or counter-claim can’t be related to a personal injury, or certain types of contract term like <a href="/intellectual-property-an-overview/what-is-intellectual-property" title="What is intellectual property">intellectual property rights</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Time limits</h3>

<p>Usually, employees must make a claim to a tribunal within 3 months of ending their employment. The employer gets 6 weeks from receiving a copy of the claim to decide whether to make a counter-claim. </p>

<h3>Compensation limits</h3>

<p>If the tribunal agrees with the employee’s claim, they may award compensation. This can only be for financial loss (eg non-payment of wages), up to a maximum of £25,000.</p>
