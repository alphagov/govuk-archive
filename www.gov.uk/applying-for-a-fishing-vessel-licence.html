<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If your fishing vessel is registered in the UK you must have a licence to catch sea fish that will be sold. The licensing system ensures that the UK does not exceed its yearly quotas under the European Union Common Fisheries Policy.</p>

<p>To restrict the size of the UK fishing fleet, no new fishing vessel licences are issued. When you license a fishing vessel for the first time you have to obtain one or more suitable existing licence ‘entitlements’ to cover the tonnage and engine power of your vessel. Once the entitlement has been transferred into your name, you can apply for a licence.</p>

<p>This guide tells you how a licence entitlement arises and how to convert it into a licence. It also sets out the additional rules for joint and company applications, and tells you what your licence will look like and how long it is valid for.</p>

<h2 id="fishing-vessel-licences-and-entitlements">Fishing vessel licences and entitlements</h2>

<p>Due to the need to restrict the size of the UK fishing fleet, no new fishing vessel licences are issued. Before you can license a vessel you have to obtain one or more existing licence entitlements suitable for your vessel.</p>

<p>A licence entitlement is created when a licence is no longer attached to an active fishing vessel. This can occur when a vessel:</p>

<ul>
<li>is sold with or without its licence</li>
  <li>sinks</li>
  <li>is scrapped</li>
  <li>is otherwise deregistered</li>
</ul>
<p>If the boat you purchase comes with a licence attached to it, an entitlement will be created from that licence which you can use to licence the vessel in your name. But if it doesn’t have a licence attached to it, you need to acquire an entitlement from somewhere else.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-suitable-licence-entitlement-for-my-vessel">What is a suitable licence entitlement for my vessel?</h3>

<p>For licensing purposes there are a number of key characteristics to define the fishing capacity of your vessel. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>tonnage measurement</li>
  <li>engine power in kilowatts</li>
</ul>
<p>When you obtain one or more licence entitlements to license your vessel you must make sure that the tonnage and engine power are enough to cover your vessel. Although the Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) doesn’t get involved in commercial transactions, they can advise you on suitable entitlements. But you are still responsible for making sure that entitlements you buy meet your requirements.</p>

<h2 id="converting-an-entitlement-to-a-licence">Converting an entitlement to a licence</h2>

<p>You have to apply for a licence entitlement to be transferred into your name before you can convert it into a fishing vessel licence. The local Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) office will check that the current licence holder is happy to surrender the entitlement before transferring it to you.</p>

<p>You apply to have an entitlement transferred by completing sections A and B of form AFL7 ‘Establishment or transfer of an entitlement and transfer of a licence’ and sending it to the local <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> office that currently administers the licence. The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will return the completed AFL7 showing you as the entitlement holder.</p>

<h3 id="converting-the-entitlement-to-a-vessel-licence">Converting the entitlement to a vessel licence</h3>

<p>To convert your entitlement to a licence you need to complete form AFL2 ‘Application for a fishing licence for a British registered fishing vessel’. Send the completed form to your local <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> office together with:</p>

<ul>
<li>your valid certificate of registry for the vessel - see guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/fishing-vessel-licences">fishing vessel licences</a>
</li>
  <li>the completed form AFL7 showing you as the entitlement holder</li>
</ul>
<p>You must send the original documents, not copies. Your local <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> office will try to process your application within five working days.</p>

<h3 id="capacity-penalties">Capacity penalties</h3>

<p>If you use two or more entitlements to licence your vessel, this is known as ‘aggregation’. With a few exceptions, all aggregations are subject to a 5% capacity penalty - so only 95% of the tonnage and engine power on the licence entitlements can be used in the transaction.</p>

<p>If you just use a single licence entitlement, the transaction is exempt from the capacity penalty. This type of transaction is known as a ‘single licence transfer’.</p>

<h3 id="using-components-from-a-disaggregated-entitlement">Using components from a disaggregated entitlement</h3>

<p>Licence entitlements can be split (‘disaggregated’) and the components can be used to licence two or more smaller vessels. When you use component elements of a disaggregated entitlement to license your vessel it must be done as a single licence transfer. You can’t aggregate them with another licence entitlement.</p>

<p>Even though the transaction is a single licence transfer (which are normally exempt from capacity penalties), because you are using components from a disaggregated entitlement the transaction is subject to a 10% capacity penalty. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/changes-to-your-fishing-vessel-licence">changes to your fishing vessel licence.</a></p>

<h3 id="specifying-a-nominee">Specifying a nominee</h3>

<p>You need to specify a nominee to receive all licences and notices of variation. The nominee can be yourself or someone else who can receive them on your behalf.</p>

<h3 id="forms-for-applying-for-a-vessel-licence">Forms for applying for a vessel licence</h3>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/management/licences_apply.htm">find the forms you need to apply for a vessel licence on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="joint-ownership-and-company-applications">Joint ownership and company applications</h2>

<p>There are some additional rules for fishing vessel licence applications made by joint owners and by companies.</p>

<h3 id="joint-ownership">Joint ownership</h3>

<p>If you own a vessel jointly with others, everyone who owns a share in the vessel must sign form AFL2.</p>

<h3 id="company-applications">Company applications</h3>

<p>When a company applies for a licence the application must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a valid certificate of incorporation for the company (or for each company if the vessel is owned by more than one company)</li>
  <li>the names of all the directors</li>
  <li>proof of authority of a signatory to bind the company</li>
</ul>
<p>The application must be signed by the authorised signatory for the company. The authorisation of the signatories must be on headed paper and signed by at least one of the directors or existing signatories.</p>

<p>You must provide the same sort of documentary evidence when a company changes either its name, directors or authorised signatories.</p>

<h3 id="responsibility-for-offences">Responsibility for offences</h3>

<p>All the owners are jointly liable for any offences committed by a vessel in joint ownership.</p>

<h2 id="what-your-licence-looks-like">What your licence looks like</h2>

<p>Your fishing vessel licence will have a number of parts.</p>

<h3 id="part-1">Part 1</h3>

<p>The first part provides details of the:</p>

<ul>
<li>category of licence</li>
  <li>official licence number</li>
  <li>characteristics of your vessel as shown by the Certificate of Registry</li>
  <li>registered owners</li>
</ul>
<p>If they apply, the first part of the licence will also give details of:</p>

<ul>
<li>specific authorities for scallop dredging, beam trawl fishing or shellfish fishing with pots and/or fixed nets</li>
  <li>vessel membership of a fish producers organisation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-2">Part 2</h3>

<p>The second part sets out the conditions that apply to your vessel’s fishing activities, including landing requirements for your catch.</p>

<h3 id="part-3">Part 3</h3>

<p>The third part, the schedule, sets out the authority that allows your vessel to fish.</p>

<h3 id="part-4">Part 4</h3>

<p>The fourth part, the annex to the schedule, sets out the stocks which you are not permitted to fish and any catch limits that apply for stocks that you are allowed to fish and land.</p>

<p>When you get your licence documents you will also receive:</p>

<ul>
<li>supplementary notes</li>
  <li>a notice to owners and masters</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-long-a-licence-is-valid-for">How long a licence is valid for</h2>

<p>The period during which your licence is valid depends on the size of your vessel:</p>

<ul>
<li>licences for vessels over 10 metres in length are valid for two years, running from 1 April until 31 March two years later</li>
  <li>licences for vessels of 10 metres and under in length are valid for two years, running from 1 July until 30 June two years later</li>
</ul>
<p>If your vessel is administered from a port in England, Wales or Northern Ireland your licence will usually be renewed automatically. So you don’t have to do it yourself.</p>

<p>If your vessel is administered at a port in Scotland you’ll have to re-apply for your licence when it comes to an end.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-keep-your-licence">Where to keep your licence</h3>

<p>You must carry your licence, and any variations to it, on board at all times. You must produce them on request to any marine enforcement officer.</p>

<h3 id="licence-changes">Licence changes</h3>

<p>Your licence may be varied by fisheries administrations if there are changes to quota management arrangements. This might happen if a fishery has to be closed when the annual quota limit has been reached.</p>

<p>Your licence might also be varied because of other changes to fisheries management arrangements made during the year - but this would be rare.</p>

<p>Any notice of variation to your licence will be sent to the person you nominated when you applied for the licence. Changes will normally take effect 24 hours after the nominee has been notified of them.</p>
