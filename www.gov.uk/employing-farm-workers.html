<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>As an agricultural employer, there are certain obligations you must meet. These include ensuring your workers’ pay and working conditions meet the minimum requirements, only using labour supplied by authorised providers/gangmasters and meeting your responsibilities under health and safety law.</p>

<p>This guide is aimed at farmers and growers who employ workers as part of their agricultural business. It contains advice on how to take advantage of the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (<abbr title="Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme">SAWS</abbr>) to recruit temporary workers from overseas.</p>

<p>Finally, you will find contact information for organisations that can offer guidance on employing farm workers, and details of where to get advice in the event of an employment dispute.</p>

<h2 id="agricultural-wages-and-working-conditions">Agricultural wages and working conditions</h2>

<p>When you employ someone to work on your farm, you must ensure that you pay them at least the agricultural minimum wage. The minimum wage rate due to each worker varies depending on the grade or category of work involved.</p>

<p>These graded, hourly rates are decided by the Agricultural Wages Board (<abbr title="Agricultural Wages Board">AWB</abbr>) and set out in the annual Agricultural Wages Order.</p>

<p>For further information on the agricultural minimum wage and other terms and working conditions for farm workers, see the guide on agricultural wages.</p>

<p>This guide contains basic information on agricultural employment. For guidance on all aspects of employment law, see our section on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1081597476&amp;r.l2=1082184851&amp;r.l3=1083731932&amp;r.l4=1083730779&amp;topicId=1073858787">employment &amp; skills</a>.</p>

<h2 id="agricultural-labour-providers-and-gangmasters">Agricultural labour providers and gangmasters</h2>

<p>During busy periods - such as lambing season or harvesting - you may need extra workers to help you deal with the additional workload. Most farmers and growers choose to take on temporary staff to deal with these short-term increases in work, rather than permanent employees. One option is to take on additional workers through a labour provider.</p>

<p>If you decide to use a labour provider to supply your farm with temporary workers, you must ensure that the provider is licensed by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (<abbr title="Gangmasters Licensing Authority">GLA</abbr>).</p>

<p>For more details about the specific types of activities regulated by the <abbr title="Gangmasters Licensing Authority">GLA</abbr>, and how to check the register of licensed providers, see the guide on gangmasters licensing.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.gla.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1012752">read a gangmasters licensing overview on the <abbr title="Gangmasters Licensing Authority">GLA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Gangmasters Licensing Authority">GLA</abbr> was set up to prevent workers - particularly illegal immigrants - being exploited by gangmasters. Gangmaster licensing legislation covers the following sectors:</p>

<ul>
<li>agriculture</li>
  <li>forestry</li>
  <li>horticulture</li>
  <li>shellfish gathering</li>
  <li>food processing/packaging</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="labour-licences-for-workers-in-certain-sectors">Labour licences for workers in certain sectors</h3>

<p>If your business uses workers to provide a service in a licensed sector - eg forestry, or if you use workers to gather shellfish, you must be licensed by the <abbr title="Gangmasters Licensing Authority">GLA</abbr>. If you are unsure as to whether or not you need a licence, or whether an exemption applies to your sector, you should contact the <abbr title="Gangmasters Licensing Authority">GLA</abbr> on Tel 0845 602 5020 or email them at <a href="mailto:enquiries@gla.gsi.gov.uk">enquiries@gla.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>It is illegal for a labour provider to operate without a licence. It is also a criminal offence for you - as a labour user - to knowingly make an agreement to obtain workers from an unlicensed provider. You can <a rel="external" href="http://laws.gla.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&amp;Module=PublicRegister">check whether a potential labour provider has a licence through the public register on the <abbr title="Gangmasters Licensing Authority">GLA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>An alternative to using a labour provider is to take on short-term overseas staff through <abbr title="Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme">SAWS</abbr>, if you meet the <abbr title="Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme">SAWS</abbr> requirements and via an approved <abbr title="Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme">SAWS</abbr> operator. </p>

<h2 id="seasonal-agricultural-workers">Seasonal agricultural workers</h2>

<p><abbr title="Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme">SAWS</abbr> allows UK farmers and growers that meet prescribed conditions to recruit low-skilled, overseas workers for short-term agricultural work. This can be particularly helpful during seasonal peaks in your workload.</p>

<p>Suitable work includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>planting and gathering crops</li>
  <li>on-farm processing/packing of crops</li>
  <li>handling livestock</li>
</ul>
<p>The scheme is managed by Home Office-approved operators who have a fixed quota of work cards they can issue to eligible applicants each year. These work cards allow short-term immigration, giving permission to work for a maximum of six months.</p>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme">SAWS</abbr>, you must provide any <abbr title="Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme">SAWS</abbr> workers with accommodation, and pay them in line with the agricultural minimum wage. For more information, see the section on agricultural wages and working conditions.</p>

<h2 id="agricultural-health-and-safety-and-environmental-management">Agricultural health and safety and environmental management</h2>

<p>Health and safety is a key concern for agricultural businesses. The nature of agricultural work - and farms in general - means there are many hazards with the potential to cause serious accidents. These could result in significant injury or death, as well other consequences such as significant financial or environmental costs.</p>

<p>As an employer, you are legally obliged to take measures to protect the health and safety of your workers. This duty of care also extends to any members of the public affected by your agricultural practices such as contractors and suppliers.</p>

<p>You should carry out a risk assessment to identify any aspects of your business that could pose a risk to the health and safety of those affected by your business.</p>

<p>You can read more in the guide on farm health and safety: the basics.</p>

<p>For basic information on environmental management, see the section on measuring and reporting environmental performance.</p>

<h2 id="skills-learning-and-training-for-farm-workers">Skills, learning and training for farm workers</h2>

<p>Research published in November 2008 found that only 47 per cent of environmental and land-based businesses had provided funded training in the previous 12 months and only 17 per cent had training budgets. (Source: UK Commission for Employment and Skills, Skills for the Workplace: Employer Perspectives).</p>

<p>Providing training to your workers can help increase their productivity. This in turn can help make your business more competitive and efficient. Training can be invaluable if you are introducing new working methods or technologies, or if you are taking on new workers. It can also help ensure that workers are carrying out their jobs safely - a key consideration in this sector.</p>

<p>For further information on training and skills in the agricultural sector, see the guide on agricultural skills and training.</p>

<p>Lantra is the Skills Sector Council for environmental and land-based industries in the UK. Lantra can help your business identify training needs, develop and utilise existing skills and access funding for training.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.lantra.co.uk/coursefinder.aspx">Search for training courses specific to your business on the Lantra website</a>.</p>

<p>Lantra can also help you access funding for your training programme. <a rel="external" href="http://www.lantra.co.uk/Business/Fund-Finder/Flexible-Funding-Opportunities.aspx">Read about sources of training funding on the Lantra website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="agricultural-employment-disputes">Agricultural employment disputes</h2>

<p>As an employer, you can avoid most potential conflicts and disputes by:</p>

<ul>
<li>providing a good working environment</li>
  <li>providing safe working conditions</li>
  <li>implementing fair policies and practices</li>
  <li>offering a reasonable remuneration package to your workers</li>
  <li>maintaining good communication with your workers to minimise the chances of misunderstandings and disagreements</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also good practice to establish procedures - preferably in writing - for dealing with disagreements and disputes so that they can be handled quickly and effectively at an early stage.</p>

<p>If a dispute does arise, you should follow your procedures in the first instance to try and resolve the issue. Involving employee representatives or union officials can help you reach a swift conclusion to the dispute.</p>

<p>Depending on the reason for the dispute, you may need to seek outside help to resolve the matter. If you need advice on meeting the requirements of the Agricultural Wages Order (<abbr title="Agricultural Wages Order">AWO</abbr>), you can contact the Pay and Work Rights Helpline on Tel 0800 917 2368.</p>

<p>If you have a query which is not related to the <abbr title="Agricultural Wages Order">AWO</abbr>, you can obtain general employment advice from Acas. Acas is an independent statutory body whose role is to improve working life through better employment relations.</p>

<p>Acas can not only help to resolve a dispute once it arises, but can also help employers and workers (or their representatives) work together to prevent disputes arising in the first place. Acas offers workplace training and workshops aimed at helping organisations adopt or develop better employment relations practices.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1461">Find employment advice on the Acas website</a> or call the Acas Helpline on 08457 47 47 47.</p>
