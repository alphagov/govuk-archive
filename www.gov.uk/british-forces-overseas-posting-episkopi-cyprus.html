<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The present headquarters of British Forces Cyprus was formed in 1988 from an amalgamation of headquarters Land Forces Cyprus and air headquarters Middle East. It is a joint headquarters which answers direct to the Chief of Joint Operations at the permanent joint headquarters. The appointment of CBF alternates between the Army and the Royal Air Force.  </p>

<p>Command in Cyprus is exercised through 2 garrison headquarters, one at Dhekelia and the other at Episkopi, and through an RAF station headquarters at RAF Akrotiri. Although a number of airmen are based at RAF Akrotiri, and soldiers are at Episkopi and Dhekelia, at all locations there is a mix of Army, RN and RAF personnel. </p>

<p>British Forces in Cyprus have often been at the leading edge of forming joint or tri-service units including joint service health, port, adventure training, logistics, security, police and engineering units, a tri-service hospital and the Joint Services Signals Unit (Cyprus).</p>

<p>The main functions of the command are to provide and protect vital strategic communications facilities; to provide and protect an important airhead at RAF Akrotiri; to provide a base from which to react in the event of a military crisis in theatre; and to provide Army and RAF training areas.</p>

<h2 id="medical-facilities">Medical facilities</h2>

<p>The Medical Centre is situated at British Forces Episkopi, approximately half way between the majority of married quarters and working locations.

<p>In addition to providing a full range of all the primary health care facilities you would expect from a civilian medical practice in the UK, an emergency ambulance service and minor casualty reception facility is operated 24 hours a day.</p>
