<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Before you introduce fish into rivers or stillwater fisheries you must get written consent from the Environment Agency. If you are introducing fish to open waters, where water can flow from one body of water to another, a health check is required.</p>

<p>Health checks test a fish sample for serious diseases or parasites that are not native to this country. They also check whether fish are ‘clinically infected’ with native parasites and are fit for introduction. There’s a minimum number of fish that need to be checked to give an acceptable chance of diseases and parasites being detected.</p>

<p>Only approved independent fish health consultants can carry out health checks. You may need to deliver the fish to them, or they may be able to carry out the test at your fishery.</p>

<p>This guide explains why health checks are needed and the diseases and parasites they test for. It gives details of accredited consultants that are able to carry out the checks.</p>

<h2 id="why-health-checks-are-needed">Why health checks are needed</h2>

<p>Introducing harmful diseases and parasites is one of the biggest risks when you stock your fishery. Some diseases can cause a significant number of deaths among your fish, while others can lead to long-term problems for your fishery.</p>

<p>When stocking a river or stillwater fishery with any fish you must get written ‘Section 30’ consent from the Environment Agency - see the page on fish movements into inland waters in the guide on moving fish and shellfish.</p>

<p>If you are introducing fish to ‘open waters’ (also known as ‘mandatory’ waters), the Environment Agency will only grant Section 30 consent if a sample of your fish has passed a health check. Open waters include:</p>

<ul>
<li>rivers, canals, drains or other open waters</li>
  <li>stillwaters connected to open waters</li>
  <li>stillwaters situated in the 1 in a 100 year floodplain</li>
</ul>
<p>If fish carrying diseases or parasites are introduced to open waters those parasites and diseases could spread and infect fish populations in the wider environment. This is why health checks are needed.</p>

<h3 id="health-checks-for-moving-fish-into-enclosed-waters">Health checks for moving fish into enclosed waters</h3>

<p>When you introduce fish into enclosed waters where the risk of them escaping is minimal, health checks are not required except where there are special ecological concerns. Even so, we recommend that all fish movements are supported by a health check. It is good fisheries management practice.</p>

<p>To help you get the best results when you introduce fish, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Business/stocking__eng_172017.pdf">download guidance to stocking fish from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 693KB)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fish-parasites-and-diseases-the-health-checks-test-for">Fish parasites and diseases the health checks test for</h2>

<p>Fish health checks test for parasites and signs of disease in your fish. They look for evidence of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Category 1 ‘notifiable’ diseases - if one of these very serious diseases is suspected through the presence of clinical symptoms, the case is passed to the Fish Health Inspectorate for further investigation and to stop it spreading</li>
  <li>Category 2 parasites</li>
  <li>novel parasites</li>
  <li>clinical infection of native parasites or other clinical conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these are found, the fish will fail the health check.</p>

<h3 id="category-2-parasites">Category 2 parasites</h3>

<p>Category 2 parasites are not native to this country but they have become established here. They have been shown to harm fish or fish populations, because native fish stocks have no natural immunity to these parasites.</p>

<p>The parasites currently on the Category 2 list are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anguillicoloides crassus, which affects eels</li>
  <li>Bothriochephalus acheilognathi, which affects common carp and carp variants</li>
  <li>Ergasilus briani, which affects many salmonid and coarse fish species</li>
  <li>Ergasilus sieboldi, which affects many salmonid and coarse fish species</li>
  <li>Ergasilus gibbus, which affects eels</li>
  <li>Monobothrium wageneri, which affects tench</li>
  <li>Pomphorhynchus laevis, which affects salmonids and riverine coarse fish species</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="novel-parasites-and-diseases">Novel parasites and diseases</h3>

<p>Novel parasites and diseases are those which have been found in this country but have a very limited distribution. They have either a significant disease potential or an unknown disease potential. The known novel parasites that are tested for are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lernea cyprinacea, which affects cyprinids</li>
  <li>Pellucidhaptor pricei, which affects common bream</li>
  <li>Philometroides sanguineus, which affects crucian carp and goldfish</li>
  <li>Tracheliastes polycolpus and Tracheliastes maculatus, which affects a range of coarse fish species including salmonids</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="clinical-infection-with-a-native-parasite">Clinical infection with a native parasite</h3>

<p>Generally, native parasites don’t cause problems to fish stocks. But if fish are found to have a ‘clinical infection’ from a native parasite then they will fail a health check. Clinical infection is either when a parasite is in such high numbers that it is detrimental to the host fish, or if the fish are showing symptoms such as bacterial or fungal infections. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/commercial/32870.aspx">read about native parasites on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="number-of-fish-that-need-to-be-checked">Number of fish that need to be checked</h2>

<p>The fish that you submit for a health check must be representative of the fish being stocked into your fishery. There are rules about the number, size and species of fish that need to be examined. These rules are based on evidence that:</p>

<ul>
<li>a certain number of fish need to be examined to give an acceptable chance of detecting infections of diseases and Category 2 or novel parasites</li>
  <li>some parasites are specific to the species of fish they infect</li>
  <li>some parasites show a preference to the size of the fish they infect</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules have been designed to be as simple as possible and take into account the value of the fish, in terms of both number and cost.</p>

<h3 id="sample-sizes">Sample sizes</h3>

<p>For a mandatory health check, you must have examined:</p>

<ul>
<li>a minimum of 30 fish in total</li>
  <li>a minimum of ten fish of each species you are planning to introduce</li>
  <li>a minimum of five fish from each size category you are planning to introduce</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="size-categories">Size categories</h3>

<p>Native fish species are divided into four groups, each of which have their own size categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>pike are in a group on their own and have a small and large size category</li>
  <li>carp, tench, barbel and common bream are in ‘Group 1’ and are divided into small, medium and large size categories</li>
  <li>all other species such as roach, rudd, trout, salmon and gudgeon are in ‘Group 2’ and are divided into small and large size categories</li>
  <li>for all species (excluding pike) fry of less than 5 centimetres have a size category of their own</li>
</ul>
<p>For a more comprehensive guide and examples of how the size category rules are applied, <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Guide-Fish-Size.pdf">download Environment Agency guidance on fish size rules for Section 30 health checks (PDF, 87KB)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="get-a-health-check">Get a health check</h2>

<p>Fish health checks can only be carried out by accredited independent fish health consultants. The accreditation scheme is operated by the Institute of Fisheries Management (<abbr title="Institute of Fisheries Management">IFM</abbr>).</p>

<p>All consultants accredited by the <abbr title="Institute of Fisheries Management">IFM</abbr> are suitably qualified and experienced, and are required to carry out regular continuing professional development.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Institute of Fisheries Management">IFM</abbr> keeps an up-to-date record of all consultants who are accredited to carry out Section 30 health checks.</p>

<h3 id="submit-your-fish-for-a-health-check">Submit your fish for a health check</h3>

<p>You can deliver your fish to a consultant yourself or you can use a courier. In some cases a consultant may be able to carry out the health check at your fishery. For details on how to bag and transport fish for health checks, <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Guide-Health-Checks.pdf">download Environment Agency guidance on bagging and transporting live fish (PDF, 121KB)</a>.</p>

<p>Remember that if you’re transporting fish yourself, you must take certain steps to protect their welfare - see the page on your responsibilities when transporting fish in the guide on moving fish and shellfish.</p>
