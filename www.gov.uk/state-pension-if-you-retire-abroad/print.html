</article><article id="rates-of-state-pension"><header><h1>Part 2: Rates of State Pension</h1>
  </header><p>Find out what the current <a href="/state-pension" title="State Pension">State Pension rate</a> is.</p>

<p>Your State Pension will increase each year, but only if you live in: </p>

<ul>
<li>the UK for 6 months or more each year</li>
  <li>the European Economic Area (EEA)</li>
  <li>Switzerland</li>
  <li>a country that has a <a rel="external" href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/international/social-security-agreements/" title="Countries that have a social security agreement with the UK">social security agreement with the UK</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>If you live outside these areas, you won’t get yearly increases. But if you return to live in the UK, your State Pension will be increased each year.</p>

</article><article id="payment"><header><h1>Part 3: Payment</h1>
  </header><p>Your State Pension can be paid into:</p>

<ul>
<li>a bank in the country you’re living in </li>
  <li>a bank or building society in the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use:</p>

<ul>
<li>an account in your name</li>
  <li>a joint account</li>
  <li>someone else’s account - if you have their permission and keep to the terms and conditions of the account</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll be paid in local currency - the amount of money you get may change slightly due to exchange rates.</p>
</div>

<h2>Payment to a bank or building society in the UK</h2>

<p>Your State Pension will be paid by either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a deposit into any UK bank or building society account </li>
  <li>a type of cheque (payable order) in sterling to your home address</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to be paid every 4 or 13 weeks.</p>

<p>If your State Pension is under £5 per week, you’ll be paid once a year in December.</p>

<h2>You spend part of the year abroad</h2>
<p>If you divide your time between the UK and another country, you must choose which country you want your UK State Pension paid into. </p>

<p>You <strong>can’t</strong> choose to have it paid in one country for part of the year, and a different country for the rest of the year.</p>

</article><article id="tax-on-your-state-pension"><header><h1>Part 4: Tax on your State Pension</h1>
  </header><p>You may have to pay UK tax on your State Pension if you live abroad. This will depend on:</p>

<ul>
<li>your taxable income</li>
  <li>whether you’re classed as a ‘UK resident’ or ‘non-UK resident’ for tax purposes</li>
</ul>
<h2>UK residency</h2>
<p>The rules of UK residency are complex. Generally, you’re classed as a UK resident if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>spend 183 days or more in the UK in a tax year</li>
  <li>come to the UK for 91 days or more each tax year averaged out for up to 4 years</li>
</ul>
<h3>UK residents</h3>
<p>The rules are the same as for people living in the UK – you’ll only pay tax if your <a href="/tax-national-insurance-after-state-pension-age" title="Find out what your taxable income is">taxable income</a> is over a certain amount.</p>

<h3>Non-UK residents</h3>
<p>Non-UK residents don’t pay UK tax on their state pension but may pay tax in the country they live in.  But if you live in <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/si/double.htm" title="Countries with a 'double taxation agreement with the UK’">a country without a ‘double taxation agreement’</a> you’ll have to pay UK tax and may be taxed in the country you live in as well.</p>
