  </header><p>Eligible employees can take unpaid parental leave to look after their child’s welfare, eg to: </p>

<ul>
<li>spend more time with their children </li>
  <li>look at new schools </li>
  <li>settle children into new childcare arrangements </li>
  <li>spend more time with family - eg visiting grandparents </li>
</ul>
<p>Their <a href="/employee-rights-when-on-leave" title="employment rights when on leave">employment rights</a>  (like the right to pay, holidays and returning to a job) are protected during parental leave.</p>

</article><article id="entitlement"><header><h1>Part 2: Entitlement</h1>
  </header><p>Parental leave is unpaid. The child must be under 5 (or 18 in special circumstances).</p>

<p>The limit on how much parental leave can be taken a year is 4 weeks (unless the employer agrees otherwise).  </p>

<p>Unless an employer agrees otherwise, or the child is disabled, leave should be taken in blocks of one week. </p>

<p>A ‘week’ equals the length of time an employee normally works in a week. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
If an employee works 3 days a week, one ‘week’ of parental leave equals 3 days. If an employee works irregular weeks the number of days in a ‘week’ is the total number of days they work a year divided by 52.</p>
</div>

<h2>Carrying leave over from a previous job</h2>

<p>Parental leave applies to each child not to an individual’s job. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
An employee is entitled to 13 weeks. They’ve used 8 with a previous employer. They can use up to 5 weeks with their new employer if they’re <a href="/parental-leave/eligibility" title="eligibility">eligible</a>. From 8 March 2013 employees are entitled to 18 weeks, so in this example an employee can use up to 10 weeks with their new employer if eligible.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>Employees qualify if all of these apply: </p>

<ul>
<li>they’ve been in the company for more than a year </li>
  <li>they’re named on the child’s birth or adoption certificate </li>
  <li>they have or expect to have <a href="/parental-rights-responsibilities/what-is-parental-responsibility" title="what is parental responsibility?">parental responsibility</a> </li>
  <li>they’re not self-employed or a ‘worker’ - eg an agency worker or contractor </li>
  <li>they’re not a foster parent (unless they’ve secured parental responsibility through the courts)</li>
  <li>the child is under 5 (or 18 in <a href="/parental-leave/entitlement" title="Age limit of child">special circumstances</a>) - this will change to under 18 from 8 March 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>Employers can ask for proof (like a birth certificate) as long as it’s reasonable to do so - eg they can’t ask for proof each time an employee requests leave. </p>

<p>Employers can extend parental leave to those groups who aren’t eligible. Employees can check this in their staff handbook. </p>

</article><article id="notice-period"><header><h1>Part 4: Notice period</h1>
  </header><p>Employees must give 21 days’ notice before their intended start date. If they or their wife or partner are having a baby or adopting, it’s 21 days before the week the baby or child is expected. </p>

<p>Employees must confirm the start and end dates in their notice. Unless an employer requests it, this doesn’t have to be in writing. </p>

</article><article id="delaying-leave"><header><h1>Part 5: Delaying leave</h1>
  </header><p>Leave can’t be postponed (delayed) if: </p>

<ul>
<li>the employer doesn’t have a ‘significant reason’ - eg it would cause serious disruption to the business </li>
  <li>it’s being taken by the father or partner immediately after the birth or adoption of a child </li>
  <li>it means an employee would no longer qualify for parental leave - eg postponing it until after the child’s 5th birthday (18th birthday from 8 March 2013)</li>
</ul>
<p>If it’s postponed, the employer: </p>

<ul>
<li>must write explaining why within 7 days of the original request </li>
  <li>suggest a new start date - this must be within 6 months of the requested start date </li>
  <li>can’t change the amount of leave being requested </li>
