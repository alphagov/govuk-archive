<p>You will be sent a copy of the decision in the post.</p>

<h2>If you’ve asked for a hearing</h2>

<p>If you asked for your case to be decided at a hearing, you’ll get a letter with details of where to go.</p>

<p>The hearing will be attended by:</p>

<li>a judge or judges, sometimes with other tribunal members</li>
  <li>your representative, if you have one</li>
  <li>a Home Office ‘presenting officer’</li>
  <li>any witnesses called to give evidence</li>
  <li>an interpreter, if you’ve asked for one</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have to give evidence at the hearing and answer questions.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The hearing will be held without you if you live outside the UK, but you can ask someone to represent you.</p>
</div>

<h2>The tribunal’s decision</h2>

<p>The tribunal will either decide to:</p>

<ul>
<li>allow your appeal - and let you enter or stay in the country</li>
  <li>dismiss your appeal - and uphold the Home Office’s original decision</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You will usually get a copy of the tribunal’s decision within 10 working days of the hearing.</p>

<h2>If you win your appeal</h2>

<p>The judge may order the Home Office to pay you an award. This will be up to the amount you paid for the tribunal fee.</p>
