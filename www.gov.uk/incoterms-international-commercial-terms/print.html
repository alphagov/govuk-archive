  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>International Commercial Terms (‘Incoterms’) are internationally recognised standard trade terms used in sales contracts. They’re used to make sure buyer and seller know:</p>

<ul>
<li>who is responsible for the cost of transporting the goods, including insurance, taxes and duties</li>
  <li>where the goods should be picked up from and transported to</li>
  <li>who is responsible for the goods at each step during transportation</li>
</ul>
<p>The current set of Incoterms is Incoterms 2010. A copy of the full terms is <a rel="external" href="http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/incoterms-2010/" title="Incoterms 2010">available from the International Chamber of Commerce.</a></p>

</article><article id="what-the-terms-mean"><header><h1>Part 2: What the terms mean</h1>
  </header><p>Incoterms are used in contracts in a 3-letter format followed by the place specified in the contract (eg the port or where the goods are to be picked up).</p>

<p>There are different terms for sea and inland waterways (eg rivers and canals) compared to all other modes of transport.</p>
