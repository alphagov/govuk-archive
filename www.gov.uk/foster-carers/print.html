<h2>Fostering agencies</h2>

<p>Some local councils use fostering agencies to get children into foster care, particularly children who might be hard to place. You can contact a fostering agency directly. </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll attend a group preparation session with other people who are applying.</p>
</li>

<h2>Tax-free earnings</h2>

<h3>Tax exemption</h3>

<p>There’s a fixed tax exemption of up to £10,000 per year (less if for a shorter period) which is shared equally among any foster carers in the same household. This means you don’t have to pay tax on the first £10,000 income you make from fostering.</p>

<h3>Tax relief</h3>

<p>On top of the £10,000 exemption, you also get <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/individuals/foster-carers.htm" title="Foster care relief">tax relief</a> for every week (or part week) that a child is in your care. This means you don’t have to pay tax on some of your earnings over £10,000.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

<p>Laura is a foster carer for a 14-year-old for the whole of the year and for an 8-year-old for 10 weeks of the year. She doesn’t have to pay tax on the first £25,000 she earns:</p>

<p>Tax exemption = £10,000<br>
+<br>
Child 1 (52 x £250) = £13,000<br>
+<br>
Child 2 (10 x £200) = £2, 000  </p>

<p>Total = £25,000</p>

<h2>Pensions</h2>

<p>If you foster, you’ll be eligible for <a href="/boost-state-pension" title="National Insurance credits">National Insurance credits</a>, which counts towards your <a href="/state-pension" title="State pension">State Pension</a>.</p>

</article><article id="training-and-support-for-foster-carers"><header><h1>Part 3: Training and support for foster carers</h1>
  </header><p>Foster carers are reviewed every year by the local council or fostering agency. They can provide training if needed. </p>

<p>A supervising social worker will visit you regularly to offer advice and support.</p>

<h2>Help and support with fostering</h2>

<p>Call Fosterline (run by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fostering.net/" title="Fostering Network">Fostering Network</a>) for advice on anything to do with fostering.</p>

<h2>What foster carers should know</h2>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.cwdcouncil.org.uk/foster-care/standards" title="Training, Support and Development Standards">Training, Support and Development Standards</a> set out what you should know and be able to do within the first 12 to 18 months of your time as a foster carer.</p>

</article><article id="types-of-foster-care"><header><h1>Part 4: Types of foster care</h1>
  </header><h2>Emergency</h2>

<p>If children need somewhere safe to stay for a few nights.</p>

<h2>Short-term</h2>

<p>Carers look after children for a few weeks or months while plans are made for the child’s future.</p>

<h2>Short breaks</h2>

<p>When children who are disabled, have special needs or have behavioural difficulties regularly stay for a while with a family. This means their parents or usual foster carers can have a break.</p>

<h2>Remand</h2>

<p>When young people are remanded by a court to be looked after by a specially-trained foster carer.</p>

<h2>Long-term</h2>

<p>Not all children who need to permanently live away from their birth family want to be adopted, so instead they go into long-term foster care until they’re adults.</p>

<h2>‘Family and friends’ or ‘kinship’</h2>

<p>A child being cared for by the local council goes to live with someone they already know, usually a family member.</p>

<h2>Specialist therapeutic</h2>

<p>For children and young people with very complex needs and/or challenging behaviour.</p>
