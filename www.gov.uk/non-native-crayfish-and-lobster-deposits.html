<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Regulations and controls exist to protect native wildlife species from threats caused by the introduction of non-native species. Non-native animals can carry and spread diseases to which native species often have no defence. They can also out-compete native animals, putting pressure on their populations and often resulting in population decline.</p>

<p>There are legal controls in the UK to protect native crayfish and lobster populations from the damage that can be caused when non-native varieties are introduced into their habitats. These aim to prevent both deliberate and accidental introductions of non-native species by placing conditions on their introduction to the UK and their location once they are in the country.</p>

<p>These conditions are imposed through licensing systems. Those wishing to introduce or keep non-native species must obtain appropriate licences before doing so.</p>

<p>This guide explains the regulations and licensing requirements that apply to non-native crayfish and lobsters. It tells you which activities are controlled or prohibited under the legislation, and the type of licence you need to cover your activities.</p>

<h2 id="controls-on-non-native-crayfish">Controls on non-native crayfish</h2>

<p>Non-native crayfish are a major threat to the white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) - Britain’s only native crayfish species. In particular, the non-native signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) out-competes the white-clawed variety, as well as carrying a fungal disease to which the native species has no defence.</p>

<h3 id="wildlife-and-countryside-act">Wildlife and Countryside Act</h3>

<p>According to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it is an offence for anyone without a licence to release a non-native animal into the wild in Great Britain, or to allow one to escape. For example, it would be an offence under the act to introduce non-native crayfish into a water body like an ornamental pond or farm tank from which they could escape into the wild. This is enforced by Natural England.</p>

<h3 id="specific-controls-on-crayfish">Specific controls on crayfish</h3>

<p>The Prohibition of Keeping of Live Fish (Crayfish) Order 1996 makes it an offence in England and Wales for anyone without a licence to keep any live non-native. This is enforced by the Fish Health Inspectorate at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture Science.</p>

<p>The legislation makes an exception to the licensing requirement for signal crayfish in particular parts of England and Wales where there are already extensive populations of these.</p>

<p>Separate legislation applies in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2 id="licences-for-keeping-crayfish">Licences for keeping crayfish</h2>

<p>Under legislation designed to protect native crayfish you need a licence to keep any non-native species. Because of the damage that non-native species can cause to the native crayfish population if they escape into the wild, licences are generally only granted for the purposes of aquaculture and research. However, the licensing system makes provision for the supply of non-native species directly for human consumption, and for the keeping of redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) as an ornamental animal in heated indoor aquaria.</p>

<p>The only exception to the licensing requirement applies to signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) kept in particular areas of England and Wales where there are already extensive populations.</p>

<h3 id="aquaculture-and-scientific-research">Aquaculture and scientific research</h3>

<p>If you intend to keep non-native crayfish for aquaculture or research then you will need a licence. Crayfish farms always need a licence regardless of their location.</p>

<p>A licence will only be granted if the crayfish are to be kept at a secure indoor facility, for example, an enclosed outdoor pond may be acceptable if it is secure.</p>

<p>Licence applications in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are handled by the devolved regional administrations.</p>

<p>Once you have submitted an application your facilities will be inspected and relevant government agencies consulted before a licence can be issued.</p>

<h3 id="non-native-crayfish-kept-for-direct-supply-for-human-consumption">Non-native crayfish kept for direct supply for human consumption</h3>

<p>A general licence exists for outlets like fishmongers and restaurants to allow them to keep non-native crayfish for direct human consumption. They can keep non-native species temporarily before transferring them for human consumption, while hotels and restaurants can keep them to serve to their customers.</p>

<p>As long as the crayfish are held securely, and any unused crayfish are dead before disposal, the general licence will cover these activities and you won’t need to make an individual licence application.</p>

<h3 id="ponds-and-ornamental-aquaria">Ponds and ornamental aquaria</h3>

<p>Licences are not granted for keeping non-native crayfish as ornamental animals in ponds and aquaria. This practice is prohibited.</p>

<p>An exception is made for one species of tropical non-native crayfish, the redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus). If you keep these in a heated indoor aquarium then you can do so under general licensing terms and you don’t need to make an individual licence application.</p>

<h2 id="licence-for-releasing-importing-and-trapping-crayfish">Licence for releasing, importing and trapping crayfish</h2>

<p>A licence to keep non-native crayfish does not permit you to release them into the wild. It is against the law to release non-native crayfish or their eggs into the wild without a licence granted under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. These licences as issued by Natural England.</p>

<p>However, because crayfish are highly mobile and non-native species cause considerable damage to native populations, you will not normally be granted a licence to release them into the wild.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-ILFA1.pdf">download a licence application form for introducing non-native fish into the wild from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website (PDF, 80KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="importing-tropical-redclaw-crayfish">Importing tropical redclaw crayfish</h3>

<p>You can import the redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) but you cannot introduce them into the wild.</p>

<p>To import any aquatic animal, however, you will need to be an authorised importer. For more information see the page on authorisation and documentation for live fish, molluscs and crustacea importers in the guide on importing live fish, molluscs and crustacea.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-trap-non-native-species">How to trap non-native species</h3>

<p>If you want to trap and remove non-native crayfish from waters in England or Wales you can apply for written permission from the Environment Agency. It is also your responsibility to get the necessary consent from the land owner. If the local conditions are suitable then the Environment Agency may grant permission.</p>

<p>Be aware that you cannot re-introduce non-native crayfish that you catch to any waters without a licence to do so.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/recreation/fishing/38051.aspx">find out about getting permission to trap non-native crayfish on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<h2 id="offences-and-penalties-under-crayfish-control-legislation">Offences and penalties under crayfish control legislation</h2>

<p>Under legislation that exists to protect native white-clawed crayfish it is a criminal offence for anyone to:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep live non-native signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in any area not excluded from the requirement to obtain a licence</li>
  <li>keep any other live species of non-native crayfish without being covered by an appropriate licence</li>
  <li>fail to meet any conditions (specific or general) placed on a licence - for example, it would be an offence to supply listed species to someone who is not covered by an appropriate licence</li>
  <li>trap crayfish without a licence</li>
  <li>use any crayfish or part of, live or dead, for bait</li>
</ul>
<p>The only non-native tropical species of crayfish that can be kept legally as an ornamental fish is the redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus). No other tropical non-native crayfish variety can be kept for this purpose under either general or individual licensing arrangements.</p>

<p>If you fail to comply with licence conditions then the licence could be revoked and you may face prosecution.</p>

<p>If you are prosecuted for any of the above offences you could receive a penalty of up to £2,500. Any illegally-held crayfish will be seized and destroyed.</p>

<p>Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it is a criminal offence to:</p>

<ul>
<li>release any non-native animal, including non-native crayfish, into the wild</li>
  <li>allow any non-native animal to escape into the wild, for example by releasing non-native crayfish into a pond from which they could escape</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone found guilty of these offences faces a fine.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-or-depositing-lobsters">Introducing or depositing lobsters</h2>

<p>Special legislation exists to protect UK lobster stocks by preventing the introduction and spread of non-native lobsters and their diseases. The legislation applies to the following types of lobster:</p>

<ul>
<li>European lobster (Homarus gammarus)</li>
  <li>American or Canadian lobster (Homarus americanus)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you plan to introduce or deposit lobsters in the UK - whether they are alive or dead - then you must comply with the legislation and obtain a licence where necessary. There are two types of licence in England and Wales, a general licence and an individual licence. Separate but similar licensing arrangements exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3 id="general-licence">General licence</h3>

<p>A general licence is in place to cover certain situations where lobsters are introduced or deposited. Under its arrangements you don’t need to make an individual application for a licence if you intend to deposit or introduce:</p>

<ul>
<li>European lobsters that have not been kept in tanks or systems that contain - or have contained - American or Canadian lobsters</li>
  <li>European or Canadian lobsters to be held on the site where they will be consumed, provided that none of the water in which they are held, nor any lobster waste, is discharged into tidal waters</li>
  <li>European or American lobsters that are canned, frozen, or prepared in some other way</li>
  <li>American lobsters deposited at a site that is more than one mile away from tidal waters</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="individual-licences">Individual licences</h3>

<p>If you intend to introduce or deposit lobsters in England and Wales in any situation not covered by the above then you will need an individual licence from the Fish Health Inspectorate.</p>
