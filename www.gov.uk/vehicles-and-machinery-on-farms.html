<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Farming can be a hazardous occupation with its regular use of various types of vehicles, machinery and equipment. Many health and safety issues on a farm arise from vehicles and machinery, so it’s important that you know how to prevent potential problems.</p>

<p>The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 established the principle that those who create risk are best placed to manage it. The Act led to the formation of the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>). The <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> works to help prevent injury, ill health and death to those at work, including employers, employees, self employed, contractors, suppliers and manufacturers.</p>

<p>This legislation states that if you employ workers on your farm you must ensure their safety. You must maintain safe work areas, practices and work systems, provide appropriate training and supervision, and not place the health and safety of any third party at risk. Your employees must also take reasonable care to avoid injury and not put the health and safety of any third party at risk.</p>

<p>This guide outlines the main health and safety information for the most common vehicles, machinery and equipment on the farm. It explains how the legislation applies to you, how to avoid any health and safety risks and outlines the hazards of using machinery.</p>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-purchasing-ce-marked-vehicles">The importance of purchasing CE marked vehicles</h2>

<p>All farming vehicles, machinery and equipment must be safe to use, pose no hazard to your health and be appropriate for their specific jobs.</p>

<p>The Health and Safety at Work legislation requires that any new machine, vehicle or farming or forestry equipment you buy must be ‘CE’ marked. This mark means that each has been built to minimum legal safety requirements. They should also have a certificate of conformity, a workshop manual and any information on noise levels. If the noise levels are above acceptable legal levels, you should provide additional protection for those who will be using the machines.</p>

<h3 id="buying-second-hand-machines-vehicles-or-equipment">Buying second-hand machines, vehicles or equipment</h3>

<p>If you are planning to buy second-hand machines, you should check that:</p>

<ul>
<li>tractors and machinery comply with the requirements within the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (<abbr title="Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998">PUWER</abbr>) - if they don’t, you must bring them up to the required standard before you use them</li>
  <li>the operator’s manual is provided or that suitable information can be obtained</li>
  <li>any missing or damaged safety guards can be replaced or repaired before using the machine</li>
</ul>
<p>When you buy or hire machines, the law requires the supplier to provide necessary safeguards.</p>

<h2 id="maintaining-farm-vehicles-and-machinery">Maintaining farm vehicles and machinery</h2>

<p>Whether you are self employed or employ people on your farm, you must make sure that all your equipment is properly repaired and in working order. You need to perform regular maintenance checks on all machinery - including brakes, hydraulic hoses and power take-off guards.</p>

<p>You can find useful equipment maintenance checklists on the British Agricultural and Garden Machinery Association (<abbr title="British Agricultural and Garden Machinery Association">BAGMA</abbr>) website.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/repository/vehiclehealthcheck.pdf">Download vehicle health and trailed appliances checks checklists from the Department for Transport website (PDF, 795KB)</a>.</p>

<p>You should also be sure that anyone using farm equipment can operate it safely. They need to provide training and instruction for every piece of equipment they use.</p>

<p>Read more in the guide on agricultural skills, learning and training.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-accidents-and-health-risks">Avoiding accidents and health risks</h2>

<p>There are a number of health risks when working with farming vehicles and machinery. Among these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>slips and falls - eg caused by wearing improper footwear or working on slippery surfaces</li>
  <li>fractured bones - eg caused by falls or overturned vehicles</li>
  <li>amputations - eg caused by wearing improper or inappropriate clothing near machinery or failing to use safety equipment</li>
  <li>head injuries - eg caused by overturned vehicles or faulty vehicle brakes</li>
  <li>crushing injuries - eg caused by faulty brakes, vehicles that are not in proper gear, or overturning vehicles</li>
  <li>contact with overhead electrical power lines - eg caused by working too close to power lines</li>
  <li>fatal injuries</li>
</ul>

<p>You can avoid accidents and health risks by strictly following good practices. These are not compulsory, but you may find them helpful in considering them in all of your farming activities:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure that all machinery is properly maintained and repaired</li>
  <li>wear suitable clothing and footwear, namely safety boots</li>
  <li>read and understand the instruction manual of any machinery you are going to use</li>
  <li>tie back long hair</li>
  <li>remove any jewellery that can be caught in machinery</li>
  <li>wear a seat belt - this is a legal requirement</li>
  <li>make sure the machine’s handbrake is applied</li>
  <li>use ‘safe stop’ when necessary - ie handbrake is on, controls are on neutral, engine is stopped, key is removed</li>
  <li>keep machinery clean and mud-free</li>
  <li>remove loose tools and other pieces of equipment from inside cabs</li>
  <li>check for any bystanders and children when manoeuvring or operating machinery</li>
  <li>do not work near low-hanging power lines</li>
  <li>be familiar with the ground you’re working on</li>
</ul>
<p>The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 requires that you:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure - as far as reasonably possible - the health, safety and welfare of your employees and any others who may be affected by what your employees do</li>
  <li>carry out a risk assessment if you are an employer</li>
  <li>establish a carefully prepared action plan on health and safety that’s specific to your farm</li>
  <li>organise your workers through communication, co-operation, competence and control</li>
  <li>plan and set standards to be sure that your health and safety practices work</li>
  <li>check how you’re doing through regular inspections and monitoring, and by acting on any problems should they occur</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dangerous-parts-of-tractors-and-other-equipment">Dangerous parts of tractors and other equipment</h2>

<p>Farming vehicles, equipment and machinery can be hazardous if proper use and maintenance practices aren’t followed.</p>

<p>For example, if you are operating a tractor, you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure that the power take-off (<abbr title="power take-off">PTO</abbr>) shaft guards are made to a recognised standard - such as BS EN ISO 5674 - and of the correct size and length when closed and when extended</li>
  <li>be sure that the guards are of a non-rotating type, and have a restraining device - such as securing chains that are properly in place and secured</li>
  <li>be certain that guards are cleaned and lubricated at regular intervals and ensure that they are capable of providing proper protection</li>
  <li>ensure that the <abbr title="power take-off">PTO</abbr> is supported when not connected - it should not be rested on the drawbar or suspended by the restraining device</li>
  <li>not use adaptors to allow a spline 1,000 rotations per minute (rpm) shaft to drive a six-spline 540rpm shaft</li>
</ul>

<p>When dealing with other dangerous machine parts, you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>be sure that safeguards are strong enough and securely attached to the machine</li>
  <li>make sure that they are self-locking or need a tool to open them</li>
  <li>ensure that they are made of the correct materials - eg no plastic because it can be easily damaged</li>
  <li>check and maintain them on a regular basis</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="health-and-safety-at-work-legislation">Health and Safety at Work legislation</h2>

<p>Health and safety concerns on your farm require you to adhere to several regulations.</p>

<p>The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 establishes the general duties that you have towards your employees and members of the public. It also covers those duties that your employees have towards themselves and each other. The law requires that you practice good management and common sense, identify risks and take reasonable measures. The Act applies to every work activity undertaken on your farm.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg163.pdf">Download the five steps to risk assessment from the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website (PDF, 106K)</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998">PUWER</abbr> requires that risks to people’s health and safety from equipment used at work be controlled or prevented.</p>

<p>The equipment covered includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>hammers</li>
  <li>ladders</li>
  <li>knives</li>
  <li>circular saws</li>
  <li>drilling machines</li>
  <li>power presses</li>
  <li>motor vehicles</li>
  <li>dumper trucks</li>
  <li>lifting equipment</li>
  <li>employees’ own equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also an additional requirement from the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 (<abbr title="Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998">LOLER</abbr>) for any lifting equipment that’s used.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg291.pdf">Download a guide to the <abbr title="Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998">PUWER</abbr> 1998 from the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website (PDF, 158KB)</a>.</p>

<p>The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (the Management Regulations) make even more clear what you are required to do to manage health and safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act. This regulation also applies to every work activity on your farm. Its main requirement is that you must conduct a risk assessment and if you have five or more employees, you must record any significant findings.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg163.pdf">Download the five steps to risk assessment from the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website (PDF, 106KB)</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/carrying-out-health-and-safety-risk-assessments">read the guide on managing the risks in your business</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008">SMSR</abbr> places responsibility on those who supply any machinery and safety components. These include manufacturers, importers and others in the supply chain. Requirements for the equipment must be met before any items can be supplied in the UK. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>conformity assessments</li>
  <li>declaration of conformity</li>
  <li>CE marking</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998">LOLER</abbr> requires that any lifting equipment used at work for lifting and lowering loads is:</p>

<ul>
<li>strong and stable enough for the particular use</li>
  <li>marked to indicate safe working loads</li>
  <li>used safely by competent people who have planned and organised the work properly</li>
  <li>positioned and installed properly to minimise risks</li>
</ul>
<p>The responsibility for enforcing <abbr title="Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998">PUWER</abbr>, <abbr title="Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998">LOLER</abbr> and <abbr title="Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008">SMSR</abbr> is divided between the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> and local authorities. In the event of a breach in a health and safety regulation - even if a risk assessment has been carried out - you may receive a large fine and possibly even serve a prison sentence if the breach is severe enough. In most instances, it is the local authority that would prosecute the breach.</p>

<h3 id="edwards-top-tips">Edward’s top tips:</h3>

<ul>
<li>“Basically it means that every time we go into a field we are going down the same wheeling.”</li>
  <li>“We’ve reduced the amount of the time we are in the field now, and there’s more land for direct drilling.”</li>
  <li>“Diesel usage has gone from 120 litres a hectare down to around 60 litres a hectare.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Edward Dale is an arable and combinable crop farmer from Lincolnshire. Here he outlines the benefits of controlled traffic farming: water soaks through the ground better, increased yeilds, less fuel usage, less time establishing a crop and more fertile soil. </p>
