<p>The breakdown of the application for approval for DDR includes:</p>

<h2 id="initial-approval">1. Initial approval</h2>

<p>1.1 An applicant seeking approval to deliver a Drink Drive Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS) course must provide the required evidence to demonstrate how they meet the specified criteria.</p>

<p>1.2 The initial approval decision will be made by a desk-based analysis of ‘self certified’ evidence provided by the applicant.</p>

<p>1.3 The provider of the approved course will thereafter be required to periodically provide the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) with data to enable ongoing, risk-based, quality management.</p>

<h3 id="course-content">Course content</h3>
<p>Applicants must be able to provide evidence that:</p>

<p>1.3.1 The course content and learning materials clearly link to the desired outcome of the current DSA DDRS Syllabus (published by the Secretary of State for Transport) and ultimately the DSA National Driving Standard (Category B)</p>

<p>1.3.2 The course content links to the theoretical and professional models and adult learning principles which underpin the Syllabus 
.
1.3.3 The course they intend to deliver is capable of providing an appropriate, client-centred, response to the learning needs of offenders:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>taking into consideration different learning styles and varying levels of ability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regardless of their gender, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief and with particular reference to those groups within the category B driving population defined as ‘vulnerable’ (young persons (17-18 years ), the elderly  and those with a recognised learning or physical disability)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="course-delivery-arrangements">Course delivery arrangements</h3>
<p>Applicants must be able to provide evidence that:</p>

<p>1.3.4 The course, including the delivery and administration arrangements, aligns with the DDRS course guidance published by DSA on behalf of the Secretary of State for Transport.</p>

<p>1.3.5 They employ, or have access to, sufficient suitably qualified trainers to deliver the proposed course consistently to an appropriate standard.</p>

<p>NB It is not a formal requirement that every member of staff should be able to evidence the full range of competences required to deliver DDRS. For example, individuals may be employed to deliver specific elements of the syllabus e.g. information about crash statistics. In these circumstances applicants must explain how they intend to deploy individual staff to ensure the full requirements of the syllabus will be delivered</p>

<p>1.3.6   They have in place resources, including access to premises which comply with relevant health and safety regulations, are conducive to learning and provide appropriate levels of confidentiality for all those taking part, sufficient to meet demand in all the specified areas covered by their application.</p>

<p>1.3.7  They have in place plans for the deployment of staff sufficient to ensure the security of all staff involved in delivery and to meet demand in all specified geographical areas covered by their application</p>

<p>1.3.8   A recognised method of course and trainer evaluation (such as the Kirkpatrick four level training evaluation model ) will be operated in order to confirm, as a minimum, that Reaction (level 1) and Transfer of Learning (level 2) have taken place, demonstrating that each offender has gained a basic level of understanding.</p>

<p>1.3.9. Processes are in place to ensure all staff:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>understand their duty of care, and the limits of their competence, in relation to individuals who request further assistance or who present evidence of harmful or dependent drinking and who may benefit from medical support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>know how to provide guidance to individuals who request further assistance </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="course-administration-arrangements">Course administration arrangements</h3>

<p>1.3.10 Applicants must provide evidence processes in place to capture and respond to customer complaints</p>

<p>1.3.11 Applicants must provide evidence that they have suitable processes and procedures in place to:</p>

<ul>
<li>record the number of referred offenders from court</li>
  <li>record the number of referred offenders transferred from and to another DDRS course provider</li>
  <li>identify the percentage of referred offenders who begin the course</li>
  <li>identify the number of referred offenders who successfully complete the course</li>
  <li>identify the reasons referred offenders give for leaving the course before completion </li>
  <li>record complaints received and disposal of complaints</li>
  <li>record and report a summary of course and trainer evaluation findings and related actions</li>
  <li>ensure that all such records are kept accurately and in compliance with the relevant legislation</li>
  <li>assurance that data collected via these processes will be retained in accordance with the requirements of Data Protection legislation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="appropriate-persons">Appropriate persons</h3>
<p>Applicants must provide:</p>

<p>1.3.12 Details of the legal status of the organisation making the application</p>

<p>1.3.13 Details of the key management personnel in the organisation making the application, sufficient to allow the DSA to satisfy itself that there are no other matters which might disqualify them from being appropriate persons to be responsible for an approved DDR course</p>

<p>1.3.14 Details of at least one senior manager who is resident in the UK and who will be the main point of contact, on a day to day basis, for the management of the programme.</p>

<p>1.4 DSA will not, normally, require a centre inspection to take place prior to, or as part of, the initial approval process.</p>

<p>1.5 The case officer responsible for the desk-based analysis of evidence will present their recommendation regarding approval to the appropriate person responsible for approval at the DSA.</p>

<p>1.6 DSA may, on behalf of the Secretary of State, decide to refuse approval of a course, or to grant approval subject to conditions.</p>

<p>1.7 Where the appropriate person responsible for approval at DSA feels unable to reach a judgement based on the recommendation, for example, due to uncertainty as to whether the evidence provided meets the approval criteria requirement, they may call on the services of an appropriate expert. However, in the majority of cases any such issues would normally be resolved in the initial review of evidence.</p>

<p>1.8 DSA must give a decision in writing on each application for approval, on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p>

<h2 id="initial-centre-inspection-and-follow-up">2. Initial centre inspection and follow-up</h2>

<p>2.1 DSA will, normally, undertake an initial centre inspection, within 12 months of a provider being approved to deliver DDRS courses. The cost of this inspection will be covered by the application (for approval) fee.</p>

<p>2.2 DSA will prioritise its programme of centre inspections based on the information available to it. For example, where DSA has not seen evidence demonstrating previous competence in delivery of DDRS or related courses, the provider is likely to be inspected before an organisation which has demonstrated previous competence in delivery of a DDRS or related course.</p>

<p>2.3 Where a provider has previously demonstrated competence in the delivery of DDRS courses, the inspection may be omitted; so long DSA is confident that no aspect of the provision has changed substantially.</p>

<p>2.4 During a centre inspection, the case officer will confirm the information given in the provider’s application and seek to give developmental feedback. </p>

<p>2.5 DSA will agree a date for the centre inspection with the provider, and give them an outline of what they wish to see during that inspection.</p>

<p>2.6  A case officer undertaking a centre inspection will produce a report of their findings within 10 working days. That report will be sent to the provider for their information.</p>

<p>2.7 The report of a centre inspection will include an indication of whether the provision is:</p>

<ul>
<li>compliant</li>
  <li>not compliant (subject to areas for development)</li>
</ul>
<p>2.8 The content of centre inspection reports will be confidential to the provider concerned and DSA.</p>

<p>2.9 Where a case officer reports that provision is ‘Not compliant’ they will inform the provider of the developmental requirements which must be made to resolve any issues, and a date by which those changes must be made. </p>

<p>2.10 Compliance with any development requirement should be evidenced in written or electronic form within the specified timescale.</p>

<h2 id="quality-assurance">3 Quality assurance</h2>

<p>Further quality assurance processes, including scheduled and unannounced quality assurance audit inspections, and reporting:</p>

<p>3.1 DSA may undertake further quality assurance processes, including requiring the provider to produce additional information or making additional audit inspections, either to the administration centre or to course delivery locations, during the provider’s period of approval.</p>

<p>3.2 Further requirements to provide information or to conduct additional centre inspections will be evidence lead, informed by the initial centre inspections, follow-up and other relevant factors, for example complaints received by DSA, inconsistencies in numerical or financial reporting, changes to the organisational structure, changes to training delivery or a change of ownership in total or in part. It is the responsibility of the provider of the approved course to produce the required information to allay any concerns that might arise. </p>

<p>3.3 The schedule for quality assurance visits (including scheduled and unannounced quality assurance audit inspections, either to the administration centre and/or to course delivery locations) will be determined by DSA on risk-based criteria. However, each provider should expect to receive at least one quality assurance inspection during their period of approval.</p>

<p>3.4 DSA will normally agree an appropriate date for a centre or course delivery inspection, with the provider and give them an outline of what they wish to see during that inspection. </p>

<p>3.5 The duration of any centre or course delivery inspection will be the minimum time required to allow the case officer to have confidence in their conclusions, and for the provider to make available any information that they believe is relevant. </p>

<p>3.6 Where DSA has reason to believe that some aspect of a course is being delivered or managed inappropriately, it reserves the right to make unannounced inspections (either to the administration centre and/or to course delivery locations).  </p>

<p>3.7 Centre or course delivery inspections may cover any aspect of provision, but DSA will be evidence led. DSA will not, normally, require the provider to produce additional documentation beyond the agreed reporting requirements, unless there is clear reason to do so.</p>

<p>3.8 The report of a quality assurance inspection will include indication of whether the provision is:</p>

<ul>
<li>outstanding</li>
  <li>good</li>
  <li>satisfactory</li>
  <li>inadequate</li>
</ul>
<p>3.9 Where a case officer reports that provision is ‘Inadequate’ they will inform the provider of the changes which must be made to resolve any issues, and a date by which those changes must be made. </p>

<p>3.10 Failure to make required changes by the agreed date following an ‘Inadequate’ classification may result in DSA issuing a 28 day notification of being minded to suspend or withdraw approval to deliver DDRS courses, dependent on the severity of findings underpinning the classification, and any non-compliance.</p>

<p>3.11 Compliance with any requirement to change should be evidenced in written or electronic form.</p>

<p>3.12 Where a case officer reports that provision is ‘Satisfactory’ they will inform the provider of developments and actions recommended for improving the provision and outcomes of the course. </p>

<p>3.13 Whether as part of a centre or course inspection or through other information or investigation DSA is satisfied that there is serious misconduct on the part of the course provider, or a person acting on behalf, or under the direction of the course provider, approval will be withdrawn without delay. Under these circumstances, DSA on behalf of the Secretary of State, will indicate the reason for the withdrawal of approval and, if appropriate, the nature of any serious misconduct.</p>
