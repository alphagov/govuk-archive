  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t need a licence to drive a mobility scooter or powered wheelchair, but you may have to register it and get a ‘nil value’ tax disc. Only certain types can be <a href="/mobility-scooters-and-powered-wheelchairs-rules/driving-on-the-road" title="Driving on the road">driven on the road</a>.</p>

<p>Mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs come in 2 categories:</p>

<ul>

  <li>‘class 3 invalid carriages’ - these can be used on the road, and have a maximum speed of 4mph off the road, and 8mph on the road </li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to register a class 2 invalid carriage and they don’t need a tax disc.</p>

<p>Class 3 invalid carriages need to display a ‘nil value’ tax disc and be registered with <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>. You must be 14 or over to drive a class 3 invalid carriage.</p>


</article><article id="rules-for-class-3-invalid-carriages"><header><h1>Part 2: Rules for class 3 invalid carriages</h1>
