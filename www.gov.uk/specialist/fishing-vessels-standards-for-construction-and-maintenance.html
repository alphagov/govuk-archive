<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The construction, maintenance and operation of fishing vessels is controlled by national and international regulations and legislation. These form the basis of the classification, certification and inspection of fishing vessels.</p>

<p>This guide outlines the standards and regulations applying to fishing vessels. It also covers sources of additional information for owners, operators and crew.</p>

<h2 id="fishing-vessels-codes-of-practice">Fishing Vessels: Codes of Practice</h2>

<p>The standards for the construction and maintenance of fishing vessels vary according to the vessel’s overall length.</p>

<p>There are separate standards for fishing vessels, covering fishing vessels of the following length:</p>

<ul>
<li>up to 15 metres overall length</li>
  <li>from 15 overall length to 24 metres registered length</li>
  <li>over 24 metres registered length</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vessels-under-24-metres-registered-length">Vessels under 24 metres registered length</h3>

<p>Vessels of less than 24 metres are covered by codes of practice, set out in the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (<abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>) documents, Merchant Shipping Notice (<abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr>) 1813 (F) and <abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr> 1770 (F).</p>

<h3 id="vessels-over-24-metres-registered-length">Vessels over 24 metres registered length</h3>

<p>The code of practice for fishing vessels over 24 metres in length were published in 2011.  The codes and regulations cover fishing vessel design and construction - as well as maintenance, safety and emergency procedures. They form the basis for surveys of new vessels, and of the periodic surveys of all fishing vessels over 15 metres length.</p>

<h3 id="vessels-under-15-metres-overall-length">Vessels under 15 metres overall length</h3>

<p>Fishing vessels under 15 metres are not subject to statutory surveys, but the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> will inspect them periodically to ensure they are seaworthy, equipped to a safe standard, and that they comply with the relevant code.</p>

<h2 id="construction-standards-for-fishing-vessels">Construction standards for fishing vessels</h2>

<p>If your fishing vessels are registered in the UK, or operating in UK waters, they are required by law to be seaworthy and equipped to a safe standard. Specific construction standards cover the physical structure of the vessel - including deckhouses and superstructures - and machinery and equipment.</p>

<p>The Sea Fish Industry Authority (<abbr title="Sea Fish Industry Authority">Seafish</abbr>) has established construction standards for fishing vessels of up to 15 metres overall length, and of 15 to less than 24 metres. All new vessels must meet these standards.</p>

<h3 id="vessels-up-to-15-metres-overall-length">Vessels up to 15 metres overall length</h3>

<p>If you want to register a vessel of up to 15 metres on the UK register, you must demonstrate its seaworthiness and safety. If your vessels were built after 16 July 2007, they must conform to the <abbr title="Sea Fish Industry Authority">Seafish</abbr> Construction Standards.</p>

<p>If your vessels were built before 16 July 2007, you must prove they are seaworthy by submitting them to <abbr title="Sea Fish Industry Authority">Seafish</abbr> for a registration survey, for assessment against their standards.</p>

<p>After registration, you will need to arrange a <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> inspection of safety equipment and crew qualifications. This inspection must be repeated every five years, along with annual self certification. For more information, see the guide <a href="https://www.gov.uk/fishing-vessel-classification-registration-and-inspection">fishing vessel classification, registration and inspection</a>.</p>

<p>Details of <abbr title="Sea Fish Industry Authority">Seafish</abbr> survey fees can be obtained by contacting <abbr title="Sea Fish Industry Authority">Seafish</abbr> Marine Services on 01472 252 300 or by emailing <a href="mailto:information@seafishmarineservices.com">information@seafishmarineservices.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id="vessels-15-to-24-metres-overall-length">Vessels 15 to 24 metres overall length</h3>

<p>Medium-sized fishing vessels must meet the construction requirements in the code of practice for fishing vessels of 15 to 24 metres.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/1770_a.pdf">Download Merchant Shipping Notice (<abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr>) 1770 (F) The Code of Safe Working Practice for the Construction and Use of 15-24 Metre Fishing Vessels from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 1.23MB).</a></p>

<p>New vessels in this size range must also conform to the <abbr title="Sea Fish Industry Authority">Seafish</abbr> Construction Standards.</p>

<p>These vessels must be surveyed by <abbr title="Sea Fish Industry Authority">Seafish</abbr> against their Construction Standards, then undergo an <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> survey under the code of practice <abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr> 1770. The vessel should be resurveyed after five years to renew its Fishing Vessel Certificate, and also undergo a mid-term inspection. Owners must also complete an annual self-certification. For more information, see the guide to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/fishing-vessel-classification-registration-and-inspection">fishing vessel classification, registration and inspection</a>.</p>

<h3 id="vessels-over-24-metres">Vessels over 24 metres</h3>

<p>The construction of larger fishing vessels is governed by the Fishing Vessels (EC Directive on Harmonised Safety Regime) Regulations 1999, as amended in 2003. The regulations require vessels of this size to comply with the Torremolinos Protocol and the amendments to the protocol contained in the 1999 and 2003 Regulations.</p>

<p>The protocol sets standards in areas such as construction, stability, machinery, emergency procedures and vessel certification. Existing vessels should also comply with the Fishing Vessels (Safety Provisions) Rules 1975, as amended. Your surveyor can provide guidance on which sections of the rules apply to you.</p>

<p>Fishing vessels over 24 metres must be surveyed annually by UK-authorised Classification Societies, to ensure compliance with the regulations. The Classification Society will carry out a full survey every five years, to ensure the vessel remains in class.</p>

<p>The six Classification Societies are:</p>

<ul>
<li>American Bureau of Shipping</li>
  <li>Bureau Veritas</li>
  <li>Det Norske Veritas</li>
  <li>Germanischer Lloyd</li>
  <li>Lloyds Register of Shipping</li>
  <li>Registro Italiano Navale</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> will survey the vessel for its International Fishing Vessel Certificate when the owner wishes to place it on the UK Register, and at intervals of four years afterwards. The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> will also carry out an intermediate survey, 21 to 27 months after the certificate was issued. For more information, see the guide to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/fishing-vessel-classification-registration-and-inspection">fishing vessel classification, registration and inspection</a>.</p>

<h2 id="maintenance-standards-for-fishing-vessels">Maintenance standards for fishing vessels</h2>

<p>Fishing vessel codes of practice emphasise the importance of regular maintenance of a high standard - particularly of safety equipment and systems. For vessels below 24 metres in length, this requirement forms part of the annual self-certification needed to maintain the Fishing Certificate.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> inspects vessels of 15 to 24 metres overall length. Vessels over 24 metres have safety equipment and systems checked annually, and are also subject to more detailed statutory intermediate surveys. If safety equipment is not properly maintained, vessels may be detained and the owners prosecuted.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> also provides guidance on specific problems, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>premature failure of copper pipes in engine cooling water systems</li>
  <li>avoiding engine failure due to fuel contamination</li>
  <li>avoiding flooding by using suitable grades of stainless steel for pipe work</li>
  <li>bilge systems and additional/alternative equipment to help prevent flooding</li>
  <li>testing of emergency sources of electrical power</li>
  <li>maintenance of electrical equipment</li>
  <li>maintenance of portable fire extinguishers</li>
  <li>fire detection and alarm systems on fishing vessels</li>
</ul>
<p>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (<abbr title="Royal National Lifeboat Institution">RNLI</abbr>) publishes a range of leaflets, reports and DVDs on fishing safety. <a rel="external" href="https://rnli.org/safetyandeducation/stayingsafe/Pages/Fishing-safety.aspx">Find fishing safety advice on the <abbr title="Royal National Lifeboat Institution">RNLI</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="flooding">Flooding</h3>

<p>The condition of seawater pipework within a fishing vessel is an important factor in preventing flooding in a vessel.</p>

<p>Stainless steel seawater pipework can reduce pipework corrosion, but some grades of stainless steel are not suitable for marine use. For example, austenitic stainless steels (304/304L and 316/316L) may be at risk of chloride stress corrosion cracking when used with seawater or polluted water, possibly leading to fracture. One solution is to increase the nickel content (eg alloy 330, 904L) or to use a duplex or ferritic stainless steel, eg 329, 2205, 439, 26Cr 1 Mo.</p>

<h2 id="operational-standards-for-fishing-vessels">Operational standards for fishing vessels</h2>

<p>Fishing vessel codes of practice and regulations provide guidance on best practice in areas such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>fire protection, including fire precautions and the deployment and use of fire-protection equipment</li>
  <li>protection of personnel, including risk assessments, accident prevention and securing of equipment</li>
  <li>life-saving equipment</li>
  <li>emergency procedures, including inspections and drills in relation to emergency procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>You must ensure that all onboard equipment is of serviceable condition and regularly maintained. Equipment and maintenance schedules are inspected during statutory surveys of vessels over 15 metres in length.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> will check these areas in smaller fishing vessels during normal inspections.</p>
