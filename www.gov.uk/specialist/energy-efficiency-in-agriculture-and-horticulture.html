<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Energy costs in farming may only account for a small proportion of turnover but reducing them directly increases profits. Cutting energy costs by 20% can make the same difference to profits as increasing sales by 5%. As energy costs are rising, it makes sense to closely monitor your expenditure and reduce it where possible. However, if you are paying utility companies by direct debit, this can be difficult to change. You should ensure that you always understand what tariff you are on and what your energy costs are.</p>

<p>The agricultural sector covers many different types of business, including pig and poultry farms, dairy farms and arable farms. But there are energy-saving measures common to all farm types that will increase energy performance and lower costs.</p>

<p>This guide explains the actions that farmers and growers can take to reduce energy consumption, many of which are low or no-cost. It also includes details of the interest-free loans available to help fund new energy-efficient equipment, and information about the Enhanced Capital Allowances scheme, with links to further guidance on the Carbon Trust website.</p>

<h2 id="energy-use-in-agriculture-and-horticulture">Energy use in agriculture and horticulture</h2>

<p>Agricultural and horticultural businesses carry out a wide range of different activities but there are many common areas where energy is wasted. There are several low and no-cost measures, as well as those requiring investment, that farming businesses can put in place to lower energy consumption and save money.</p>

<h3 id="major-areas-of-energy-consumption">Major areas of energy consumption</h3>

<p>Across all farming businesses, the major areas of energy consumption are lighting, heating, ventilation, air circulation and refrigeration. The main areas of energy consumption by broad agricultural activity are:</p>

<ul>
<li>horticulture - heating typically accounts for 90% of the energy used in a greenhouse</li>
  <li>pig farming - energy is used in a number of pig farming processes, including welfare and feeding systems, building services and environmental protection, waste management and emissions control</li>
  <li>poultry farming - most energy is used for maintaining good environmental conditions for housing the flock</li>
  <li>dairy - cooling milk and heating water account for as much as 65% of the energy used, with lighting and pumping also significant consumers</li>
  <li>crop stores - the amount of energy required by a crop store is closely linked to the thickness of the insulation and the difference between the storage temperature and the temperature outside</li>
  <li>combinable crops - energy is often wasted in storing and drying these crops</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benefits-of-controlling-energy-use">Benefits of controlling energy use</h3>

<p>The benefits of introducing energy-saving measures on your farm include:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduced costs and improved profitability</li>
  <li>better internal environment in production units</li>
  <li>improved crop quality</li>
  <li>compliance with assurance schemes</li>
  <li>improved working conditions for you and your staff</li>
  <li>being able to demonstrate your ‘green’ credentials</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sector-guidance">Sector guidance</h3>

<p>The Carbon Trust has produced a guide on the agriculture and horticulture sector that includes practical energy-saving ideas for farming businesses. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/advice/sector-specific-publications">find an overview of energy saving measures for the agricultural and horticultural sector on the Carbon Trust website.</a>.</p>

<h2 id="energy-management-in-agriculture">Energy management in agriculture</h2>

<p>Like all resources, energy use needs to be properly managed. It’s important to make sure that your staff members are aware of the benefits that energy efficiency can bring and this can help to get your entire workforce involved and committed.</p>

<p>As a first step, it’s a good idea to draw up and implement an energy management policy. Involve staff members in drawing up the policy and encourage them to take an active part in implementing it. </p>

<h3 id="quick-wins-for-saving-energy">Quick wins for saving energy</h3>

<p>Walk around your farm and see if there are simple things you can do to reduce energy consumption. Make a note of how you use energy and the condition of the energy infrastructure such as lights, motors and switches. It’s also important to be aware of what everything does and this is where labelling switches can be helpful. Think about whether the lighting you use is the right type and in the right place and also whether you are maximising daylight.</p>

<p>There are several opportunities for saving energy that you can add to your energy strategy for little or no cost, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensuring you know how much energy you use, and how much it costs</li>
  <li>being aware of where energy is used in your business</li>
  <li>properly maintaining your building fabric and appliances</li>
  <li>switching off appliances and processes when they are not needed - either manually or by using timers</li>
  <li>including energy-efficiency measures as part of your routine maintenance</li>
  <li>making simple adjustments to the location and settings of controls</li>
  <li>ensuring you are on the most appropriate energy tariff for your business requirements</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monitoring-energy-use">Monitoring energy use</h3>

<p>If you have them, take a look at your bills from the last year to see if your energy use changed throughout that period. Try to identify if changes are due to levels of production and weather variations at different times of the year. It’s a good idea to put in place systems so you can monitor energy use on an ongoing basis.</p>

<h3 id="benchmarking-your-energy-use">Benchmarking your energy use</h3>

<p>Benchmarking your results helps you to see the energy-saving progress you make. It also enables you to compare your energy performance with similar farming businesses so you can identify areas where savings can be made.</p>

<p>The Carbon Trust has produced a guide on energy-saving in the agriculture and horticulture sector that includes benchmarking data for pig and horticulture farms. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/advice/sector-specific-publications">find an overview of energy saving measures for the agricultural and horticultural sector on the Carbon Trust website.</a></p>

<h3 id="financial-assistance">Financial assistance</h3>

<p>You may be eligible for financial assistance in the form of a zero per cent interest loan from the Carbon Trust. These are currently available to farmers in Northern Ireland and Wales to upgrade to more energy-efficient equipment. <a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.com/client-services/northern-ireland/loans-eligibility">Find guidance on interest-free loans for farmers on the Carbon Trust website</a>.</p>

<p>As a further incentive, the Enhanced Capital Allowances (<abbr title="Enhanced Capital Allowances">ECA</abbr>) scheme encourages businesses to invest in energy-saving items. If they meet certain performance criteria they qualify for a 100% first year tax allowance. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.com/client-services/technology/implementation/enhanced-capital-allowances">find out about the <abbr title="Enhanced Capital Allowances">ECA</abbr> scheme on the Carbon Trust website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="improving-the-energy-performance-of-heating-systems">Improving the energy performance of heating systems</h2>

<p>Heating is one of the biggest energy costs for farming businesses. But there are some simple measures you can take to improve energy performance and reduce costs. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping doors and windows closed when the heating is running</li>
  <li>improving building fabric and maintenance of roofs, doors, window frames and glazing</li>
  <li>making sure temperature controls match the activities being carried out and that control systems are set correctly</li>
  <li>maintaining boilers and pipework - a regularly serviced boiler can save as much as 10% on your annual heating costs</li>
  <li>considering ‘radiant’ heating, which is generally mounted overhead, as an alternative to space heating</li>
  <li>insulating boilers, hot water tanks and pipework</li>
  <li>replacing old and inefficient heating system controls</li>
  <li>installing solar thermal systems for hot water heating - this can effectively reduce costs and have a short pay back period</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improving-performance---sector-tips">Improving performance - sector tips</h3>

<p>About a third of the energy consumed on a pig breeding unit is used for heating the creeps in farrowing pens. By installing thermostatic creep controls and under-floor heating pads instead of infrared bulbs, you can make significant energy savings. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.com/our-clients?sector=&amp;service=1284">find more case studies for reducing energy costs on the Carbon Trust website.</a></p>

<p>Dairy farms consume a great deal of energy heating milking parlours, which tend to be uninsulated and draughty. Radiant heating is a much more effective way to heat a parlour than space heating. Insulating pipes properly can mean that you don’t have to heat the milking parlour all the time.</p>

<p>Horticulture farms can improve the energy performance of greenhouses by:</p>

<ul>
<li>using thermal screens</li>
  <li>regularly cleaning measuring boxes and sensors</li>
  <li>cleaning the glass regularly</li>
  <li>using climate control equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/Publications/pages/publicationdetail.aspx?id=CTS187">find a case study showing how thermal screens can significantly reduce energy costs on the Carbon Trust website</a>.</p>

<p>When you store crops make sure that the store is at the right temperature by checking the sensors each year. For drying combinable crops, put in place a maintenance plan to ensure that heaters and dehumidifiers are working correctly. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/Various/Cut%20carbon%20and%20reduce%20costs/CTS185_12058_Farming_CS_Grain_lo.pdf">download a case study showing how grain drying upgrades can reduce energy costs from the Carbon Trust website (PDF, 151K)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-the-energy-used-by-ventilation-systems">Reducing the energy used by ventilation systems</h2>

<p>Ventilation and air circulation typically account for between 25 and 30% of farm energy bills, but by adopting energy-saving measures you can cut costs by around 20%. Although some of these require investment, the pay-back in energy savings makes them worthwhile.</p>

<p>The steps that you can take to cut costs include:</p>

<ul>
<li>using natural ventilation so you can switch off or turn down fans and mechanical ventilation units</li>
  <li>carrying out regular maintenance of your ventilation equipment</li>
  <li>fitting variable-speed drives to ventilation and air circulation fans to match the output speed to requirements at different times of the day </li>
  <li>using system controls to optimise ventilation rates</li>
  <li>installing interlocked control systems that switch off a ventilation unit when the specific piece of equipment requiring ventilation is also switched off</li>
  <li>improving airflow by installing well-designed ducts and air inlets and outlets</li>
  <li>using energy-efficient fans and ducts</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improving-performance---sector-tips-1">Improving performance - sector tips</h3>

<p>For pig and poultry farms it’s important to acquire the best ventilation equipment available because the level of ventilation directly affects feed and mortality rates. You also need to make sure that the winter ventilation rate is accurately controlled and that ventilation systems are well maintained.</p>

<p>It’s also very important that ventilation systems for pig farms are designed to suit different stages of growth. Where possible, install automatically-controlled natural ventilation in pig kennels.</p>

<p>Horticulture farms can reduce energy consumption by directing air to where it’s most needed by using ceiling-mounted circulation fans. Your greenhouses may also benefit from automatic doors at the main entry points to minimise heat loss.</p>

<p>For combinable crops and crop storage you can reduce energy costs by inspecting the ducts and carrying out repairs as necessary. Managing the stores to create good airflow and promote consistent drying and ensuring all fans are in good working order can also reduce costs.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-energy-used-by-lighting">Reducing energy used by lighting</h2>

<p>Lighting can account for 20% of the energy used on a farm and because electricity is comparatively expensive this could represent over half of your total energy costs. The more effective your lighting system is, the more money you will save.</p>

<p>There are some very simple ways that you can improve the energy performance of your lighting systems, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>having a ‘switch off’ policy to make sure that you and your staff always turn off lights when they are not needed, for example outside lights in daylight or lights left on in storage areas when no deliveries are taking place</li>
  <li>clearly labelling light switches so that staff can easily select only the lights they need for a particular task</li>
  <li>regularly maintaining lighting systems by replacing old dim lamps, checking controls are working correctly and keeping important components clean</li>
  <li>installing the appropriate lighting unit for the task</li>
  <li>replacing traditional bulbs with low-energy lighting</li>
  <li>installing occupancy and daylight sensors</li>
  <li>refurbishing older, fluorescent lighting systems with modern high-frequency fittings</li>
</ul>

<p>Two different levels of lighting are normally required on pig farms, depending on whether workers are in the room or not. By using dimmable ballasts you can create a dual-use lighting system that’s appropriate for workers and for stock.</p>

<p>Pig and poultry farms can save up to 70% of their lighting costs by replacing tungsten lights with alternatives like fluorescent or sodium lamps. Tungsten bulbs used to heat creeps in pig farrowing pens are particularly inefficient and could be replaced with under-floor heating pads.</p>

<p>For combinable crops and crop storage it is best practice to fit shatterproof covers to all lamps to comply with the crop-protection requirements of assurance schemes.</p>

<p>Horticulture farms need to carry out regular cleaning and maintenance of supplementary lighting systems. Older reflectors need to be re-anodized or replaced after about five years.</p>

<p>The Carbon Trust has produced a guide on the agriculture and horticulture sector that includes practical energy-saving ideas for farming businesses, including sector tips. It also provides a comparison table of energy-efficient lighting options.

<h2 id="reducing-energy-consumed-during-refrigeration">Reducing energy consumed during refrigeration</h2>

<p>In some farming sectors, particularly dairy farming, refrigeration accounts for a significant amount of the total energy consumed. In many cases you can save around 10% of your energy costs by putting in place low or no-cost measures. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>running equipment at the correct temperature and avoiding overcooling - if you set temperatures lower than they need to be you will be wasting energy</li>
  <li>making sure that equipment is operated at peak efficiency - refrigerators need to be located away from heat sources and kept full but not overloaded and chiller doors need to be kept shut</li>
  <li>maintaining refrigeration equipment to ensure optimum performance - check door seals on cold rooms and refrigerators, keep condensers clean and free of dust, and make sure that systems have the correct amount of refrigerant</li>
  <li>insulate pipework and replace insulation in places where it’s damaged or missing</li>
  <li>prevent cool air escaping from store-rooms by fitting PVC curtains or self-closing doors</li>
  <li>replacing existing equipment with more efficient alternatives - you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/cut-carbon-reduce-costs/products-services/technology-advice/Pages/refrigeration-introduction.aspx">find out about energy-efficient refrigeration systems on the Carbon Trust website</a>

</ul>

<p>Cooling milk and heating water account for over 60% of the energy used on a typical dairy farm. You could halve your costs by pre-cooling milk using a ‘water to milk’ plate cooler. You could make further savings by re-using the water elsewhere and also by recovering the heat used in the milk cooling system. <a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/Publications/pages/publicationdetail.aspx?id=CTS188">Find a case study showing how heat recovery can result in significant energy savings on the Carbon Trust website</a>.</p>

<p>For crop storage it’s a good idea to take advantage of natural ventilation. By using this in combination with refrigerated cooling systems you can achieve optimum energy efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="minimising-building-fabric-energy-losses">Minimising building fabric energy losses</h2>

<p>Farm buildings range from new, purpose-built structures to barns and other outhouses that may be hundreds of years old. In each case, the nature of the building fabric will have a direct impact on the amount of energy needed for heating, ventilation and cooling. The building fabric includes the ceiling, floor, walls, doors and windows.</p>

<p>Any improvements you are able to make to the building fabric will bring benefits such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>better temperature control, enabling you to reduce ventilation costs and prevent overheating</li>
  <li>increased productivity - staff morale and output can be improved by providing a comfortable working environment</li>
  <li>lower expenditure - more efficient buildings that are well insulated need less heating and ventilation</li>
  <li>an increase in the value of the building</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="measures-you-can-take-to-improve-the-building-fabric">Measures you can take to improve the building fabric</h3>

<p>The performance of the building fabric can be improved by:</p>

<ul>
<li>installing draught-proofing around windows and doors</li>
  <li>reducing heat lost through delivery doors and docking bays by using air-locks, PVC curtains, warm air curtains and motorised doors</li>
  <li>insulating the walls and the roof space, as well as internal and external pipework</li>
  <li>upgrading windows and doors to more energy-efficient alternatives and topping up insulation levels to modern standards where necessary</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="maintaining-the-energy-performance-of-the-building-fabric">Maintaining the energy performance of the building fabric</h3>

<p>You need to regularly maintain your buildings to ensure they remain as energy-efficient as possible. Make sure that all gaps in the building fabric are sealed as quickly as possible once they are identified. Consider having a maintenance schedule so that doors, windows and other heat-loss areas are checked on a regular basis. Remember to also check for damp, as this can damage the building fabric and reduce its insulating properties.</p>

<h3 id="improving-performance---sector-tips-4">Improving performance - sector tips</h3>

<p>Pig farms can use boxed creeps in farrowing pens to create a controllable environment for the piglets and allow better thermal insulation. Improving insulation in weaning rooms and kennels will also reduce your energy costs.</p>

<p>Horticulture farms can reduce air leaks from greenhouses by ensuring that ventilators close properly, replacing broken panes, sealing around heating pipes and keeping doors closed, and fitting automatic door closers.</p>

<p>For crop storage you can minimise leaks from doors, louvres and mixing boxes as well as from refrigeration condensate drains. You can also improve efficiency by increasing the level of insulation in a refrigerated crop store. <a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/Publications/pages/publicationdetail.aspx?id=CTS184">Find a case study showing how increasing crop store insulation can reduce energy costs by over 50% on the Carbon Trust website</a>.</p>
