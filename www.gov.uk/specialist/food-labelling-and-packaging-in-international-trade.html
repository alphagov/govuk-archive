<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide provides advice on food labelling and packaging for international traders. Foods intended for the UK and other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries must comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and national legislation. Controls can be complex and can change frequently to accommodate public health concerns - legislation is currently being revised for most types of food. For example, certain foods may be banned or restricted. Most food can move freely within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> once requirements are met. Food imported from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> must comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> food hygiene requirements and may also be subject to further <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> restrictions.</p>

<p>All the rules are aimed at protecting consumers and providing food traceability, which includes the right labelling and packaging requirements. This means that traders should see these labelling requirements as part of their requirement to provide an audit trail for their goods.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-food-labelling-in-the-uk-and-eu">Understanding food labelling in the UK and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Food labelling requirements are set out by European law and are currently implemented in individual member states by national legislation. Food destined for the UK must also comply with national provisions that apply to general and product-specific labelling. In the UK, local authorities enforce both national and international rules.</p>

<p>Goods imported into the UK from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> may be checked by the local authority or Port Health Authority. Certain products are subject to specific checks at import. </p>

<p>Once your goods are on sale in shops or supermarkets, environmental health or trading standards officers are also likely to check them. If your imported products are in breach of labelling and packaging requirements, action may be taken against you.</p>

<p>While the list below is compulsory for most imported foods, many types of food have extra requirements. For instance, traders must comply with the extra food labelling systems, such as health marks for meat, that will be consumed within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Traders must also check additional requirements for their type of goods.</p>

<h3 id="general-labelling-standards-for-the-uk-and-eu">General labelling standards for the UK and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Food sold to consumers or used in catering establishments must be marked with the following information:</p>

<ol>
<li>The name of the food. Some names, known as ‘legal names’, are prescribed by law and must be used according to regulations, such as ‘burger’, ‘sausage’, ‘jam’, ‘butter’ and others. Otherwise, a customary name, or one that consumers generally accept, such as ‘Bakewell tart’, may be used. If no legal or customary name exists, use a descriptive name that clearly explains what the product is.</li>
  <li>A list of ingredients, usually in descending order of their weight at the time they were used to prepare the product. Ingredients should be listed using the same name as if they were sold as foods themselves. There are special rules for flavourings and functional additives such as preservatives and colours. Some foods, such as unprepared fresh fruit and vegetables, do not need to list ingredients.</li>
  <li>The quantity of certain ingredients or categories of ingredients, usually the main ones or those used in the name. See below for details of the Quantitative Ingredient Declaration (<abbr title="Quantitative Ingredient Declaration">QUID</abbr>) rules that state the requirement to indicate the quantities of the main or key ingredients on the labels of food products sold in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</li>
  <li>The appropriate durability indication - the ‘use by’ date for highly perishable foods and the ‘best before’ date for others. ‘Use by’ dates are given in either day/month or day/month/year formats and indicate the date until which the food, if properly stored, is recommended for use. ‘Best before’ dates indicate the date until which the food will keep its properties if properly stored. Either give the date directly or indicate where it can be found, for example - ‘Best before: see date on lid’. Some products, including fresh fruit and vegetables, and alcoholic drinks with an alcohol by volume (abv) strength above 10 per cent do not need to be labelled with a durability indication.</li>
  <li>Any special storage conditions or conditions of use. Special storage conditions might include, for example, ‘store in a cool dry place’, ‘keep refrigerated’, ‘once opened, keep refrigerated and consume within 3 days’. Conditions of use might include, for example, ‘not suitable for frying’ or ‘shake well before use’. The label should also indicate whether the food is suitable for home freezing and give instructions where required, such as ‘freeze on day of purchase’.</li>
  <li>The name and address of the manufacturer or packer, or a seller established within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</li>
  <li>The place or country of origin (if failure to provide it might mislead the purchaser).</li>
  <li>Additional requirements where applicable, including the abv of alcoholic drinks, an indication that packaging gases have been used (eg ‘packaged in a protective atmosphere’), a warning of high caffeine content, labelling of sweeteners and glycyrrhizinic acid (a flavouring that masks bitterness) as well as lot or batch marking and weights and measures.</li>
  <li>Whether the food contains any of the following allergens - cereals containing gluten (including wheat, rye, barley and oats), crustaceans, molluscs, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybeans, lupin, milk, nuts, celery, mustard, sesame seeds, or sulphur dioxide and sulphites at more than 10 milligrams per kilogram or 10 milligrams per litre. The rules state that the allergen information must be shown in the ingredients list where one is used (‘may contain’ type statements and allergy boxes are voluntary).</li>
  <li>Indication if the food is specially prepared for people with gluten intolerance. The claims ‘gluten free’ or ‘very low gluten’ have very specific meanings and can be used only on certain foods. ‘Gluten free’ means that the product contains 20 parts of gluten per million or less. ‘Very low gluten’ may be used only on those products which are manufactured using a special type of starch that has been treated to take out almost all of the gluten (products in this category will have a higher level of gluten in them of up to 100 parts per million). This change applies to both pre-packed food and food sold loose and food producers have until 1 January 2012 to change their labels.</li>
  <li>Whether it contains or consists of genetically modified organisms (<abbr title="genetically modified organisms">GMOs</abbr>), or contains ingredients produced from <abbr title="genetically modified organisms">GMOs</abbr>. However, you do not have to label foods with <abbr title="genetically modified">GM</abbr> labelling if the food contains an accidental presence of <abbr title="genetically modified">GM</abbr> material from sources authorised for use in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> of 0.9 per cent or less.</li>
  <li>Whether it has or contains ingredients that have been irradiated.</li>
  <li>Instructions for use or cooking - these should be included whenever the consumer needs them in order to use the product as intended.</li>
</ol>
<p>The general labelling rules also outline requirements that labels on all food are indelible, clear and easy to read, as well as being easily understood by consumers.</p>

<p>As well as wine and spirits, specific labelling rules apply to these other foods, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>bread and flour</li>
  <li>cocoa and chocolate</li>
  <li>instant coffee</li>
  <li>evaporated and dried milk</li>
  <li>fruit juice</li>
  <li>honey</li>
  <li>infant formula</li>
  <li>jam</li>
  <li>meat products: sausages, burgers and pies</li>
  <li>natural mineral waters</li>
  <li>fish</li>
  <li>spreadable fats</li>
  <li>sugar</li>
  <li>food for ’parnuts’ (particular nutritional uses) - eg infant formula, baby foods, foods suitable for coeliacs (eg gluten-free and very low gluten)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nutritional labelling is voluntary, unless you are making a nutritional or health claim about the food, or vitamins and minerals have been voluntarily added to it. The European Commission (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) has issued a proposal for a new Food Information Regulation which includes provisions for nutrition labelling, although new law is not expected imminently.</p>

<p>Organic products have specific marking rules. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/organic-produce-how-to-become-an-importer">importing organic produce.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> general marketing standard requires most fruit and vegetables to be labelled with their country of origin. <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> specific marketing standards requires the following products to be labelled with country of origin, packer name and address, quality class and in some instances size/count and variety:</p>

<ul>
<li>fruits - apples, citrus fruit, kiwi fruit, peaches and nectarines, pears, strawberries, and table grapes</li>
  <li>vegetables and salads - lettuces, curly- and broad-leaved endives, sweet peppers and tomatoes</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/EF8772A06D88B2EC8025712A00439A2C?Opendocument">Read about horticultural marketing standards on the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<p>Specific <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> marketing and labelling standards also apply to:</p>

<ul>
<li>canned sardines and tuna</li>
  <li>olive oil</li>
  <li>eggs in their shell</li>
  <li>foods with protected names, such as Yorkshire Forced Rhubarb and West Country Cheddar</li>
</ul>
<p>Materials and articles in contact with food will need to be marked ‘Not suitable for food use’ if they are not meant for human consumption. Groundnuts (peanuts) need to be marked for further processing or for birdfeed if they are unsuitable for food use.</p>

<h3 id="food-colouring-warnings">Food colouring warnings</h3>

<p>If you are still using one or more of six food colourings being voluntarily phased out, you must, with a few exceptions, include a warning on products. In addition to the standard required information, labels must also have a warning using the following wording: ‘the name or E number of the colour(s)’ may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children’. The colours are:</p>

<ul>
<li>sunset yellow (E 110)</li>
  <li>quinoline yellow (E 104)</li>
  <li>carmoisine (E 122)</li>
  <li>allura red (E 129)</li>
  <li>tartrazine (E 102)</li>
  <li>ponceau 4R (E 124)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/labellingcoloursreg13332008.pdf">download guidance on the labelling of the food colours as set out in Regulation 1333/2008 from the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>) website (PDF, 144KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="quid-rules">
<abbr title="Quantitative Ingredient Declaration">QUID</abbr> rules</h3>

<p><abbr title="Quantitative Ingredient Declaration">QUID</abbr> rules refer to Quantitative Ingredient Declaration - the labelling requirement to indicate the quantities of principal or main ingredients for food products sold in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Declarations are required for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ingredients that form part of the name of the food, or that are usually associated with the food by consumers. For example, a product called ‘steak and kidney pie’ would need to indicate how much steak and kidney was in the product, while a ‘fish pie’ would need to indicate how much fish was included.</li>
  <li>Ingredients that are emphasised on the labelling, whether in words or with pictures. For example, a product label that stated ‘made with real cream’ would require a <abbr title="Quantitative Ingredient Declaration">QUID</abbr> declaration for the cream.</li>
  <li>Some products of animal origin (<abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>), including meat content for meat products sold loose and not pre-packed (such as butcher’s sausages).</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not need a <abbr title="Quantitative Ingredient Declaration">QUID</abbr> declaration if the quantity of the ingredient has to be listed anyway under <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation, or if the ingredient is used in a small quantity, for example as a flavouring. For example, ‘garlic bread’ does not need to state the quantity of garlic.</p>

<p><abbr title="Quantitative Ingredient Declaration">QUID</abbr> declarations are given as percentages, rounded to the nearest whole number, or to the nearest 0.5 if the proportion is below 5 per cent. The percentage is calculated by dividing the weight of the ingredient by the weight of all the ingredients included in the product. As far as possible, the declaration should reflect the amount of the ingredient at the time the food is prepared by the purchaser of the product.</p>

<p>The declaration should appear either next to the name of the food product, or in the list of ingredients at the relevant point.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-food-labelling-legislation">Changes to food labelling legislation</h3>

<p>In early 2008 the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> published a proposal to combine general food and nutrition labelling rules into a single text. Discussions are ongoing and any new legislation is unlikely to be agreed until later in 2011. Key areas in the proposal include:</p>

<ul>
<li>new requirements on how the nutritional value of food should be displayed</li>
  <li>a framework for providing key nutritional information on the front of the package </li>
  <li>the provision of allergen information labelling to cover non pre-packed food, including food sold in restaurants and other catering establishments</li>
  <li>a minimum font size</li>
  <li>tightening of country of origin rules</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-labelling-standards">Understanding labelling standards</h2>

<p>Although weight is not part of food labelling law, most food labels are required to indicate the weight of the product inside the package. Restrictions limiting the range of sizes that all pre-packaged goods could be packed in (with the exception of wines and spirits) no longer apply. Although goods can now be packed in any size, producers may choose to continue using traditional standard pack sizes.</p>

<p>There are a number of regulations covering food claims:</p>

<ol>
<li>All claims made such as ‘low fat’ and ‘helps maintain supple joints’, must comply with <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> Regulation 1924/2006 and be supported by scientific evidence. Claims must be on a permitted list and the product must meet set criteria. The Regulation also makes prescribed nutrition labelling compulsory on any product for which claims are made.</li>
  <li>You cannot claim food is ‘healthy’ or ‘good for you’ unless you can support it with approved evidence. If you add nutritional labelling you must use the prescribed format. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/food-labelling-and-packaging">labelling food products.</a>
</li>
  <li>Fortified food needs to comply with <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> Regulation 1925/2006, which puts in place specific labelling requirements for foods with added vitamins or minerals.</li>
  <li>Claims for ‘parnuts’ (particular nutritional uses) foods - those with a specific nutritional function, including infant formula, follow-on formula and baby foods - must comply with special regulations. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/food-labelling-and-packaging">labelling food products.</a>
</li>
  <li>Medicinal claims for food are illegal - you must not claim that food can treat, prevent or cure any disease or medical condition.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="revised-set-of-recommended-daily-allowances-rdas-for-vitamins-and-minerals">Revised set of recommended daily allowances (<abbr title="recommended daily allowances">RDAs</abbr>) for vitamins and minerals</h3>

<p>The Recommended Daily Allowance (<abbr title="recommended daily allowance">RDA</abbr>) for vitamins and minerals have changed. From 30 October 2009, a revised set of <abbr title="recommended daily allowances">RDAs</abbr> for vitamins and minerals has been introduced and these rules are mandatory as of 31 October 2012. The new amounts are set out in the two Schedules to the Food Labelling (Nutrition Information) (England) Regulations 2009. </p>

<h3 id="the-definition-of-fibre">The definition of fibre</h3>

<p>Fibre has specific definitions with which you must comply. New energy conversion factors (<abbr title="energy conversion factors">ECFs</abbr>) for fibre and erythritol - have been introduced. <abbr title="energy conversion factors">ECFs</abbr> are used by food manufacturers to calculate values in their products’ energy declarations. These rules are in mandatory as of 31 October 2012</p>

<p>So that food manufacturers’ claims about fibre are consistent, in the future this will be defined as ‘carbohydrate polymers with three or more monomeric units, which are neither digested nor absorbed in the human small intestine and belong to the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>edible carbohydrate polymers naturally occurring in the food as consumed</li>
  <li>edible carbohydrate polymers which have been obtained from food raw material by physical, enzymatic or chemical means and which have a beneficial physiological effect demonstrated by generally accepted scientific evidence</li>
  <li>edible synthetic carbohydrate polymers which have a beneficial physiological effect demonstrated by generally accepted scientific evidence’</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ecfs-for-fibre-and-erythritol">
<abbr title="energy conversion factors">ECFs</abbr> for fibre and erythritol</h3>

<p>From 30 October 2009, <abbr title="energy conversion factors">ECFs</abbr> will be introduced as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>fibre - 2 kcal/g (8 kJ/g)</li>
  <li>erythritol - 0 kcal/g (0 kJ/g)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have until 31 October 2012 to ensure that your products comply with the new rules.</p>

<p>Containers of raw milk should be marked ‘This milk has not been heat-treated and may therefore contain organisms harmful to health’. Foods that consist of skimmed milk together with non-milk fat, or that can be used as milk substitutes, but are not intended for infants, should be prominently marked with a warning that they are not suitable for babies.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directive 2000/13 has been implemented in the UK. These laws indicate that food labelling should not mislead people about any aspect of a food product, make false claims about its properties or suggest that it has special characteristics when, in fact, all similar foods have those characteristics.</p>

<p>For fresh fruit and vegetables specific <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> marketing and labelling standards now cover only these products:</p>

<ul>
<li>fruits - apples, citrus fruit, kiwi fruit, peaches and nectarines, pears, strawberries, and table grapes</li>
  <li>vegetables and salads - lettuces, curly- and broad-leaved endives, sweet peppers and tomatoes</li>
</ul>
<p>Labelling required includes country of origin, packer name and address, quality class and for some products a size/count and/or a variety/type.</p>

<p>Many other fresh fruit and vegetables are covered by the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> general marketing standard and require country of origin labelling.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/EF8772A06D88B2EC8025712A00439A2C?Opendocument">Read about horticultural marketing standards on the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="format-and-placing-of-labelling-information">Format and placing of labelling information</h3>

<p>The information required must be given on the packaging itself or on a label attached to it or visible through it. It must not be obscured by the packaging design. Labels must be clear and easy to read, indelible, easy to understand and easily visible. The <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> recommends that essential information should be given in a font size of 8 point or above. The clearest way to format text is in black on a white background, using open fonts, such as Arial.</p>

<p>The way information is arranged on a label is important. Key information such as the name of the food, its durability indication, alcoholic strength, net quantity and any relevant milk warnings must appear in the same field of vision.</p>

<p>If food products are sold or transported in outer packaging, it should include the name of the food, its durability indication and details of the manufacturer, packer or seller.</p>

<p>If you are exporting food outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and intend to make it available for sale, you can contact the country’s embassy (specifically the Commercial Attache) in the UK for help with checking if there are export restrictions, and any special labelling or packaging requirements. There are restrictions on food exports to the USA. Traders must register with the US Food and Drug Administration and must operate through a US-registered agent.</p>

<p>Rules of origin are used to determine the national or territorial provenance of goods for trade purposes. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/rules-of-origin">rules of origin for imported and exported goods</a>.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-extra-food-labelling-systems-within-the-eu">Understanding extra food labelling systems within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Traders must comply with extra food labelling systems, health marks and Quantitative Ingredient Declarations (<abbr title="Quantitative Ingredient Declarations">QUIDs</abbr>), for goods that will be consumed in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. </p>

<p>The following guidelines apply only to imports into England and Wales. Scottish importers should contact Scotland’s Environmental and Rural Services on Tel 08452 30 20 50, while those from Northern Ireland should contact their local district council.</p>

<p>Health marks are applied to red meat carcasses and wholesale cuts to show that they are fit for human consumption. They are also an important way to ensure that meat products are traceable, so that if a food safety emergency occurs, problems can be quickly traced and, if necessary, foods withdrawn from the market. The health mark indicates that red meat carcasses and wholesale cuts have been subject to pre- and post-mortem inspection and are fit for human consumption at the time of inspection.</p>

<p>The health mark itself is an oval mark at least 6.5 centimetres by 4.5 centimetres high, and lists the following information in clearly legible type:</p>

<ul>
<li>the country in which the establishment that prepared the meat (slaughterhouse) is located</li>
  <li>the approval number of the slaughterhouse</li>
</ul>
<p>The health mark may also include an indication of the official veterinarian who carried out the health inspection of the meat.</p>

<p>Other meat products that do not require a health mark are given an identification mark or ‘ID mark’ indicating their origin. The identification mark, applied by the food business operator, indicates that white meat, all cut meat and processed meat has been produced in accordance with the legal requirements. It should include the country of origin, the name of the establishment where the product was made and its approval number. Unlike health marks, ID marks do not indicate that any health inspection has been carried out.</p>

<p><abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> cannot be sold in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without either a health mark or an identification mark.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-labelling-standards-for-horticultural-imports">Understanding labelling standards for horticultural imports</h2>

<p>Marketing standards are enforced by the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> general marketing standards require most fruit and vegetables to be labelled with their country of origin. The standard requires produce to be intact, clean, sufficiently mature, free from rot and free from pests and pest damage. However, several common products are not covered by the general marketing standard.</p>

<p>They include:</p>

<ul>
<li>potatoes</li>
  <li>coconuts</li>
  <li>sugarcane</li>
  <li>sweetcorn</li>
  <li>wild mushrooms</li>
  <li>chilli peppers</li>
  <li>capers</li>
  <li>Brazil nuts</li>
  <li>bitter or shelled almonds</li>
  <li>shelled hazelnuts and walnuts</li>
  <li>olives</li>
  <li>pine nuts</li>
  <li>bananas</li>
  <li>saffron</li>
  <li>ginger</li>
  <li>peanuts</li>
  <li>sweet potatoes and yams</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> specific marketing standards cover these products:</p>

<ul>
<li>fruits - apples, citrus fruit, kiwi fruit, peaches and nectarines, pears, strawberries, and table grapes</li>
  <li>vegetables and salads - lettuces, curly- and broad-leaved endives, sweet peppers and tomatoes</li>
</ul>
<p>Labelling required includes country of origin, packer name and address, quality class and for some products a size/count and/or a variety/type. </p>

<p>If you import or export any of the fruit and vegetables listed above with specific marketing standards into or from the UK from or to any country outside of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for selling fresh, you will require a Certificate of Conformity before your goods can be released into or from free circulation within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. You do not require a certificate if the goods are to be used for processing, or for most other fruit, vegetables, nuts and herbs.</p>

<p>However, several common products are not covered by these new standards. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1077717216&amp;r.l3=1079819216&amp;topicId=1079819372">trading in fruit, vegetables and plant products</a>.</p>

<p>Traders in England and Wales must obtain a Certificate of Conformity through a Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates (<abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> only applies to Scotland and Northern Ireland businesses whose imports arrive via either England or Wales. For direct imports from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Scottish importers should contact the Scottish Government Rural Directorate on Tel 0131 244 6015. Importers from Northern Ireland should contact the DARD Helpline on Tel 028 9052 4999. </p>

<p>When importing, you must clearly label your shipping packaging with detailed information about the goods, including their country of origin and, where applicable, variety/type, size, weight, and details of the packer.</p>

<p>If you import nuts there are emergency controls to consider. For further information see the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1077717216&amp;r.l3=1079819216&amp;topicId=1079819218">working with the Port Health Authorities.</a></p>

<p>If you do not comply with <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> marketing standards, you may have to remove your goods from sale, re-label, re-sort them, send them for industrial processing or dump them.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-food-packaging">Understanding food packaging</h2>

<p>The packaging you choose for your food goods must provide enough information for handlers to move your goods safely and hygienically. You must also make sure that basic standards for all packaging used for importing and exporting are met. See the guides on how to label and package goods being shipped out of the UK and <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/food-labelling-and-packaging">packaging foods</a>.</p>

<p>Three types of packaging are used for food. Transport or export packaging is the outermost layer, which protects the product during transit. Outer packaging is an intermediate layer, for example a box containing several bags, tins or pouches of product, which is sometimes used to display goods in a retail environment. Sales packaging is the immediate layer of packaging around the goods.</p>

<p>There are a number of requirements in <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> Regulation No 1935/2004 that cover packaging for foods and other materials. As well as dealing with packaging in direct contact with food, the rules cover packaging capable of affecting food through the migration of its constituents into the food. Key rules include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aluminium is considered safe for food contact, although it may not be suitable for highly acidic foods such as tomatoes and soft fruits.</li>
  <li>Plastics are subject to an overall migration limit of 10 milligrams per square decimetre of plastic surface area or per kilogram of food. There are also many specific migration limits that apply to individual substances contained in the regulations, whether they are plastics monomers or plastics additives that are used to achieve a particular technical effect. There are also rules about the use of declarations of legal compliance that apply to packaging moving up and down the supply chain.</li>
  <li>Other specific rules apply to regenerated cellulose film, ceramics, plasticisers in seals for food containers, certain epoxy derivatives used in coatings, adhesives and plastics when used in contact with food.</li>
  <li>New rules apply to contamination from chemicals, including mycotoxin (mould-related) contamination (in, for example, cereals and dried fruit) and radiological contamination from the use of pesticides and animal medicines, as well as nitrates from green, leafy vegetables.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overriding rule is that any packaging materials must not allow their constituents to migrate into the food in quantities that could harm human health or affect the nature or quality of the food. To this end, for those that manufacture or convert packaging materials into particular food packaging, there are also rules about the documentation of good manufacturing practice within the business.</p>

<p>Packaging that meets the requirements for food contact is labelled ‘for food contact’ and may also bear a specific symbol resembling a wine glass and a fork.</p>

<p>New types of packaging material that actively maintain or improve the condition of food, as opposed to simply containing it, are now available. Other materials, known as ‘intelligent packaging’, monitor the condition of the food. These active packaging materials must comply with regulations on food additives, and these and the ‘intelligent’ packaging technologies should not be used to disguise problems such as spoilage. Information should be given on the package to help consumers use them safely.</p>

<p><abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> are subject to extra packaging rules. You must ensure that your products have an identification mark applied before they go into transit. Depending on the product, you can apply the mark to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the wrapping</li>
  <li>the packaging</li>
  <li>a label affixed to the product, the wrapping or the packaging</li>
</ul>
<p>For further information see the guide to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/animal-products-import-and-export"><abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> can advise you on the detail of the legal requirements with which food packaging must comply.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-import-and-export-process-requirements-for-food-labelling-and-packaging">Understanding import and export process requirements for food labelling and packaging</h2>

<p>If you are moving food between countries within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, this is not officially regarded as importation, as it’s in free circulation. Your products can move freely between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states and will not be subject to checks at ports. However, your products must comply with current <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations and you must be able to provide an audit trail for your goods.</p>

<h3 id="imports-from-outside-the-eu">Imports from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Traders importing food from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> need to ensure that they comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and UK regulations on hygiene and safety, and labelling and food composition regulations. If you fail to comply, your shipment could be detained and/or destroyed, and you could incur additional costs. Where foods are pre-packed outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> the importer must ensure the packaging complies with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules on food packaging. </p>

<p>Food <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> - including meat and poultry, meat products, fish and shellfish, eggs, milk and other dairy products, animal fats and offal - can only be imported from third countries that have been approved by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. The products must usually come from approved premises/establishments, be accompanied by a health certificate and comply with animal and public health conditions.</p>

<p>Certain <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> categories do not as yet have approved establishment <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> list codes. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>eggs and egg products</li>
  <li>snails’ and frogs’ legs</li>
  <li>rendered fats and greaves</li>
  <li>collagen</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/establishments/third_country/new_estab_lists_en.htm">find information on the different <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> codes and treatments on the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> can only enter the UK through a port or airport with a Border Inspection Post (<abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>) approved for the category of product to be imported. <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> need to be notified of the arrival of the product before its physical arrival at the port/airport. Your products must be labelled correctly and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system must have been used throughout the food handling process. </p>

<p>Accompanying documentation will be checked, the identity will be verified and a physical check will be carried out on a prescribed percentage of products. If your products fail any of these checks, they will not be allowed into the UK and may be destroyed. If your products pass the checks, you will be issued with a completed Common Veterinary Entry Document. From this point, your <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> can move freely within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. For further information on <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> see the guide to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/animal-products-import-and-export"><abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>.</a></p>

<p>Some emergency import controls are also in place for other types of food, to reduce known health risks. If these are in force, Port Health Authorities and local authorities at ports and airports of entry will usually carry out checks and sampling of imported foods. These measures may require that certain products from certain countries have to be accompanied by a health certificate and/or results of analysis for a particular hazard. <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/imports/#branch2">Read information on controlled products on the <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> website.</a></p>
