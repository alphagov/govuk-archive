<h2>Part-time students</h2>
<p>If you’re a part-time student applying for 2011 to 2012 you need to apply for a Fee Grant. </p>

<p>This is paid directly to your university or college and doesn’t have to be paid back.</p>

<p>How much you get depends on your circumstances, household income and course ‘intensity’ (how long the course takes to complete compared with an equivalent full-time course).</p>

  </header><p>Student loans and grants are available to help with living costs. </p>

<h2>Full-time students</h2>
<p>Full-time students can get the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintenance Loan</li>
  <li>Maintenance Grant</li>
</ul>
<h3>Maintenance Loan</h3>
<p>The Maintenance Loan has to be repaid. How much you get depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>your household income</li>
  <li>where you live</li>
  <li>how much Maintenance Grant you get</li>
  <li>whether you’re in your final year (when you get slightly less)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get 72% of the loan without having your household income assessed - to get the full loan your household income needs to be assessed. </p>

<p>You can get the following:</p>

<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Where you live when studying</strong></td>
      <td><strong>The maximum loan</strong></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>At home</td>
      <td>£3,838</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Away from home outside London</td>
      <td>£4,950</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Away from home in London</td>
      <td>£6,928</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The money is paid to the university or college at the beginning of term once you’ve registered on your course.</p>

<h3>Maintenance Grant</h3>
<p>The Maintenance Grant doesn’t have to be repaid. How much you get depends on your household income so you need to have this assessed when you apply.</p>

<p>You can get:</p>

<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Household income</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Maintenance Grant</strong></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Under £25,000</td>
      <td>£2,906</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>£25,001-£50,020</td>
      <td>Partial grant</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Over £50,020</td>
      <td>No grant</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>If you get a Maintenance Grant you get a smaller Maintenance Loan, meaning you have less to repay. </p>

<p>The money is paid into your bank account each term once you’ve registered on your course.</p>

</ul>

</article><article id="repayments"><header><h1>Part 7: Repayments</h1>
  </header><h2>When repayments start</h2>
<p>You start paying back your student loan in the April after leaving your course when you earn more than £15,000 a year. The threshold will increase to £15,795 from 6 April 2012. </p>

<p>If your income falls below £15,000 a year, your repayments stop.</p>

<p>Different rules apply if your course starts after 1 September 2012 - see <a href="/paying-back-student-loan" title="Paying back your student loan">paying back your student loan</a>.</p>

<h2>How much interest you pay</h2>
<p>You’re charged interest on your loan from the first payment until the loan is paid back in full. This means the amount you pay back is more than the amount you took out in loans.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>For the year starting 1 September 2011 the interest rate is 1.5% a year.</p>
</div>

<h2>Your monthly repayments</h2>
<p>You pay 9% of your income over £15,000.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> if you earn £21,000 this is £6,000 over the £15,000 threshold. You pay 9% of £6,000 which is £540 per year or £45 per month.</p>

<h2>How you repay your loan</h2>

<h3>If you’re an employee</h3>

<p>Your employer will work out your repayment and take it off your salary every month along with your tax through Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>). <a rel="external" href="http://www.studentloanrepayment.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=93,6678477&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL" title="repaying your loan through PAYE">Find out more about repaying your loan through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>.</a> </p>

<p>Check your pay slip to see how much has been taken to pay your student loan.</p>

<p>If you haven’t worked since leaving your course or earn less than £15,000, you won’t make any repayments.</p>

<h3>If you’re self-employed</h3>
<p>You need to work out and make your own repayments if you earn more than £15,000 a year. </p>

<p>This is like working out your tax and National Insurance payments. <a rel="external" href="http://www.studentloanrepayment.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=93,6678530&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL" title="repaying your loan through self assessment">Find out more about repaying your loan through self assessment.</a> </p>
