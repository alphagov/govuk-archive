  </header><p>If you drive a goods vehicle or a passenger-carrying vehicle you must follow the rules on how many hours you can drive and the breaks that you need to take.</p>

<p>There are 3 sets of rules that could apply to your journey:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/drivers-hours/eu-rules" title="EU rules on drivers' hours">EU rules</a></li>
  <li><a href="/drivers-hours/aetr-rules" title="AETR rules on drivers' hours"><abbr title="European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews Engaged in International Road Transport">AETR</abbr> rules</a></li>
  <li><a href="/drivers-hours/gb-domestic-rules" title="GB Domestic rules on drivers' hours">GB Domestic rules</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The rules that apply depend on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the type of vehicle you’re driving</li>
  <li>which country you’re driving in</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide highlights the main rules. For more detailed information you should read the following guides.</p>

</article><article id="rules-for-employers"><header><h1>Part 2: Rules for employers</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer, you must monitor your mobile workers’ working time and do what you can to make sure the limits aren’t exceeded. You must record working time and keep the records for at least 2 years.</p>

<p>Mobile workers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>drivers - including employed drivers, own-account drivers, and agency drivers</li>
  <li>members of the vehicle crew, eg a second driver on a coach</li>
  <li>anyone else who is part of the travelling staff, eg a bus conductor, a drayman, or a security guard aboard a vehicle carrying high-value goods</li>
</ul>
<p>Workers who only occasionally carry out activities covered by EU drivers’ hours rules are not covered by mobile worker regulations. They need to follow <a href="/maximum-weekly-working-hours" title="Maximum weekly working hours">other rules</a>.</p>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) enforces the regulations. If you break the rules you can be given:</p>

<ul>
<li>an improvement notice - setting out the changes you need to make by a certain date</li>
  <li>a prohibition notice - this requires you to stop a dangerous activity, or to start complying with the regulations</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> takes a ‘proportionate’ approach to enforcement. Formal action is usually taken only against persistent or serious offenders. </p>


</article><article id="goods-vehicles"><header><h1>Part 3: Goods vehicles</h1>
  </header><p>The rules that apply to goods vehicles depend on the weight of your vehicle, the country you’re driving in and what you’re using the vehicle for.</p>

  </header><p>The GB Domestic drivers’ hours rules apply to most passenger-carrying vehicles and goods vehicles that don’t have to follow the EU rules. </p>

<p>GB Domestic rules apply in Great Britain - there are separate rules in <a rel="external" href="http://www.dvtani.gov.uk/publications/atoz.asp#D" title="Link to listing of drivers' hours guides on the Driver and Vehicle Agency, Northern Ireland website">Northern Ireland.</a></p>

<h2>Goods vehicles and passenger-carrying vehicles</h2>

<h3>Daily driving limit</h3>

<p>You must not drive for more than 10 hours in a day. The daily driving limit applies to time spent at the wheel actually driving on a public road. Off-road driving counts as duty time.</p>

<h3>Duty time</h3>

<p>If you work as a driver for a company, duty time is any working time. If you’re self-employed, duty time is only time you spend driving the vehicle or doing other work related to the vehicle or its load.</p>

<h3>Daily duty limit</h3>

<p>You must not be on duty for more than 11 hours in any working day. This limit doesn’t apply on any working day when you don’t drive.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must <a href="/tachographs" title="Tachographs - the basics">record your hours</a> on a weekly record sheet or on a tachograph.</p>
</div>

<h2>Passenger-carrying vehicles only</h2>

<h3>Breaks and continuous driving</h3>

<p>After 5.5 hours of driving you must take a break of at least 30 minutes when you must be able to rest and take refreshment.</p>

<p>Or, within any period of 8.5 hours, you must take at least 45 minutes in breaks. You must have a break of at least 30 minutes at the end of this period, unless it’s the end of the working day.</p>

<h3>Length of working day (‘spreadover’)</h3>

<p>You must not work more than 16 hours in any one day - including non driving work and any times when you’re off duty.</p>

<h3>Daily rest periods</h3>

<p>You must take a rest of 10 hours between 2 working days. This can be reduced to 8.5 hours up to 3 times a week.</p>

<h3>Fortnightly rest periods</h3>

<p>Every 2 weeks you must take at least one period of 24 hours off duty.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A fixed week is from 00:00am on Monday to 23:59pm on the next Sunday.</p>
</div>

<h2>Exemptions</h2>

<p>The GB Domestic rules don’t apply if:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>you don’t drive on the public road, eg if you drive as part of work in road maintenance, quarrying, construction work, civil engineering works</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you drive for less than 4 hours in any day</p>
  </li>
</ul></article><article id="driving-under-both-eu-and-gb-domestic-rules"><header><h1>Part 9: Driving under both EU and GB Domestic rules</h1>
  </header><p>If you work partly under EU/<abbr title="European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews Engaged in International Road Transport">AETR</abbr> rules and partly under GB Domestic rules during a day or a week you need to know the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>driving under EU rules counts towards the driving and duty limits under GB domestic rules</li>
  <li>on any days that you drive under EU rules you must take EU daily rest periods, as well as a weekly rest period</li>
  <li>you can’t count the time you spend driving under EU rules as an off-duty period under GB Domestic rules</li>
  <li>driving and other duty under GB Domestic rules count as ‘attendance at work’, not as a break or rest period under EU rules</li>
</ul>
<h2>Driving limits</h2>

<p>You must follow the GB Domestic limit of a maximum of 10 hours driving a day. But at any time when you’re actually driving under the EU rules you must follow all the rules on EU driving limits.</p>

<h2>Other duty limits</h2>

<p>You must follow the GB Domestic limit of a maximum of 11 hours on duty.</p>

<h2>Rest periods and breaks</h2>

<p>You must follow the EU rules on rest periods and breaks on days and weeks when you drive under EU rules.</p>

<p>You don’t need to take a weekly rest period in a fixed week where you don’t drive under EU rules. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A fixed week is from 00:00am on Monday to 11:59pm on the next Sunday.</p>
