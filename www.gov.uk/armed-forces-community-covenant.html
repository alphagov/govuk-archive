<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Community covenants complement, at a local level, the armed forces covenant, which outlines the moral obligation between the nation, the government and the armed forces. The aim of the community covenant is to encourage local communities to support the service community in their area and promote understanding and awareness among the public of issues affecting the armed forces community.</p>

<p>Many people have become involved in supporting the service community through service charities, or more recently by participating in Armed Forces Day. They have shown their support through fundraising, military celebrations and open days, attending homecoming parades and repatriation ceremonies and offering commercial discounts. Even simple demonstrations of support, such as displaying the Armed Forces Day window sticker in cars and businesses, have had a positive effect and boosted the morale of our armed forces community. The community covenant scheme aims to build on this local level of support.</p>

<h3 id="the-aims-of-the-armed-forces-community-covenant-are-to">The aims of the armed forces community covenant are to:</h3>

<ul>
<li>encourage local communities to support the armed forces community in their areas
nurture public understanding and awareness among the public of issues affecting the armed forces community</li>
  <li>recognise and remember the sacrifices faced by the armed forces community</li>
  <li>encourage activities which help to integrate the armed forces community into local life</li>
  <li>to encourage the armed forces community to help and support the wider community, whether through participation in events and joint projects, or other forms of engagement</li>
</ul>
<p>Local authorities and the armed forces community are encouraged to work together to establish a community covenant in their area.</p>

<p>Community covenants may look quite different from one location to another. This is a scheme where one size does not fit all, and the nature of the support offered will be determined by both need and capacity. It is expected that most community covenants will be led at local authority level. However unitary authorities and individual towns may also wish to have a community covenant and this is equally welcome.</p>

<p>This pledge sets out what a community covenant seeks to achieve in a particular area and, where possible, will be signed by representatives from all parts of the community. In most cases the lead signatories will be a senior representative from the local authority and one from the services who will sign on behalf of the armed forces community (although the pledge may also be signed by those representing veterans’ or families groups, especially in areas without a large serving presence).</p>

<p>If you are interested in signing your own community covenant please see the template and guidelines available at <a href="/government/publications/community-covenant-pledge" title="community covenant pledge">community covenant pledge</a> and to stay updated on the work of the community covenant check out our quarterly <a href="/government/publications/the-community-covenant-e-newsletternewsletter" title="community covenant e-newsletter">community covenant e-newsletter</a> </p>

<h2 id="community-covenant-grant-scheme">Community covenant grant scheme</h2>

<p>The community covenants are supported by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/armed-forces-community-covenant-grant-scheme" title="Armed force community grant scheme">community covenant grant scheme</a> which has been established to financially support projects, at the local level, which strengthen the ties or the mutual understanding between members of the armed forces community and the wider community in which they live. </p>

<h2 id="applying-for-a-covenant-grant">Applying for a covenant grant</h2>

<p>The next community covenant grant scheme panel will sit on 14 March 2013 with an <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> deadline for applications of 28 February 2013. Please note that your local community covenant partnership may have timelines of their own. </p>

<p>The grant scheme will consider applications for projects that deliver tangible results and meet the overall aims of the community covenant scheme. An application for funding can be submitted by any part of the community, this might include volunteer groups, charities, public bodies such as schools, and so on.</p>

<p><a href="government/publications/armed-forces-community-covenant-grant-scheme" title="community covenant grant terms and conditions and application form">Community covenant grant terms and conditions and application form</a></p>

<h2 id="grant-panels">Grant panels</h2>

<p>Grant panels are now held on a quarterly basis throughout the year, so that we can consider more bids at more regular intervals.</p>

<p>The panels include, in addition to members of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s Armed Forces Covenant team, representatives from the Treasury, the Single Services’ Families Federations and local councils.</p>

<p>Please note that all bids must be approved by the local community covenant partnership. They may have timelines of their own to which you will need to adhere.</p>

<p>Applicants should ensure that bids are signed off by members of the local community covenant partnership so that we know the bid has been endorsed. This delays our ability to provide a response on whether or not the bid has been successful. We would expect the armed forces signatory to be at, or around, OF5 level (Captain-RN, Colonel, Group Captain) where possible.</p>

<p>Once a bid has been received by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> it is allocated a reference number. Please quote this number in any subsequent correspondence.</p>
