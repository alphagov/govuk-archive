<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The European Community (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) has rules for establishing the country of origin of imported and exported goods. You will need them to classify goods manufactured in more than one country.</p>

<p>As a customs union the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> applies a common customs duty to goods imported from outside the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>. However, in practice, trade agreements between the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> and third countries, regional trade blocs and free trade areas determine the rate of duty and customs conditions. Some goods imported from or exported to certain countries will qualify for preferential treatment - eg lower or nil customs duty, whereas others will have non-preferential status and attract full excise.</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-origin-of-goods">Defining the origin of goods</h2>

<p>The rate of duty that must be paid on your goods will depend on three elements - the type of goods, the country the goods are being imported into and where they are judged to have ‘originated’ from. The first step is to clarify the origin of the goods.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> has trading agreements with certain non-<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> countries and regional trading blocs or free trade areas. Once you have determined origin you will be on your way to classifying your goods and establishing whether an agreement is in place with the country or countries with which you wish to trade. </p>

<p>Where an agreement exists, you will need to check whether your goods qualify for any preferential treatment - eg reduced or nil rate of duty, which that agreement might allow.</p>

<h3 id="defining-the-origin">Defining the origin</h3>

<p>There are two main categories of origin in the rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>goods wholly obtained or produced in a single country</li>
  <li>goods whose production involved materials from more than one country</li>
</ul>
<p>This second category is the more complex as there are several criteria to consider - eg the origins of the materials, the country in which the final substantial production phase took place and the value the working and processing in each country has added.</p>

<p>If a product is manufactured entirely in the EU and is exported to a country with which there is a preferential arrangement it may attract lower or nil rates of duty when it is imported into the destination country.</p>

<p>However, if some of the components are manufactured in the EU but components are added and the product is assembled in another country it may be judged that the product originates from the country where it is assembled. The duty requirement will depend on the arrangements between the country in which the product was assembled and the country into which it will be imported.</p>

<h3 id="getting-help">Getting help</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">find commodity codes and other measures on the free online UK Trade Tariff</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you are importing goods you can contact the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> VAT helpline on 0845 010 9000.</p>

<p>If you are exporting goods, you should check with your customer, the customs authorities in your customer’s country or the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>) overseas trade division.</p>

<h2 id="tariff-preferences">Tariff preferences</h2>

<p>Once you have clarified the origin of the goods you’re exporting or importing, you can find out if they qualify for preferential treatment under a tariff preference scheme.</p>

<p>There are two types of scheme:</p>

<ul>
<li>autonomous or non-reciprocal schemes are only for imports into the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> under the Generalised System of Preferences (<abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>reciprocal schemes applying to both imports to the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> and exports from it</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, any preferential rate of duty will depend on there being preferential coverage for goods of that type between the importing and exporting countries - or between the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> and a third country - and the product:</p>

<ul>
<li>meeting its relevant rule of origin</li>
  <li>being wholly produced in the preference country or substantially manufactured there according to particular rules</li>
  <li>not being subject to a quota which would limit the quantity of the product that can be brought in under preference</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have established the origin of the goods you can check their customs classification which will show you if the goods qualify for a preference scheme. See classification of goods.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the free online UK Trade Tariff</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You can find an alphabetical list of all the countries that benefit from preferential treatment in Volume 1, Part 7 of the Tariff.</p>

<p>The UK Trade Tariff is the most up-to-date source of information on preferential agreements and the Commodity Code. It will also show if your product is liable to trade protection measures such as anti-dumping duties or Common Agricultural Policy charges which are often determined by the product’s origin.</p>

<p>If you’re an exporter check with your customers and the customs authorities in the customer’s market. You must also comply with general export procedures. For more information on these and how they apply to you see the guides on exporting your goods outside the EU and dispatching your goods within the EU.</p>

<p>If you’re an importer check with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. It is the importer’s responsibility to ensure that the correct amount of duty is paid. You’ll be liable for any unpaid or incorrectly paid duty for up to three years after the product has been imported.</p>

<h2 id="proving-goods-of-preferential-origin">Proving goods of preferential origin</h2>

<p>If the goods you’re exporting have preferential origin they are likely to attract reduced or nil rates of duty when they enter your customer’s country. As an exporter it is your responsibility to ensure that the rules of preferential origin have been followed correctly.</p>

<p>If you’re exporting you should check with the customs authorities in the country you are selling to and find out what preferences are available. You can also check with <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you’re importing goods of preferential origin you are likely to pay duty on the goods at a reduced or nil rate. However you must be sure that the paperwork has been correctly processed. You can be liable for unpaid or incorrectly paid duty for up to three years.</p>

<p>You’ll need to prove to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> that you are entitled to claim preference for the goods that are being exported or imported. The type of proof needed depends on the type of goods and the country to which they’re being exported.</p>

<p>In particular, you should check if the preference scheme is autonomous or reciprocal - that is, whether it applies to imports only or to both imports and exports. This will determine which type of certification you will require. </p>

<p>If you’re regularly exporting or importing you could consider applying for Binding Origin Information (<abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr>). This is a legally binding document from customs that clarifies the origin of your goods and can save time and money for regular exporters and importers. It is recognised and legally valid across the EU.</p>

<h2 id="binding-origin-information">Binding Origin Information</h2>

<p><abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> is a written decision by a customs authority that confirms the origin of specific goods. It is valid for three years and is legally recognised across the EU.</p>

<h3 id="advantages-of-holding-boi-for-exports-and-imports">Advantages of holding <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> for exports and imports</h3>

<p>A <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> is legally binding across all EU member states so if your goods move within the EU before they reach their destination holding <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> can minimise the chance of local customs challenging the origin of the goods while in transit.</p>

<p>If the origin of your goods is not straightforward holding <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> can prevent you from having to prove the origin of the goods repeatedly during trading. If any change in EU law makes your <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> invalid you can still continue to fulfil existing contracts for up to six months.</p>

<p>You can hold a <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> whether you’re exporting or importing goods. However, only the owner of the <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> can use it. For example, if you hold a <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> for goods you export, your customers cannot use it unless they’ve obtained one themselves.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-obtain-boi">How to obtain <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You can apply to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> for <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr>. There is no charge for issuing a <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> although you may have to pay any costs for specialist analysis of goods or expert advice if <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> need it to make a decision. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageContactUs_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000254&amp;propertyType=document">Find information about <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> in Notice 831 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageMySite_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000367&amp;propertyType=document">find out how to apply for <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr> on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="managing-certification-for-preferential-origin">Managing certification for preferential origin</h2>

<p>Goods of preferential origin (attracting reduced or nil duty) must be certified before they leave the exporting country. Retrospective certificates can be issued under exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>The certification needed depends on whether the preference scheme in the destination country is an autonomous one (applying to imports only) or reciprocal (applies to both imports and exports between the two countries).</p>

<p>Check with customs authorities in the goods’ destination country or the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> overseas trade division. </p>

<p>It’s the exporter’s responsibility to ensure that all paperwork relating to each consignment of goods is accurate and authentic.</p>

<h3 id="autonomous-schemes">Autonomous schemes</h3>

<p>You must ensure the goods you want to import are covered by a <abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr> (generalised system of preferences) Form A. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_024787&amp;propertyType=document">Read guidance on ensuring your Form A is technically correct on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>This is a certificate of preferential origin and must be stamped and signed by the customs authority in the exporting country. Each consignment of goods you import needs a separate certificate and each certificate is valid for ten months from the date of issue.</p>

<h3 id="reciprocal-schemes">Reciprocal schemes</h3>

<p>Most commonly, goods are covered by Form EUR1 provided by the exporter and stamped and signed by the customs authorities in the exporting country. <a rel="external" href="http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/docimages/1292.pdf">Download guidance on creating and filling in a Form EUR1 from the London Chamber of Commerce website (PDF, 53K)</a>.</p>

<p>In most cases, each form or declaration must only be used for one consignment of goods and is valid for four, five, or ten months from the date of issue, depending on the country to which the goods are being exported.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the exporter can use a legally approved form of words to declare on the invoice that the goods qualify for preferential origin status. There is a value limit on such exports - unless the exporter is approved by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>For both schemes, you still need to use classification codes on the customs paperwork that accompanies the shipment as they are also used to collate international trade statistics.</p>

<h3 id="help-for-regular-exporters">Help for regular exporters</h3>

<p>If you are a regular exporter you can apply to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to become an Approved Exporter. This entitles you to put the required preference declaration on the invoice and removes the requirement for an EUR1 Certificate. You can call the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> VAT helpline on 0845 010 9000 for further information.</p>

<p>You may be able to speed regular shipments of identical goods through customs by using <abbr title="Binding Origin Information">BOI</abbr>. </p>

<p>If you are taking your first steps as an importer or exporter be aware that you have to be registered as such. See Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) Scheme.</p>

<h3 id="non-preferential-certification">Non-preferential certification</h3>

<p>European Community Certificates of Origin (non-preferential origin) are issued by local Chambers of Commerce which are authorised by <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> on recommendation by the British Chambers of Commerce (<abbr title="British Chambers of Commerce">BCC</abbr>). This service is available to all businesses in the UK.

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> regularly monitors goods that are being imported or exported under preference.</p>

<p>You must keep all relevant paperwork for up to three years. If you can’t prove the origin of any goods you have exported under preference in the past three years your customer may have to pay the full rate of duty on them. In this case, the customer may expect you to repay the duty to them.</p>

<p>If you’re found to be exporting goods under preference incorrectly you could face penalties. See customs seizures and penalties.</p>
