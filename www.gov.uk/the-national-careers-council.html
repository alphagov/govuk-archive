<p>The government’s vision for a better quality of information, advice and guidance on learning and work is set out in the document <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-careers-service-the-right-advice-at-the-right-time">The right advice at the right time</a> , published in April 2012, the month the <a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121205150610/http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/further-education-skills/national-careers-service-for-england">National Careers Service</a> was launched.</p>

The council’s secretariat is provided by the Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills (BIS).</p>

<h2 id="the-councils-work">The Council’s work</h2>

<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>

<h2 id="evidence-to-lord-heseltine-review">Evidence to Lord Heseltine Review</h2>

<p>On 30 August 2012 members of the NCC met with the Lord Heseltine review team of how spending departments and other relevant public sector bodies interact with the private sector, and to assess their capacity to deliver pro-growth policies. The meeting covered:</p>

<ul>
<li>raising the work-readiness of school leavers and those acquiring tertiary qualifications</li>
  <li>remedying skills deficiencies in the current workforce</li>
  <li>addressing the longstanding NEETs (not in education, employment or training) problem and encouraging apprenticeships and support for the lower skilled</li>
</ul>
<p>A copy of the written evidence submitted to Lord Heseltine’s Review can be found here:</p>

<p>The National Careers Council is currently auditing key policy themes and has identified seven major challenges that will inform its ongoing work. A work plan, formally presented to the minister on 2 July 2012, sets out key priorities and plans for 2012 to 2013. </p>

<p>A further update will be produced in September 2012.</p>

<h2 id="next-stage-plans">Next stage plans</h2>

<p>The next 2 Council meetings are scheduled to be held on 14 January 2013 and 18 April 2013. Dr Hughes will be meeting with interested parties to find ways of connecting organisations and individuals to feed into the Council’s work. The Council will develop a more detailed work plan for each of the three work strands and look at ways to involve others in its work.</p>
