  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer covering the cost of credit, debit or charge card payments made by your employees, you have certain National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>What you have to pay and how you report this depends on how the card is used and what the employee purchases with it.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/eim16100.htm" title="Exclusions from the scope of the non-cash voucher and credit token legislation" rel="external">Different rules apply</a>  when buying certain items with a card, eg fuel for a company car, parking spaces or incidental overnight expenses.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report or pay anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> if all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’ve authorised your employee to make the purchase </li>
  <li>your employee makes it clear during the purchase that they’re acting on behalf of your business</li>
  <li>the supplier accepts that the purchase is on behalf of your business</li>
  <li>your employee isn’t making <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/eim16100.htm" title="Exclusions from the scope of the non-cash voucher and credit token legislation">a purchase where different rules apply</a> (eg fuel for a company car, parking spaces or incidental overnight expenses)</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If card charges aren’t <a href="/expenses-benefits-credit-debit-charge-cards/whats-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you must report them to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and may have to deduct and pay National Insurance on them.</p>

<p>This depends on how the credit or debit card is used, whether it’s clearly used on the employer’s behalf and what the employee purchases with it.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>‘Used on the employer’s behalf’ means that the employee makes it clear to the supplier that they are making the purchase for your business, and the supplier accepts this.</p>
</div>

<h2>The card is used on the employer’s behalf but without permission</h2>
