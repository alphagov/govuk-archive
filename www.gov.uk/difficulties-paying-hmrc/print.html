  </header><p>You should check if there are ways you could pay your tax bill, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask anyone who owes you money to pay you more quickly</li>
  <li>stop spending money on things that aren’t essential and put the money towards paying your tax</li>
  <li>use any savings you have to pay your tax bill</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can’t pay all your tax on time, contact HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You may be able to either: </p>

<ul>
<li>get more time to pay</li>
  <li>pay your bill in instalments</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you don’t contact <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, you’ll get charged penalties and interest, making your tax bill bigger</p>

<h2>If you’ve been sent a payment demand</h2>

<h2>If you haven’t been sent a payment demand</h2>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Business Payment Support Service</strong><br>
0845 302 1435<br>
Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm<br>
Saturday and Sunday, 8am to 4pm</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Make sure you’ve got <a href="/difficulties-paying-hmrc/when-you-call-about-your-tax-bill" title="What happens when you call HMRC about problems paying your tax bill">specific details</a> to hand before you call.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="when-you-call-about-your-tax-bill"><header><h1>Part 4: When you call about your tax bill</h1>
  </header><h2>Before you call</h2>

<p>You’ll need to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>your reference number (eg 10-digit unique taxpayer reference, VAT reference number etc)</li>
  <li>the amount of the tax bill you’re finding it difficult to pay and the reasons why</li>
  <li>what you’ve done to try to get the money to pay the bill</li>
  <li>how much you can pay immediately and how long you may need to pay the rest</li>
</ul>
<h2>What happens when you call</h2>

<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) will ask you about:</p>

<ul>
<li>your income and expenditure</li>
  <li>your assets, like savings and investments </li>
  <li>what you’re doing to get your tax payments back in order</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will decide whether you should be able to pay immediately - or if you can’t, whether you will be able to get your payments back on track with more time.</p>

<h3>They think you can pay now</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will expect you to pay immediately and will ask for your debit or credit card details for payment over the phone.</p>

<p>If you can’t do this, they’ll tell you how you can pay directly from your bank account.</p>

<h3>They think you can pay with more time</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> may offer you extra time to pay if they think you genuinely can’t pay in full now but will be able to pay in the future. </p>

<p>They’ll encourage you to set up a direct debit to make payments on dates they agree with you. They may agree for you to pay in instalments.</p>

<p>If your circumstances change and you can pay your tax bill faster, you should tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> as soon as you can.</p>

<p>You’ll have to pay interest on the amount you pay late.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must keep these payments up to date and pay your other tax. If you don’t, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will normally cancel the arrangement and take legal action against you straight away.</p>
</div>

<h3>They don’t think you can get your payments up to date</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> won’t make an arrangement with you - they’ll expect you to pay your tax bill straight away. </p>

<p>If you don’t, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will start <a href="/if-you-don%E2%80%99t-pay-your-tax-bill">‘enforcement action’</a> to get the money from you.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can pay <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> in different ways, including direct debit.</p>
</div>

<p>You can get help and advice from <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payinghmrc/problems/debt-help.htm" title="Organisations providing advice on handling tax debts">a number of organisations</a> if you’re dealing with enforcement action for tax you owe.</p>

<h3>You’re asked for more information</h3>
<p>If you’ve been given time to pay before, you’ll be asked more in-depth questions. In more complex cases <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> may ask for evidence before they make a decision.</p>

<h2>Making a complaint</h2>
<p>You can’t appeal against <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s decision, but you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/complaints-appeals/how-to-complain/make-complaint.htm" title="How to complain to HMRC">make a complaint</a> if you’re unhappy about how you were treated.</p>
