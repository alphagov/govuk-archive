  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re from the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) or Switzerland, you can start a business in the UK.</p>

<h2>Business structures in the UK</h2>

<p>When you start a business in the UK you must <a href="/business-legal-structures" title="Choose a legal structure for a new business">choose a structure for your business</a>.</p>

<p>Most businesses in the UK are:</p>

<ul>
<li>sole traders</li>
  <li>limited companies</li>
  <li>partnerships</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a sole trader you need to register as ‘self-employed’ - this means that you are working for yourself, not for someone else.</p>

<p>Usually, if you carry on a business in the UK you’ll need to live in the UK. If your business is a private limited company, you’ll also need a registered office and at least 1 director in the UK. </p>


</article><article id="register-your-business-in-the-uk"><header><h1>Part 2: Register your business in the UK</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll need to register your business in the UK. </p>

<h2>Sole traders</h2>

<p>The easiest way to start a business in the UK is to become a ‘sole trader’. This means that only you own the business and you can work alone or employ other people. </p>

<p>You will need to register for ‘self-assessment’ tax, which means you (or your accountant) calculate your own tax.</p>

<p>To become a sole trader you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a <a href="/national-insurance-number" title="Get a National Insurance number">National Insurance (NI) number</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a href="/register-for-self-assessment" title="Register for self-assessment">register for self-assessment</a> with HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>trade under your own name or choose a business name</li>
</ul>
<p>Find out how to <a href="/set-up-sole-trader" title="Set up as a sole trader">set up business as a sole trader</a> in the UK.</p>

<h2>Limited companies</h2>

<p>You can set up a private limited company to run your business in the UK. You must appoint people to run the company (called ‘directors’) and register (or ‘incorporate’) it with Companies House. </p>

<p>As a director of the company, you are also an employee. This means that personal income and business income are separate when it comes to paying tax. </p>

<p>To set up a limited company you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/limited-company-formation/company-name-and-address" title="Company name and address">have a name and address for the company</a></li>
  <li><a href="/limited-company-formation/register-your-company" title="Register your company">register with Companies House</a></li>
  <li><a href="/limited-company-formation/directors-and-company-secretaries" title="Directors and company secretaries">have at least 1 director</a></li>
  <li><a href="/limited-company-formation/shareholders" title="Shareholders">have at least 1 shareholder</a></li>
  <li><a href="/limited-company-formation/articles-of-association" title="Articles of association">have articles of association (agreed rules about running the company)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/limited-company-formation/set-up-your-company-for-corporation-tax" title="Set up your company for corporation tax">set up your company for Corporation Tax</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Business partnerships</h2>

<p>In a business partnership, you’re running a business as an individual but all the partners share responsibility for the business. </p>

<p>With a <a href="/set-up-business-partnership" title="Set up a business partnership">business partnership</a> you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>register for self-assessment tax</li>
  <li>name your company according to certain rules</li>
  <li>run the business as an individual</li>
  <li>share profits between partners</li>
</ul></article><article id="registering-as-an-overseas-company"><header><h1>Part 3: Registering as an overseas company</h1>
  </header><p>If you are expanding your business to the UK and want to carry out business from an address in the UK you must <a href="/register-as-an-overseas-company" title="Register as an overseas company">register your business with Companies House</a>.</p>

</article><article id="licences"><header><h1>Part 4: Licences</h1>
  </header><p>When setting up business in the UK you may need to apply for a licence, depending on what your business is.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="/licence-finder" title="Licence finder">licence finder tool</a> to check if you may need a licence to set up your business.</p>

</article><article id="setting-up-a-bank-account"><header><h1>Part 5: Setting up a bank account</h1>
  </header><p>To set up a bank account for your business in the UK you can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>open a new account in the UK</li>
  <li>use the account you already have in your country</li>
  <li>open a UK sterling account in your country</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be cheaper to open a UK account or to set up a UK sterling account with your own bank, to avoid transaction and currency exchange fees.</p>

<p>You’ll need a UK address before opening a UK bank account.</p>

  </header><h2>National Insurance</h2>

<p>You may need to pay <a href="/national-insurance/overview" title="National Insurance">National Insurance</a> if you’re self-employed, depending on how much you earn. If you have employees you need to deduct National Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>) from their wages and pay those as well.</p>

<p>If you’re employing workers from the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) or Switzerland, and they have an A1 form, you’ll have to deduct according the the rules of their home country and not pay <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>
