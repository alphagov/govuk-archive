  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="when-you-need-it"><header><h1>Part 1: When you need it</h1>
  </header><p>You will probably need planning permission if you want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>build something new</li>
  <li>make a major change to your building - eg building an extension</li>
  <li>change the use of your building</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out if your project will need planning permission, contact your <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/planning/Local-Planning" title="Find your local planning authority">local planning authority (<abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr>).</a></p>

<h2>Applying for planning permission</h2>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://eplanning.scotland.gov.uk/WAM/" title="Apply for planning permission">apply for planning permission</a> online.</p>

<p>If your project needs planning permission and you do the work without getting it, you can be served an ‘enforcement notice’ ordering you to undo all the changes you have made. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>It’s illegal to ignore an enforcement notice, but you can <a href="/planning-permission-scotland/appeals" title="Appealling a planning permission decision">appeal</a> against it.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="when-you-dont-need-it"><header><h1>Part 2: When you don't need it</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t need to apply for planning permission for some types of building project. This is known as <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/planning/National-Planning-Policy/themes/PermittedDevelopment/" title="Permitted development">‘permitted development’.</a></p>

<p>Generally, building projects count as permitted development when the local planning authority decides that the development:</p>

<ul>
<li>is small</li>
  <li>won’t impact on the surrounding area</li>
</ul>
<p>You should check with your <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/planning/Local-Planning" title="Find your local planning authority">local planning authority</a> before starting work if you think your project might count as permitted development.</p>

</article><article id="after-you-apply"><header><h1>Part 3: After you apply</h1>
  </header><p>Your local planning authority (<abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr>) will decide whether to grant planning permission for your project based on its development plan. It will not take into account whether local people want it.</p>

<p>To decide whether a planning application fits with its development plan, an <abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr> will look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number, size, layout, siting and external appearance of buildings</li>
  <li>the infrastructure available - eg roads and water supply</li>
  <li>any landscaping needs</li>
  <li>what you want to use the development for</li>
  <li>how your development would affect the surrounding area - eg if it would create lots more traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, planning applications are decided within 2 months. For unusually large or complex applications the time limit is 4 months. If the decision takes longer, you can <a href="/planning-permission-scotland/appeals" title="Appeal a planning permission decision">appeal</a>.</p>


</article><article id="appeals"><header><h1>Part 4: Appeals</h1>
  </header><p>If your application is refused, try to come to an agreement with the local planning authority (<abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr>) by adjusting your plans.</p>

<p>If you can’t reach an agreement, you can appeal.</p>

<p>You must begin your appeal no more than 3 months from the date on your decision notice. If you’re appeal is because the <abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr> didn’t make a decision by the <a href="/planning-permission-scotland/after-you-apply" title="After you apply">deadline</a> you must begin it 3 months from when the deadline passed.</p>

<p>Appeals can take several months to be decided. </p>

<h2>What you can appeal against</h2>

<p>You can only appeal against a decision if the <abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>refuses your application </li>
  <li>grants permission, but with conditions you object to </li>
  <li>has not made a decision by the <a href="/planning-permission-scotland/after-you-apply" title="After you apply">deadline</a>
</li>
</ul>
