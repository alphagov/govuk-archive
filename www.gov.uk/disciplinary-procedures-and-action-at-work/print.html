  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer could start formal disciplinary action against you if they have concerns about your work, conduct or absence.</p>

<p>Before taking formal disciplinary action or dismissing you, your employer may try to raise the matter informally with you. However, they can go straight to their formal disciplinary or dismissal procedures.</p>

<p>Disciplinary procedures are a set way for an employer to deal with disciplinary issues. They should include a disciplinary hearing where you’re given a chance to explain your side of the story.</p>

<p>There should also be a chance to appeal any disciplinary action your employer decides to take.</p>

</article><article id="how-disciplinary-procedures-work"><header><h1>Part 2: How disciplinary procedures work</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer should put their disciplinary procedure in writing, and make it easily available to all staff.</p>

<p>It should say what performance and behaviour might lead to disciplinary action and what action your employer might take.</p>

<p>It should also include the name of someone you can speak to if you don’t agree with your employer’s disciplinary decision.</p>

<h2>Disciplinary steps</h2>

<p>Your employer’s disciplinary procedure should include the following steps:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>A letter setting out the issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A meeting to discuss the issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A disciplinary decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A chance to appeal this decision.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>
<abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr> (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) Code of Practice</h2>

<p>Your employer’s disciplinary procedures should follow the <a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=1041" title="Acas code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures (PDF, 1MB)"><abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr> code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures (PDF, 1MB).</a></p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your employer doesn’t have to follow the <abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr> code. However, if they don’t and you win an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="employment tribunal">employment tribunal</a> against them, you could get a larger payout.</p>
</div>

<p>There is more guidance about how employers should run disciplinaries in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/s/o/Acas-Guide-on-discipline-and-grievances_at_work_(April_11)-accessible-version-may-2012.pdf" title="The Acas guide to discipline and grievances at work (PDF, 1MB)"><abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr> guide to discipline and grievances at work (PDF, 1MB).</a></p>

<h2>Disciplinary procedures and employment contracts</h2>

<p>Your employer can also put their disciplinary procedures in your <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions" title="employment contract">employment contract</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If your employer does this and then doesn’t follow these procedures you could sue them for breach of contract.</p>
</div>

<h2>Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) has its own separate procedures. The nidirect website has more information on <a rel="external" href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/employment.htm/" title="solving workplace disputes in NI">solving workplace disputes in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>.</a></p>


</article><article id="disciplinary-hearings"><header><h1>Part 3: Disciplinary hearings</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer shouldn’t take any disciplinary action before meeting with you first and discussing the problem.</p>

<p>This disciplinary meeting (normally called a ‘hearing’) should be at a reasonable time and place.</p>

<p>At the hearing your employer should:</p>

<ul>
<li>explain the complaint against you</li>
  <li>go through the evidence</li>
  <li>give you a chance to tell your side of the story</li>
</ul>
<p>If you raise a significant new fact or issue at the hearing your employer might stop it and look into the issue. They should then rearrange the hearing at a later date.</p>

<h3>Taking someone with you to a disciplinary hearing</h3>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You have the right to take someone with you to a disciplinary hearing, but you must tell your employer about this first.</p>
</div>

<p>Your companion can be either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a colleague</li>
  <li>a trade union representative</li>
  <li>a trade union official</li>
</ul>
<p>If a colleague can’t go with you and you’re not in the union you can ask to bring a family member or a Citizens Advice Bureau worker. However, your employer doesn’t have to agree to this unless your employment contract says they must.</p>

<p>The companion can:</p>

<ul>
<li>present and/or sum up your case and say things to support your case</li>
  <li>speak to you during the hearing</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your companion can’t answer questions on your behalf.</p>
</div>

<p>Your companion can’t be disciplined for supporting you.</p>

<h2>Disciplinary action</h2>

<p>After the hearing your employer should write to you as soon as possible, saying what action they’re going to take, and telling you about your right to appeal.</p>

<p>The decision might be:</p>

<ul>
<li>no action</li>
  <li>written warning </li>
  <li>final warning </li>
  <li>demotion </li>
  <li><a href="/dismissal" title="dismissal">dismissal</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It might also be anything else that could resolve the problem, for example an agreement to mediate with a co-worker you’ve had personal problems with.</p>

</article><article id="disciplinary-appeals"><header><h1>Part 4: Disciplinary appeals</h1>
  </header><p>If you think disciplinary action taken against you is unfair you can appeal.</p>

<p>Write to your employer saying you’re appealing and why.</p>

<h2>Appeal hearings</h2>

<p>You should be offered another meeting to discuss your appeal. This appeal hearing should be held as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If possible it should be dealt with by someone who hasn’t already been involved with your disciplinary action.</p>

<p>An appeal hearing will be similar to your original disciplinary meeting and you’ll have the right to bring a companion.</p>

<h2>Final decision</h2>

<p>After the appeal meeting your employer should write to you with their final decision.</p>

</article><article id="suspension-from-work"><header><h1>Part 5: Suspension from work</h1>
  </header><p>When a disciplinary issue is being looked into you might be suspended from work. This doesn’t happen very often. If it does it should normally be with pay and you should be told why you’re being suspended.</p>

<h2>Employment contracts</h2>

<p>You can be suspended without pay if your <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions" title="employment contract">employment contract</a> says your employer can do this, but they must be acting reasonably.</p>

<p>If your employment contract doesn’t say your employer can do this, your employer may still be able to suspend you, but with pay. To show that it’s not a punishment the suspension will normally be on full pay.</p>

<h2>Employment rights when suspended</h2>

<p>You keep your employment rights while suspended. If you don’t get the right pay you may be able to make a claim to an employment tribunal for ‘unlawful deduction from wages’.</p>

<h2>Talking to other employees, customers and/or suppliers</h2>

<p>If you’re suspended, you might be told not to talk to other employees, customers and/or suppliers. If this means you can’t defend yourself properly at a disciplinary hearing, you could make an appeal.</p>

<p>But if you’ve been asked not to talk and you do, your employer might decide to take further disciplinary action against you.</p>
