  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>When you start a business, you must choose a business structure.</p>

<p>The structure you choose will define your legal responsibilities, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>the paperwork you must fill in to get started</li>
  <li>the taxes you’ll have to manage and pay</li>
  <li>how you can personally take the profit your business makes</li>
  <li>your personal responsibilities if your business makes a loss</li>
</ul>
<p>Most businesses in the UK are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/business-legal-structures/sole-trader" title="Sole traders">sole traders</a></li>
  <li><a href="/business-legal-structures/limited-company" title="Limited companies">limited companies</a></li>
  <li><a href="/business-legal-structures/ordinary-business-partnership" title="'Ordinary' business partnership">business partnerships</a></li>
</ul></article><article id="sole-trader"><header><h1>Part 2: Sole trader</h1>
  </header><h2>What ‘sole trader’ means</h2>

<p>If you’re a sole trader, you’re running your own business as an individual. You can keep all your business’ profits after you’ve paid tax on them.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can take on staff - ‘sole trader’ means you’re responsible for the business, not that you have to work alone.</p>
</div>

<h2>Sole traders’ legal responsibilities</h2>

<p>You’re personally responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>any losses your business makes</li>
  <li>bills for things you buy for your business, like stock or equipment</li>
  <li>keeping records of your business’ sales and spending</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to set up as sole trader</h2>

<p>You must <a rel="external" href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/registration/newbusiness" title="Register as a new business">register with HM Revenue &amp; Customs</a> (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) as soon as you can after starting your business.</p>

<p>If you register later than 5 October in your business’ second tax year, you could be charged a penalty.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
If you start up as a sole trader during tax year 2012 to 2013, you must register before 5 October 2013.</p>
</div>

<h2>Sole traders’ tax responsibilities</h2>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>send a <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Self Assessment tax return</a> every year</li>
  <li>pay <a href="/income-tax-rates" title="Income Tax rates">Income Tax</a> on the profits your business makes</li>
  <li>pay <a href="/self-employed-national-insurance-rates" title="National Insurance rates for self-employed people">National Insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also have to <a href="/vat-registration" title="VAT registration">register for VAT</a> if you expect your business’ takings to be more than £77,000 a year.</p>


</article><article id="limited-company"><header><h1>Part 3: Limited company</h1>
  </header><h2>What a limited company is</h2>

<p>A limited company is an organisation that you can set up to run your business. </p>

<p>It’s responsible in its own right for everything it does and its finances are separate to your personal finances. </p>

<p>Any profit it makes is owned by the company, after it pays <a href="/corporation-tax-rates" title="Corporation Tax rates">Corporation Tax</a>. The company can then <a href="/running-a-limited-company/taking-money-out-of-a-limited-company" title="Taking money out of a limited company">share its profits.</a></p>

<h2>Who owns limited companies</h2>

<p>Every limited company has ‘members’ - people or organisations who own shares in the company. </p>

<p>Directors are responsible for running the company. Directors often own shares, but they don’t have to.</p>

<h2>Limited companies’ legal responsibilities</h2>

<p>There are many <a href="/running-a-limited-company" title="Running a limited company">legal responsibilities</a> involved with being a director and running a limited company. </p>

<p>Most limited companies are ‘limited by shares’. </p>

<p>This means that the company’s responsibilities for financial liabilities it can’t pay are limited to the value of company shares that haven’t been paid for.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
A company limited by shares issues 1,000 shares valued at £1 each when it’s set up. Its 2 shareholders own 250 shares each. </p>

<p>If the company goes bust, the maximum it has to pay towards outstanding bills is £500 - the value of the 500 shares issued but not paid for.</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Company directors aren’t personally responsible for debts the business can’t pay if it goes wrong, as long as they haven’t broken the law.</p>
</div>

<h2>Other types of company</h2>

<p>Most companies are private companies limited by shares. There are 3 other types.</p>

<h3>Private company limited by guarantee</h3>

<p>Directors or shareholders financially back the organisation up to a specific amount if things go wrong.</p>

<h3>Private unlimited company</h3>

<p>Directors or shareholders are liable for all debts if things go wrong.</p>

<h3>Public limited company</h3>

<p>Companies where shares are traded publicly on a market, like the London Stock Exchange.</p>

<h2>How to set up a limited company</h2>

<p>You must <a href="/limited-company-formation" title="Limited company formation">set up the company with Companies House</a> and let HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) know <a href="/limited-company-formation/set-up-your-company-for-corporation-tax" title="Letting HMRC know when your limited company starts trading">when the company starts business activities.</a> </p>

<p>Every financial year, the company must:</p>

<ul>
<li>put together <a href="/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company/prepare-annual-accounts" title="prepare annual accounts">statutory accounts</a>
</li>
  <li>send Companies House an <a href="/running-a-limited-company/company-annual-return" title="Company annual return">annual return</a>

</ul></article><article id="ordinary-business-partnership"><header><h1>Part 4: 'Ordinary' business partnership</h1>
  </header><p>In a business partnership, you and your business partner (or partners) personally share responsibility for your business.</p>

<p>You can share all your business’ profits between the partners. Each partner pays tax on their share of the profits.</p>

<h2>Business partners’ legal responsibilities</h2>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
