For example, a motorcycle theory test will contain questions that don't appear in any other test.\r\n\r\nFor the hazard perception test there are no separate versions for different vehicles, but the pass mark is different for them.\r\n\r\n##At the theory test centre\r\n\r\nYou aren't allowed to take any personal items into the test room with you.
