  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you want to drive a car or ride a motorcycle you’ll need to pass the driving theory test before booking either the <a href="/practical-driving-test-for-cars" title="car practical driving test">car practical driving test</a> or the <a href="/motorcycle-practical-test" title="motorcycle practical test">motorcycle practical test</a>.</p>

<p>There are 2 parts to the theory test:</p>

<ul>
<li>the multiple choice part</li>
  <li>the hazard perception part</li>
</ul>
<p>Both parts of the test are taken on the same day. The questions in the multiple-choice part and format of the hazard perception part depend on what kind of vehicle you want to drive.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You need to pass both to pass the theory test.</p>
</div>

<h2>The theory test pass certificate</h2>

<p>You’ll then get a theory test pass certificate.  You’ll need the certificate number when you <a href="/book-practical-driving-test" title="book your practical test">book your practical test</a>.</p>

<h2>Preparing for the test</h2>

<p>There are official publications and tools to help you <a href="/driving-theory-test/preparing-for-the-theory-test" title="prepare for the test">prepare for the test</a>, and if you’ve got <a href="/driving-theory-test/if-you-have-special-needs" title="special needs">special needs</a> then there are a number of facilities to help.</p>

</article><article id="who-needs-to-take-the-test"><header><h1>Part 2: Who needs to take the test</h1>
  </header><h2>Great Britain licence holders</h2>

<p>In most cases you need to take the theory test before you can get your first full car or motorcycle driving licence.</p>

<p>However, there are 2 exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you hold a full motorcycle licence issued before 1 February 2001 you don’t need to take the car theory test</li>
  <li>if you hold a full moped licence issued before 1 July 1996 following a test <strong>and</strong> have a full car licence you don’t need to take the motorcycle theory test</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding new categories to your licence</h3>

<p>You’ll need to take another theory test if you want a licence for a new category of vehicle.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a car licence and you want a motorcycle licence you’ll need to take the motorcycle theory test before taking the motorcycle practical test.</p>

<p>If you want to upgrade within a vehicle category you won’t normally need to take a theory test. </p>

<p>For example, if you have a full automatic car licence and you want a manual car licence you won’t have to take a theory test.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>It’s your job to make sure you have the right licence. If you’re not sure if you need to take a theory test contact the Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>).</p>

</article><article id="how-the-theory-test-works"><header><h1>Part 3: How the theory test works</h1>
  </header><p>The theory test is made up of a multiple-choice part and a hazard perception part. You need to pass both parts to pass the theory test.</p>

<p>If you pass one part and fail the other you’ll fail the whole test, and you’ll need to take both parts again.</p>

<p>The questions in the multiple-choice test will depend on the category of vehicle you are hoping to get a licence for. For example, a motorcycle theory test will contain questions that don’t appear in any other test.</p>

<p>For the hazard perception test there are no separate versions for different vehicles, but the pass mark is different for them.</p>

<h2>At the theory test centre</h2>

<p>You aren’t allowed to take any personal items into the test room with you. All your personal items must be stored in the lockers provided.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you’re found with any prohibited items in the testing room your test will be stopped, you’ll be asked to leave and you’ll lose your test fee.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you’re in the test room you aren’t allowed to talk to or distract other candidates.</p>

<h2>The multiple-choice part</h2>

<p>Before the test starts you’ll be given instructions on how it works.</p>

<p>You can choose to do a practice session of multiple-choice questions to get used to the layout of the test. At the end of the practice session the real test will begin.</p>

<p>A question and several possible answers will appear on a computer screen - you have to select the correct answer. Some questions may need more than one answer.</p>

<p>You can move between questions and ‘flag’ questions that you want to come back to later in the test.</p>

<p>Some car and motorcycle questions will be given as a case study. The case study will:</p>

<ul>
<li>show a short story that 5 questions will be based on</li>
  <li>focus on real life examples and experiences you could come across when you’re driving</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The car and motorcycle multiple-choice part lasts for 57 minutes and the pass mark is 43 out of 50.</p>
</div>

<p>After the multiple-choice part you can choose to have a break of up to 3 minutes before the hazard perception part starts.</p>

<h2>The hazard perception part</h2>

<p>Before you start the hazard perception part, you’ll be shown a short video clip about how it works.</p>

<p>You’ll then be shown a series of 14 video clips on a computer screen. The clips:</p>

<ul>
<li>feature everyday road scenes</li>
  <li>contain at least one ‘developing hazard’ - but one of the clips will feature 2 ‘developing hazards’</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A developing hazard is something that may result in you having to take some action, such as changing speed or direction.</p>
</div>

<h3>Hazard perception test scoring</h3>

<p>The earlier you notice a developing hazard and make a response, the higher you will score. </p>

<p>The most you can score for each developing hazard is 5 points.</p>

<p>To get a high score you need to respond to the developing hazard as soon as you see it starting.</p>

<p>If you click continuously or in a pattern during a clip a message will appear at the end. It will tell you that you have scored zero for that particular clip.</p>

<p>You won’t be able to review your answers.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The pass mark for cars and motorcycles is 44 out of 75.</p>
</div>

<h2>Your test result</h2>

<p>You will be given the results of your theory tests at the test centre after taking it.</p>

<p>If you pass your theory test, you’ll get a pass certificate. You’ll need this when you book and take your practical test.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Your theory test pass certificate lasts for 2 years after taking your test. If you haven’t passed your practical test by then, you’ll need to take and pass the theory test again.</p>
</div>
