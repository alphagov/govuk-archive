  </header><p>If you meet the rules of the UK Pet Travel Scheme (<abbr title="Pet Travel Scheme">PETS</abbr>), you can take your pet cat, dog or ferret abroad and return to the UK without the need for quarantine.</p>

<p>Before travelling, you must take your animal to a vet so that it can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>fitted with a microchip</li>
  <li>vaccinated against rabies</li>
  <li>issued with a pet passport (if it’s travelling in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) or has a <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-pets/pets/travel/pets/pet-owners/documentation" title="third country veterinary certificate">third country veterinary certificate</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must wait 21 days from the date of the rabies vaccination before travelling.</p>
</div>

<p>Dogs must also be treated by a vet for tapeworm, not less than 24 hours and not more than 120 hours before its scheduled time of entry into the UK.</p>

  </header><p>Cats, dogs and ferrets travelling to unlisted countries must also:</p>
