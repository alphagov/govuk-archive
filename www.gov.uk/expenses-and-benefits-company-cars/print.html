    <section role="main"><header><h1>Expenses and benefits: company cars and fuel, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing company cars and fuel to your employees, you have certain National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>cars used for private journeys, or business journeys only</li>
  <li>‘pool cars’ used by more than one employee</li>
  <li>cars adapted for an employee with a disability</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You may not have to report or pay anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. To be exempt, your employees must use the car or fuel in one of the following ways.</p>

<h2>Cars available for business journeys only</h2>

<p>Business journeys are either:</p>

<ul>
<li>journeys that are part of your employees duties, eg a service engineer travelling to an appointment</li>
  <li>journeys an employee has to make to get to a temporary workplace</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>To be exempt, company cars used for business journeys must not be available for employees’ private use.</p>
</div>

<h2>Cars adapted for an employee with a disability</h2>

<p>This includes cars with automatic transmission if the employees’ disability means they need this. These cars are exempt if the only private use is for:</p>

<ul>
<li>journeys between home and work</li>
  <li>travel to work-related training</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cars or fuel for employees who earn at a rate of less than £8,500 a year</h2>

<p>You don’t have to pay or report on any cars or fuel that you provide for these employees, even if they use them for private journeys.</p>

<h2>Fuel that employees pay for</h2>

<p>You don’t have to pay or report on fuel, including for private journeys, if:</p>

<ul>
<li>employees buy the fuel for their own use</li>
  <li>you buy it and they pay you back during the tax year</li>
</ul>
<h2>‘Pool’ cars</h2>

<p>You don’t have to pay or report on pool cars – these are cars used by more than one employee for business purposes, and normally kept on your premises.</p>


</article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the cars you provide aren’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-company-cars/whats-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you must report them to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and you may have to pay National Insurance on their value.</p>

<h2>Cars for private use</h2>

<p>If your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of more than £8,500 a year, or if they’re a director, you’ll need to <a href="/report-a-company-car" title="report this to HMRC separately">report this to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> separately</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of the tax year, you’ll also need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>report on form P11D, section F</li>
  <li>pay Class 1A National Insurance on the value of the car benefit</li>
</ul>
<p>See <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/eim23000.htm" title="guidance on car and car fuel benefit">guidance on car and car fuel benefit</a> for full details of the rules and when they apply.</p>

<h2>Fuel for private use</h2>

<p>If your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of more than £8,500 a year, or if they’re a director, and they don’t pay you back during the tax year, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>report on form P11D, section F</li>
  <li>pay Class 1A National Insurance on the value of the car benefit</li>
</ul></article><article id="work-out-the-value"><header><h1>Part 4: Work out the value</h1>
  </header><p>You can <a href="/calculate-tax-on-company-cars" title="work out the value of cars and fuel">work out the value of cars and fuel</a> using <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s online tools, or commercial payroll software.</p>

<p>You can also work out the value manually on the <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?record=QD3XDgv9U1E&amp;formid=748" title="P11D working sheet 2">P11D working sheet 2.</a> You’ll have to use this method if both of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>the car was unavailable for at least 30 consecutive days during the tax year</li>
  <li>you were providing fuel for private use, but stopped doing this</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cars adapted for an employee with a disability</h2>

<p>Special rules apply when calculating the value of these cars if they’re made available for private use. This doesn’t include:</p>

<ul>
<li>journeys between home and work</li>
  <li>travel to work-related training</li>
</ul>
<p>See <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s guidance on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM23650.htm" title="car benefits for disabled drivers">car benefits for disabled drivers.</a></p>
