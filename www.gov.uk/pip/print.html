  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>From 8 April 2013, a new benefit called Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>) will replace Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>) for disabled people aged 16 to 64.</p>

<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> helps with some of the extra costs caused by ill-health or disability. It’s based on how your condition affects you, not what condition you have.</p>

<h2>What you’ll get</h2>
<p>Payments will be made up of a daily living component and a mobility component. You could get money for 1 or both parts, at either a standard or enhanced rate.</p>

<td>Enhanced</td>
      <td>£79.15</td>
      <td>£55.25</td>

<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> will <a href="/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid" title="How and when your benefits are paid">normally be paid into your account</a> every 4 weeks. </p>

<p>How much you’ll get depends on how your health condition or disability affects you.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Read about <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/disability/personal-independence-payment/" title="Personal Independence Payment" rel="external">Personal Independence Payment</a> or look at the <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/disability/personal-independence-payment/pip-faqs-and-myth-buster/" title="Personal Independence Payment - frequently asked questions and myth buster" rel="external">frequently asked questions and myth buster</a> on the Department of Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) website.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="what-you-need-to-do"><header><h1>Part 2: What you need to do</h1>
  </header><p>You <strong>don’t</strong> need to contact the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) about this now, even if you get Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>) at the moment. </p>

<h2>If you currently get <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>
</h2>
<p>Most people currently claiming <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> won’t be affected before 2015.</p>

<p>If your condition changes, or you reach the end of your existing <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> award then you may be affected earlier.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll need to apply for <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> even if you get an indefinite or lifetime award of <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll get a letter early in 2013 to tell you:</p>

<ul>
<li>more about <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>when you might be affected</li>
</ul>
<p>If you apply for <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>, your <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> will continue until <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> makes a decision about your claim. If you decide not to apply, your <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> will end.</p>

<h3>Turning 16 or 65</h3>
<p>The change from <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> only affects people aged 16 to 64.</p>

<p>If you receive <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> and you’ll reach 65 after 8 April 2013, you won’t be contacted until 2015 at the earliest, unless the effect of your health condition or disability changes before then.</p>

<p>Children who get <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> and who will turn 16 on or after 7 October 2013 will need to decide if they want to claim <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>. If this affects your child, you’ll get a letter letting you know when and how to apply.</p>

<h2>New claims</h2>
<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> will be introduced for new claims in parts of the north of England from 8 April 2013, and nationwide from June 2013.</p>

<p>You’ll have to phone <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to make a new claim. They’ll then send you a form asking you to describe how your long-term health condition or disability affects you.</p>

<p>Most people will be asked to attend a face-to-face consultation with a health professional as part of the claim. </p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will decide whether you’re entitled to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> and how much you should get, based on the advice of the health professional and any other evidence you supply.</p>

<p>Your claim will be reviewed regularly to make sure you’re getting the right support.</p>
