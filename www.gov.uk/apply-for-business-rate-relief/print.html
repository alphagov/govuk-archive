</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you pay business rates, your property may be eligible for business rates relief. </p>

<p>Business rates are taxes to help pay for local services. They’re charged on most non-domestic properties. </p>

<p>Your local council will automatically apply some reliefs. </p>

<p>You have to apply for the following reliefs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="small-business-rate-relief" title="small business rate relief">small business rate relief</a></li>
  <li><a href="rural-rate-relief" title="rural rate relief">rural rate relief</a></li>

  <li><a href="charitable-rate-relief" title="charitable rate relief">charitable rate relief</a></li>
  <li><a href="enterprise-zones" title="enterprise zone relief">enterprise zone relief</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some local councils provide an additional hardship relief if your business meets certain criteria. Contact your <a href="/contact-your-local-council-about-your-business-rates" title="Contact your local council about your business rates">local council</a> to find out more. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Contact your <a href="/contact-your-local-council-about-your-business-rates" title="Contact your local council about your business rates">local council</a> if you’re not getting any reliefs you think you’re entitled to.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="small-business-rate-relief"><header><h1>Part 2: Small business rate relief</h1>
  </header><p>You can get small business rate relief if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you only use one property</li>
  <li>its <a href="/introduction-to-business-rates/how-your-rates-are-calculated" title="How business rates are calculated">rateable value</a> is less than £12,000</li>
</ul>
<h2>What you get</h2>
<p>Until 31 March 2013 you’ll get 100% relief (doubled from the usual rate of 50%) for properties with a rateable value of £6,000 or less. This means you won’t pay business rates on properties with a rateable value of £6,000 or less. </p>

<p>The rate of relief will gradually decrease from 100% to 0% for properties with a rateable value between £6,001 and £12,000. </p>

<h2>You have more than one property</h2>
<p>You could get small business rate relief if the rateable value of each of your other properties is less than £2,600. </p>

<p>The rateable values of the properties are added together and the relief applied to the main property. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Contact your  <a href="/contact-your-local-council-about-your-business-rates" title="Contact your local council about your business rates">local council</a> to apply for small business rate relief.</p>
</div>

<h2>You’re a small business but don’t qualify for relief</h2>
<p>If your property has a rateable value below £18,000 (£25,500 in Greater London) you’re considered a small business. </p>

<p>Even if you don’t qualify for small business rate relief, your business rates will be calculated using the small business multiplier instead of the standard one. This is the case even if you have multiple properties. </p>

<p>The multiplier shows the percentage (pence in the pound) of the rateable value that you pay in business rates. A <a rel="external" href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/rli/static/helppages/english/faqs/faq146-what_are_the_current_multipliers.html" title="list of current business rates multipliers">list of current multipliers</a> is on the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) website.</p>


</article><article id="transitional-rate-relief"><header><h1>Part 3: Transitional rate relief</h1>
  </header><p>If the rateable value of your property changes significantly as a result of revaluation, your rates will change gradually. This is called ‘transitional relief’. </p>

<p>If you get transitional relief, your local council will include this automatically when working out what business rates you should pay.</p>

<p>A small property is a property with a 2010 rateable value below £18,000 (£25,500 within Greater London). All other properties are large properties.</p>

<p>There are limits on how much your rates can increase or decrease.</p>

</table></article><article id="rural-rate-relief"><header><h1>Part 4: Rural rate relief</h1>
  </header><p>If your business is in a rural area with a population below 3,000 you could get rural rate relief. You get between 50% and 100% off your business rates.</p>

<p>You can get relief if your business is:</p>

<ul>
<li>the only village shop or post office with a <a href="/introduction-to-business-rates/how-your-rates-are-calculated" title="How your rates are calculated">rateable value</a> of up to £8,500  </li>
  <li>the only public house or petrol station with a <a href="/introduction-to-business-rates/how-your-rates-are-calculated" title="How your rates are calculated">rateable value</a> of up to £12,500  </li>
</ul>
<p>Local councils can also:  </p>

<ul>
<li>top up the mandatory 50% relief to 100%  </li>
  <li>give relief to other rural retail businesses of up to 100% (for properties with a rateable value under £16,500)  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/contact-your-local-council-about-your-business-rates" title="Contact your local council about your business rates">Contact your local council</a> to see if you can get additional rate reliefs.</p>

</article><article id="deferral-scheme"><header><h1>Part 5: Deferral scheme</h1>
  </header><p>This lets you spread the Retail Price Index increase of your 2012 business rates bill over 3 years.  </p>

<p>This is 3.2% of your 2012 to 2013 bill, which you can choose to pay over the next 2 financial years (half in each year).  </p>

<p>You have to pay your full business rates for those years.</p>

<h2>When to apply</h2>
<p>You can apply until 31 March 2013 as long as you still have some of your bill left to pay. You can defer 3.2% of the whole year’s 2012 to 2013 bill regardless of when you apply.   </p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>
<p>If you have more than one property in the same council area you only have to <a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/bril32012" title="apply for the deferral scheme">send one form</a> to your local council. </p>

<p>If you have properties in different council areas, you’ll have to send a form to each council.</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you leave a property you must pay all the business rates you still owe, including the amount you’ve deferred.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re behind in paying your business rates, your local council might not let you use this scheme.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="charitable-rate-relief"><header><h1>Part 6: Charitable rate relief</h1>
  </header><p>Charities and amateur community sports clubs can apply for relief of up to 80% if a property is used for charitable purposes.  </p>

<p>Check with your <a href="/contact-your-local-council-about-your-business-rates" title="Contact your council about your business rates">local council</a> to see if you are eligible. </p>

<p>You should also check if you can get additional ‘discretionary relief’ (up to 100%). This is sometimes provided by local councils to ‘top up’ certain reliefs to give businesses and charities extra help. </p>

</article><article id="enterprise-zones"><header><h1>Part 7: Enterprise zones</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re starting up or relocating to an enterprise zone, you’ll qualify for enterprise zone relief. You must start up or relocate by April 2015.</p>
