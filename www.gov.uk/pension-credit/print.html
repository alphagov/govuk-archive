</div>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>

</li>
  <li>your weekly income is less than £142.70 (single people) or £217.90 (couples)</li>

  <li>some of your income can be ignored (certain <a href="/pension-credit/further-information" title="Further information">benefits and payments don’t count</a>)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>You could get up to:</p>

<ul>
<li>£18.54 a week if you are single</li>

<h2>Self-assessment taxpayers</h2>
<p>You must tell The Pension Service how much Income Tax you expect to pay for the current tax year - this affects how much Pension Credit you’ll get.</p>
