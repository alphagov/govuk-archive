</header><article id="increase-your-retirement-income"><header><h1>Part 1: Increase your retirement income</h1>
  </header><p>There are a number of things you can do to make sure you have enough money in retirement.</p>

<h2>Join a workplace pension</h2>

<p>If your employer offers a pension scheme, it may be worth joining it. Your contributions will increase in value by the time you retire and you don’t pay tax on the money that goes into it.</p>

<h3>Automatic enrolment</h3>

<p>If you’re not a member of a scheme and you haven’t specifically chosen not to join one, you may get <a href="/auto-enrolment-workplace-company-pension" title="Automatic enrolment into a pension at work">automatically enrolled</a> into a scheme.</p>

<h2>Make extra workplace pension contributions</h2>

<p>You can pay extra into your workplace pension scheme, if you’re a member of one. Contact the pension scheme to find out how, or ask your employer.</p>

<h2>Make extra National Insurance contributions</h2>

<p>If you want to increase the amount of State Pension you’ll get, you can make extra <a href="/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions" title="Voluntary National Insurance contributions">voluntary National Insurance contributions</a>.</p>

<h2>Find a lost pension</h2>

<p>If you have any old pensions and you think the company might not be able to contact you, you can <a href="/find-lost-pension" title="Find a lost pension">find a lost pension</a>.</p>

<h2>Work longer</h2>

<p>You <a href="/retirement-age" title="Retirement age">don’t have to retire</a> at a particular age, unless there’s a good reason that the employer can justify.</p>

<h2>Defer your State Pension</h2>

<p>You can choose not to claim your State Pension when you reach State Pension age but take it later (‘<a href="/deferring-state-pension" title="Deferring your State Pension">deferring your State Pension</a>’). This means you’ll either get a lump sum or an increased weekly amount when you do claim it.</p>

<h2>Pay into a personal pension</h2>

<p>This is a voluntary scheme you pay into to save for retirement, but it also allows you to pay less tax. They’re often used by self-employed people instead of a workplace pension.</p>

<p>For help and advice with personal pensions, contact the <a rel="external" href="http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/" title="Pensions Advisory Service">Pensions Advisory Service.</a></p>

<h2>Other ways to save</h2>

<p>There are also other ways to save including savings accounts and Individual Savings Accounts (‘<abbr title="Individual Savings Accounts">ISAs</abbr>’). </p>
