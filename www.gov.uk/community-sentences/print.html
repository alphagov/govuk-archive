  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You may get a community sentence if you’re convicted of a crime by a court but are not sent to prison.</p>

<p>You may have to do unpaid work in your local community, like removing graffiti. This is called Community Payback.</p>

<p>Community sentences can be given for crimes such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>damaging property</li>
  <li>benefit fraud </li>
  <li>assault  </li>
</ul>
<p>You may get a community sentence if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the court thinks you’re more likely to stop committing crime than if you go to prison </li>
  <li>it’s the first time you have committed a crime </li>
  <li>you have a mental health condition that affects your behaviour</li>
</ul></article><article id="community-payback"><header><h1>Part 2: Community Payback</h1>
  </header><p>Community Payback is unpaid work like:</p>

<ul>
<li>removing graffiti </li>
  <li>clearing wasteland </li>
  <li>decorating public places and buildings - for example, a community centre</li>
</ul>
<p>You will usually work in your local area, and be managed by a Community Payback supervisor. You must wear a high visibility orange vest while you work.</p>

<p>You can expect to complete anything from 40 to 300 hours of Community Payback, depending on how serious your crime was.</p>

<p>If you’re unemployed you have to work 3 or 4 days each week.</p>

<p>If you have a job, the Community Payback work will be arranged outside your working hours, like evenings or weekends.</p>

</article><article id="treatment-and-programmes"><header><h1>Part 3: Treatment and programmes</h1>
  </header><p>The treatment or programmes you get are intended to help with problems that led you to commit crime in the first place. They’re also to stop you committing more crime.</p>

<p>Programmes and treatment could be to help with:</p>

<ul>
<li>any addictions you have - like drugs </li>
  <li>a mental health condition </li>
  <li>getting new skills and qualifications  </li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the treatment or programme, it could involve:</p>

<ul>
<li>counselling sessions - where you get support from a medical professional</li>
  <li>drug testing</li>
  <li>‘accredited programmes’, such as anger management courses, to help with your behaviour</li>
  <li>mental health treatment with a doctor or psychologist</li>
  <li>improving your reading and writing </li>
  <li>getting help with a job application </li>
  <li>learning interview skills</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t complete a treatment or programme, or fail a drugs test, you could be sent back to court and your punishment could increase.</p>

</article><article id="what-you-can-and-cant-do-while-on-a-community-sentence"><header><h1>Part 4: What you can and can’t do while on a community sentence</h1>
  </header><p>What you can and can’t do while on a community sentence is decided by:</p>

<ul>
<li>a court when you are sentenced </li>
  <li>the person dealing with your sentence once it’s started - called the ‘offender manager’ </li>
</ul>
<p>This can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>being at a particular place at certain times - known as a ‘curfew’ </li>
  <li>wearing an electronic tag to check that you stay there</li>
  <li>appointments with an offender manager </li>
  <li>being stopped from going to certain places or areas, eg your victim’s home</li>
  <li>being stopped from taking part in certain activities, eg going to a pub or a bar</li>
  <li>being told where you have to live, eg a family member’s home</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t stick to the rules while you’re on a community sentence, you could get a warning or be sent back to court, and your punishment could increase. </p>

</article><article id="community-sentences-if-you-are-under-18"><header><h1>Part 5: Community sentences if you are under 18</h1>
  </header><p>Community sentences for young people are different from those given to adults.</p>

<p>There are 3 main community sentences a court can give you:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>referral orders</strong> – when, with a panel of people from your local community and your youth justice workers, you are asked to agree a programme of work to address your behaviour</li>
  <li>
<strong>reparation orders</strong> – when you make up for the harm caused by your crime, like repairing any damage to the victim’s property</li>
  <li>
<strong>Youth Rehabilitation Order</strong> – when a court decides on different things that you have to do or must not do, which can last for up to 3 years</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also be given a discharge, when the court decides that the experience of being arrested and going to court is enough of a punishment.</p>

<p>As part of your community sentence you may also have to speak to the victim and:</p>

<ul>
<li>listen to their side of the story</li>
  <li>apologise to them, either in writing or, if the victim wants, face-to-face</li>
</ul>
<p>If you break the rules of your community sentence you could end up back in court, and if you have recently been released from custody you could be sent back.</p>
