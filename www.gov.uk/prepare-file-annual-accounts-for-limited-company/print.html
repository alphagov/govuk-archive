<p>These deadlines are for private limited companies.</p>
</div>

<h2>New and dormant companies</h2>

<p>You must take additional steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>at the end of <a href="/first-company-accounts-and-return" title="Your limited company's first annual accounts and Company Tax Return">your company’s first year</a>
</li>
  <li>if you <a href="/restart-a-non-trading-or-dormant-company" title="Restart a dormant company">restart a dormant company</a>
</li>
</ul></article><article id="prepare-annual-accounts"><header><h1>Part 2: Prepare annual accounts</h1>
  </header><p>After the end of your company’s financial year, you must prepare annual accounts - called ‘statutory accounts’ - from the company’s <a href="/running-a-limited-company/company-and-accounting-records" title="Keeping records">financial records</a>.</p>

<p>You must always send copies of the statutory accounts to:</p>

<ul>
<li>all shareholders</li>
  <li>people who can go to the company’s general meetings</li>
  <li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) as part of your Company Tax Return</li>
  <li>Companies House (unless you send ‘abbreviated’ accounts - see below)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to put together your company’s statutory accounts</h2>

<p>Statutory accounts must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a ‘balance sheet’, which shows the value of everything the company owns and is owed on the last day of the financial year</li>
  <li>a ‘profit and loss account’, which shows the company’s sales, running costs and the profit or loss it has made over the financial year</li>
  <li>notes about the accounts</li>
  <li>a director’s report </li>
  <li>an auditor’s report</li>
</ul>
<p>A director must sign the balance sheet and their name must be printed on it.</p>

<h3>Accounting standards</h3>

<p>Your statutory accounts must meet either:</p>

<ul>
<li>International Financial Reporting Standards</li>
  <li>UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice</li>
</ul>
<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Codes-Standards/Accounting-and-Reporting-Policy/FRSSE.aspx" title="Download 'Financial Reporting Standards for Small Enterprises' (PDF, 594KB)" rel="external">Download ‘Financial Reporting Standards for Small Enterprises’ (PDF, 594KB)</a></p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can use accountants or tax advisers to make sure your accounts meet the standards.</p>
</div>

<h2>Small companies, audit exemption and abbreviated accounts</h2>

<p>Your company will be ‘small’ if it meets 2 of the conditions below: </p>

<ul>
<li>its turnover is less than £6.5 million</li>
  <li>it has less than £3.26 million on its balance sheet</li>
  <li>it has fewer than 50 employees </li>
</ul>
<p>If your company meets the legal requirements for ‘small’ companies, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>send shorter (‘abbreviated’) accounts to Companies House created from the statutory accounts - this means less information about your company will be publicly available</li>
  <li>use the exemption so your company’s accounts <a href="/audit-exemptions-for-private-limited-companies" title="Audit exemption for private limited companies">don’t need to be audited</a>
</li>
  <li>choose not to file a copy of the director’s report</li>
</ul>
<h3>Abbreviated accounts</h3>

<p>Abbreviated accounts are the balance sheet from the company’s statutory accounts.</p>

<p>The balance sheet must be signed by a director and their name must be printed on it.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must still send full ‘statutory’ accounts to shareholders and to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> with your Company Tax Return.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="prepare-a-company-tax-return"><header><h1>Part 3: Prepare a Company Tax Return</h1>
  </header><p>You must send a Company Tax Return online to tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) how much Corporation Tax your company needs to pay on its profits. </p>

<p>The Company Tax Return includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>form CT600 </li>
  <li>Corporation Tax calculations (and supporting documents if you’re asked for them)</li>
  <li>your <a href="/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company/prepare-annual-accounts" title="Preparing annual accounts">company’s statutory accounts</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information you’ll need</h2>

<p>You’ll need to give details including:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/pimmanual/PIM3010.htm" title="Capital allowances on qualifying plant and machinery">capital allowances</a> you want to claim for business assets you’ve bought</li>

</div>

<h2>If you made a loss</h2>

<p>A loss will reduce your Corporation Tax bill. </p>

<p>But if you’ve made losses that you can’t claim back in one tax return because they’re too large, you can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>claim the loss against your previous year’s profit - you may get a repayment of Corporation Tax if you do this</li>
  <li>claim the loss in future financial years (if your company carries on the same type of trade)</li>
</ul>
<p>To claim the loss against your previous year’s profit either:</p>

<ul>
<li>fill in the appropriate box on your Company Tax Return </li>
  <li>write to your <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/locator/locator.jsp?type=0" title="Find your Corporation Tax office"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Corporation Tax office</a> up to 2 years after the end of the financial year when you made the loss</li>
</ul>
<h3>Repayments</h3>

<p>You tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> how to make repayments when you complete your Company Tax Return.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You might not get a repayment if your company owes <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> for other taxes.</p>
</div>

<h3>More than 6 months late</h3>

<p>If your Company Tax Return is 6 months late, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will write telling you how much Corporation Tax they think you must pay. This is called a ‘tax determination’. You can’t appeal against it.</p>

<p>You must pay the Corporation Tax due and send your Company Tax Return. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will recalculate the interest and penalties you need to pay.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>You can appeal to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> against a late filing penalty if you have a <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/online/excuse-missed-deadline.htm" title="Reasonable excuse for filing an online return late">‘reasonable excuse’</a></p>

<p>If you have a ‘reasonable excuse’, you can appeal against a penalty by writing to your company’s <a rel="external" href="http://search3.openobjects.com/kbroker/hmrc/locator/locator.jsp?type=0" title="Corporation Tax offices">Corporation Tax office.</a> </p>
