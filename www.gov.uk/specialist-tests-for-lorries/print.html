  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Most commercial vehicles must be tested every year to make sure that they are roadworthy and follow regulations. This is known as the <a href="/annual-test-for-lorries-buses-and-trailers" title="The annual test for lorries, buses and trailers">annual test</a>.</p>

<p>As well as the annual test, your HGV must be tested if you want to be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>carry explosives or dangerous goods in bulk - this is known as the <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>take goods vehicles outside the EU - this is known as the <abbr title="Transports Internationaux Routiers">TIR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>‘uprate’ or ‘downrate’ your vehicle to change the weight it’s allowed to carry</li>
  <li>qualify for a Reduced Pollution Certificate (<abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr>) or Low Emissions Certificate (<abbr title="Low Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr>)</li>
</ul></article><article id="the-adr-test"><header><h1>Part 2: The ADR test</h1>
  </header><p>The <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> is a specialist test for vehicles carrying dangerous or hazardous goods in bulk by road.</p>

<p>Your vehicle must pass an <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> test if it’s a commercial vehicle or trailer used to carry explosives, or if it’s used in the UK or abroad:</p>

<ul>
<li>to carry dangerous goods in bulk in a fixed tank or fixed battery of pressure vessels of over 1,000 litres capacity</li>
  <li>for carrying dangerous goods in bulk in a container or demountable tank or battery of pressure vessels of over 3,000 litres capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>The test varies depending on the type of goods you want to carry.</p>

<h2>How to book a test and what it costs</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Fill in and send application for an <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say on the form if the vehicle is to be tested while still carrying dangerous goods (or their residue) – <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> will make arrangements for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include copies of insurance certificates (originals will need to be seen at the test) for fixed tanks, batteries and pressure vessels.</p>
</li>

<p>Vehicles and trailers need individual certification. So an articulated or drawbar combination will need 2 <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> applications, 1 for the vehicle and 1 for the trailer. You have to pay a fee for each part.</p>

<h2>Fees for <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> testing and certification</h2>

<p>The fees listed are in addition to the standard annual test fee.</p>

<h2>Taking your vehicle to the test</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Vehicles shouldn’t normally be loaded or uncleaned when they’re taken for the <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> test, unless special arrangements have been made with the testing station.</p>
</div>

<p>The exception is for vehicles loaded with UN1202 diesel, gas or heating oil where there’s also no residue of other flammable materials in tank vapour spaces.</p>

<p>If a dangerous goods vehicle is taken to the test uncleaned or purged, or is laden with dangerous goods, <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> will need to see evidence that the vehicle is accompanied by a person with an appropriate <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> driver’s licence. </p>

<p>You’ll need to submit form VTG15 to the testing station to show if your vehicle is carrying or has been carrying dangerous goods.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/Transport_files/066948_Certificate_For_Carriage_of_Dangerous_Goods.pdf" title="Download 'Form VTG15: Certificate for vehicles which carry dangerous goods or hazardous substances' (PDF, 102KB)" rel="external">Download ‘Form VTG15: Certificate for vehicles which carry dangerous goods or hazardous substances’ (PDF, 102KB)</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Getting a re-inspection after a failed test</h2>
<p>If you fail the test, phone the testing station you used to arrange another inspection.</p>

<h2>New goods vehicle tractor units that have ‘<abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr>-type approval’</h2>

<p>If you buy a new tractor unit, ask your vehicle supplier if it has been built to an ‘<abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr>-type approval’. This mean you can get <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr>-type certification for it. The manufacturer should supply a combined Declaration of Conformity, and application form <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> IIIA, that you can then send to <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Duplicate <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> certificates</h2>

<p>You can get a duplicate certificate as long as the <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> certificate is still current. You can’t get a duplicate of an expired certificate.</p>

<p>Write to <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> Section with the following details:</p>

<ul>
<li>vehicle/trailer ID</li>
  <li>operator name and address</li>
  <li>reason for request (eg you’ve lost the certificate or there’s been a change of owner/operator)</li>
  <li>payment details</li>

<h3>Change of <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> category</h3>

<p>If you want a new certificate because there’s been a change of <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> category you’ll need to call the <abbr title="Accord European relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route">ADR</abbr> Section on <strong>01792 454 986/250</strong> for advice.</p>


</article><article id="the-tir-test"><header><h1>Part 3: The TIR test</h1>
  </header><p>The <abbr title="Transports Internationaux Routiers">TIR</abbr> system allows UK customs officials to pack and seal goods before they are transported outside the EU. This means that the load won’t need to be opened and inspected by customs officials at border crossings.</p>

<p>To meet the <abbr title="Transports Internationaux Routiers">TIR</abbr> requirements your vehicle must pass a test to make sure that:</p>

<ul>
<li>nothing can be put into or taken from the vehicle without it being obvious</li>
  <li>the goods compartment is built so that it has to be accessed from both inside and outside to be removed and replaced</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more details about the technical requirements in the Economic Commission for Europe’s <abbr title="Transports Internationaux Routiers">TIR</abbr> Handbook.</p>

  </header><p>You can apply to increase the maximum permitted weight your lorry can carry. </p>

<p>If no physical changes have been made to the design this is known as ‘up-plating’, or ‘uprating’ if the design <strong>has</strong> been modified. You’ll get a new plate to show the change in permitted weight.</p>

<p>After up-plating or uprating, you’ll have to pay a higher rate of vehicle tax if it means you replate to a higher vehicle tax band.</p>

<h2>Downplating and downrating</h2>

<p>You can also <a href="/vehicle-weights-explained" title="Vehicle weights explained">‘downplate’</a> or ‘downrate’ your lorry. This reduces the maximum weight it can work at and will lower its rate of vehicle tax.</p>

<p>Your vehicle will be inspected by <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> if it has been uprated or downrated before it is issued with new plates at the new weights. </p>

<p>Up-plated and downplated lorries are not usually inspected, although downplated vehicles might have to pass an official weight test before <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> issues a new plate.</p>

<h2>Apply to replate your lorry</h2>

<p>Fill in form VTG10 and send it with payment for £28 to the address on the form or your nearest <a rel="external" href="http://www.transportoffice.gov.uk/crt/doitonline/bl/vosateststationlocations/vosateststationlocations.htm" title="VOSA testing station locations"><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> goods vehicle testing station.</a></p>

  </header><p>If you modify a vehicle to cut its emissions, you can get it tested by <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> for a Reduced Pollution Certificate (<abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr>). </p>

<p>An <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> reduces the cost of your <a href="/vehicle-tax-rate-tables">vehicle tax</a> and may mean that you can drive in London’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/lez/default.aspx" title="TfL: Low Emissions Zone (LEZ)">Low Emission Zone (<abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr>)</a> without charge.</p>

<p>If your vehicle isn’t eligible for an <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> test you may be able to take a Low Emissions Certificate (<abbr title="Low Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr>) test. This means you can drive in an <abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr> but won’t qualify for reduced vehicle tax.</p>

<p>You can have the test done as part of your annual test, or separately. It’s cheaper as part of the annual test.</p>

<h2>RPCs</h2>

<p>A trade or business <abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles">HGV</abbr> over 3,500kg is eligible for the <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> test if it’s:</p>

<ul>
<li>fitted with an engine of a ‘higher environmental standard (certified as Euro IV or above that’s <abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr> compliant)</li>
  <li>converted to run on gas (vehicles modified to a gas engine with spark ignition are <abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr> compliant)</li>
  <li>fitted with an Environmentally Enhanced Vehicle (EEV) engine (Euro V and registered in the UK before 1 October 2009)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trade or business <abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles">HGV</abbr> over 3,500kg fitted with an approved Euro VI engine can also get a <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> certificate but don’t need to go for a test.

<h2>LECs</h2>

<p>If your vehicle isn’t eligible for an <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> you can take an <abbr title="Low Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr> test if your vehicle was registered in the UK before 1 October 2006 and is fitted with a full filter to <a rel="external" href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/lez/17700.aspx#tkt-tab-panel-3" title="TFL: Check your vehicle"><abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr> emissions standards.</a></p>

<p>Contact <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> if you want to get a <abbr title="Low Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr> for a vehicle that has been ‘re-engined’ to meet <abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr> emissions standards. <a href="/contact-the-dvla" title="Contact DVLA">Contact DVLA</a> if its fitted or converted to run solely on petrol or has had an approved gas conversion.</p>

<h2>What happens at the test</h2>

<p>The tests for both the <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> and the <abbr title="Low Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr> are in 2 parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>physical inspection to check any modifications, such as a filter fitted to the exhaust</li>
  <li>smoke opacity test to check emissions</li>
</ul>
<p>If your vehicle passes, you’ll be issued with a certificate. Details will be passed on to <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> automatically. It will take about 3 days for your details to be updated so you can drive in the <abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr>.</p>
