  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>The Independent Living Fund (<abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr>) provides money to help disabled people live an independent life in the community rather than in residential care.</p>

<p>You can use payments from the <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
<li>employ a carer or personal assistant to give you personal and domestic care</li>
  <li>pay a care agency to provide personal care and help with domestic duties</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re already getting help from the <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr>, your payments will continue to be reviewed to check if your circumstances are still the same.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> is permanently closed to new applications.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>The amount you get is based on how much care you need and how much it will cost.</p>

<p>How much of your own money you’re expected to pay towards your care is taken into account. This is called your ‘available income’.</p>

<h2>Maximum amount you can receive</h2>

<p>If you applied before April 1993, the maximum payment is £815 a week.</p>

<p>If you applied after April 1993, the maximum payment is £475 a week.</p>

<h2>How Independent Living Fund (<abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr>) payments are paid</h2>

<p><abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> payments are paid directly into your account, eg bank or building society account.</p>

<p>Payments are made every 4 weeks, usually on a Monday. Each payment you get covers the 4 weeks that have just gone. </p>

<p>When your award is reviewed, the <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> checks the records you’ll have been asked to keep showing how you spent the money. For this reason, many people find it helpful to have a separate account for their <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> money.</p>

</article><article id="further-information"><header><h1>Part 5: Further information</h1>
  </header><h2>Spending your Independent Living Fund (<abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr>) money</h2>

<p>You can use your <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> money to pay for support and services. You can use a care agency or employ your own personal assistant (<abbr title="personal assistant">PA</abbr>) for tasks including:</p>

<ul>
<li>toileting, bathing, washing and dressing</li>
  <li>eating and drinking</li>
  <li>cooking and shopping</li>
  <li>laundry, cleaning and other household tasks</li>
  <li>physical movement, eg walking and getting about</li>
</ul>
<p>If you employ your own carer or <abbr title="personal assistant">PA</abbr> the <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> can also pay:</p>

<ul>
<li>National Insurance contributions</li>
  <li>holiday pay</li>
  <li>liability insurance</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> will also consider paying for things like the costs of advertising for a <abbr title="personal assistant">PA</abbr> and health and safety training for your <abbr title="personal assistant">PA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>What you can’t use the money for</h3>

<p>You can’t use the money to pay for:</p>

<ul>
<li>any care you get from a relative who lives with you</li>
  <li>any care provided by social services</li>
  <li>maintaining your home or adapting your home</li>
  <li>gardening</li>
  <li>bills</li>
  <li>private hospitals, residential care or holidays</li>
  <li>petrol, taxi fares and travel expenses</li>
  <li>childcare</li>
</ul>
<h2>On-going support and reviews of <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> payments</h2>

<p>An independent assessor will visit you every 2 years to make sure you’re still getting the right level of payments and you’re keeping the right records.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> will write to you when you are due for a visit to tell you which assessor will contact you and explain what will happen. Your social worker (if you have one) will need to be there when the assessor visits.</p>

<p>They will check that you’re getting the right amount of care and look at the records you’ve been keeping. They will also ask you about the care you pay for, the money you have and the benefits you get.</p>

<h2>If your care costs change</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> will not normally be able to meet increases in the amount of care you need. When reviewing your <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> payments, the assessor will consider if the amount of money you currently receive is sufficient.</p>

<p>If your care arrangements change and you need more money to pay for your care, contact your <a href="/apply-needs-assessment-social-services" title="Apply for a needs assessment by social services">local authority</a> and ask them to reassess your care needs. They may be able to offer you extra help.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> will consider giving you more money if you need to pay for employer costs. Examples of these include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks</li>
  <li>health and safety training</li>
  <li>National Insurance contributions</li>
  <li>Statutory Sick Pay</li>
  <li>Advertising for a <abbr title="personal assistant">PA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you’re unhappy about a decision</h2>

<p>If you’re unhappy about a decision, you can contact the <abbr title="Independent Living Fund">ILF</abbr> and ask them to look at it again. This is called a ‘decision review’. If you’re unhappy with the service you receive you can make a complaint. If you’re still not happy you can appeal.</p>
