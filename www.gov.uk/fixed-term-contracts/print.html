  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="what-counts-as-a-fixedterm-contract"><header><h1>Part 1: What counts as a fixed-term contract</h1>
  </header><p>Employees are on a fixed-term contract if both of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>they have an employment contract with the organisation they work for</li>
  <li>their contract ends on a particular date, or on completion of a specific task, eg a project</li>
</ul>
<p>Workers don’t count as fixed-term employees if:</p>

<ul>
<li>they have a contract with an agency rather than the company they’re working for</li>
  <li>they’re a student or trainee on a work-experience placement</li>
  <li>they’re working under a ‘contract of <a href="/apprenticeships-guide/taking-on-an-apprentice" title="Taking on an apprentice">apprenticeship</a>’</li>
  <li>they’re a member of the armed forces  </li>
</ul>
<p>They may be a fixed-term employee if they’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>a seasonal or casual employee taken on for up to 6 months during a peak period</li>
  <li>a specialist employee for a project</li>
  <li>covering for maternity leave</li>
</ul></article><article id="employees-rights"><header><h1>Part 2: Employees' rights</h1>
  </header><p>Employers must not treat workers on a fixed-term contract less favourably than permanent employees doing the same or largely the same job, unless the employer can show that there is a good business reason to do so.</p>

<p>This is known as ‘objective justification’.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>
Sam is a fixed-term employee on a 3-month contract. A permanent employee doing the same kind of job has a company car, but Sam’s employer may choose to not offer him one for such a short period if the cost is too high.</p>
</div>

<p>Employers must also ensure that fixed-term employees get:</p>

<ul>
<li>the same pay and conditions as permanent staff</li>
  <li>the same or equivalent benefits package</li>
  <li>information about permanent vacancies in the organisation</li>
  <li>protection against redundancy or <a href="/dismissal" title="Dismissals">dismissal</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>However, they’re only entitled to the same rights as permanent staff working for the same employer, and not an associated employer’s organisation.</p>

<p>Anyone who’s worked continually for the same employer for 2 years or more has the same <a href="/redundant-your-rights" title="Redundancy">redundancy rights</a> as a permanent employee.</p>

<h2>Workplace disputes</h2>
<p>Workers on fixed-term contracts should try to sort out any concerns they have with their manager.</p>

<p>If they’re still not satisfied, they can ask their employer for a written statement explaining their treatment, or complain using the employer’s <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute" title="Solve a workplace dispute">grievance procedure</a>.</p>

<p>Their final option is to make a claim to an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment tribunal">employment tribunal</a>.</p>

</article><article id="renewing-or-ending-a-fixedterm-contract"><header><h1>Part 3: Renewing or ending a fixed-term contract</h1>
  </header><h2>Ending a fixed-term contact</h2>
<p>Fixed-term contracts will normally end automatically when they reach the agreed end date. The employer doesn’t have to give any notice.</p>

<h2>If a contract isn’t renewed</h2>

<p>This is considered to be a dismissal, and the employer needs to show that there’s a ‘fair’ reason for not renewing the contract (eg, if they were planning to stop doing the work the contract was for).</p>

<p>Workers have the right:</p>

<ul>
<li>not to be unfairly dismissed after 2 years’ service (for employees who were in employment before 6 April 2012, it’s 1 year’s service)  </li>
  <li>to a written statement of reasons for not renewing the contract (after 1 year’s service)</li>
</ul>
<p>They may be entitled to statutory redundancy payments after 2 years’ service if the work ends unexpectedly.</p>

<h2>If the employer wants to end the contract earlier</h2>

<p>What happens depends on the terms of the contract. If:</p>

<ul>
<li>it says nothing about being ended early, the employer may be in breach of contract</li>
  <li>it says it can be ended early, and the employer has given proper notice, the contract can be ended</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum notice period fixed-term employees are entitled to is:</p>

<ul>
<li>after 1 month’s continuous service, but less than 2 years – 1 week</li>
  <li>after 2 years’ continuous employment – 1 week for each year worked </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>These are the minimum periods, and the contract may specify a longer notice period.</p>
</div>

<p>If an employer ends a contract without giving the proper notice, the employee may be able to claim breach of contract.</p>

<h2>Working longer than the contract’s end date</h2>

<p>If an employee continues working past the end of a contract without it being formally renewed, there’s an ‘implied agreement’ by the employer that the end date has changed.</p>

<p>The employer still needs to be give proper notice if they want to dismiss the worker.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
If a contract was for 1 month but the employee actually worked for 3 months, they’d still be entitled to the minimum notice period (1 week).</p>
</div>

<h2>The limit on renewing a fixed-term contract</h2>

<p>Any employee on a fixed-term contract for 4 or more years will automatically become a permanent employee when their contract is renewed or they are given a new contract.</p>

<p>However, an employer and unions (or a staff association) may make a collective agreement that removes the automatic right to become a permanent employee in these circumstances.</p>

<h2>Renewing a fixed-term contract on less favourable terms</h2>

<p>If an employer wants to do this, the employee can negotiate with them to reach an agreement. </p>

<p>If the contract ends and they have been unable to reach an agreement, the employee may be able to claim <a href="/dismissal" title="Dismissal">unfair dismissal</a>.</p>

<h2>Ending the contract early</h2>

<p>Employees must <a href="/handing-in-your-notice-resigning-leaving-job" title="Handing in your notice">hand in their notice</a> 1 week in advance if they’ve worked for an employer for a month or more. The contract may state that they need to give more notice.</p>
