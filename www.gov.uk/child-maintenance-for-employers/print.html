</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>The Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) can ask you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>give information about your employee so they can work out the right amount of <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency" title="child maintenance">child maintenance</a>
</li>
  <li>set up a <a href="/make-child-maintenance-deductions-employee-pay/deduction-from-earnings-order-deo" title="deduction from earnings order">deduction from earnings order</a> (<abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>answer enquiries from organisations used by the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> to collect payments of child maintenance on their behalf</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your legal obligations when deducting child maintenance</h2>

<p>By law, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>give information to the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> when requested </li>
  <li>send payments to the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> as soon as possible, but no later than the 19th day of the month following the month you took it </li>
  <li>let the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> know immediately if there are any problems with taking payments from a paying parent’s earnings</li>
  <li>make regular payments - if you don’t send payments to the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> and don’t tell them why, they can take you to court </li>
  <li>tell the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> in writing within 10 days of an employee leaving your business </li>
  <li>tell the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> in writing within 10 days if they ask you to set up a deduction from earnings order (<abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr>) for someone who doesn’t work for you </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to statutory child maintenance services</h2>

<p>A new child maintenance scheme (‘the 2012 scheme’) has been introduced. It’s managed by the Child Maintenance Service and will run alongside the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> schemes. </p>

<p>This will change the way <abbr title="deduction from earnings orders">DEOs</abbr> work. The changes probably won’t affect you immediately and you don’t need to take any action until the Child Maintenance Service asks you to. </p>

<p>Email the Child Maintenance Service if you have any questions about the upcoming changes.</p>

</article><article id="deduction-from-earnings-order-deo"><header><h1>Part 2: Deduction from earnings order (DEO)</h1>
  </header><p>This is a way of collecting <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency" title="child maintenance">child maintenance</a> directly from a paying parent’s earnings or pension.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘paying parent’ is the parent the child doesn’t live with.</p>
</div>

<p>The Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>), or an authorised debt collection agency, will send you a deduction from earnings order (<abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr>) if one of your employees is a paying parent who:</p>

<ul>
<li>chooses to pay child maintenance direct from their earnings</li>
  <li>doesn’t pay the correct amount of child maintenance on time</li>
  <li>doesn’t pay at all</li>
</ul>
<p>You must deduct the amount of child maintenance stated on the <abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr> from your employee’s <a href="/make-child-maintenance-deductions-employee-pay/what-the-child-support-agency-counts-as-earnings" title="net earnings">net earnings</a> or their pension and <a href="/make-child-maintenance-deductions-employee-pay/making-payments-to-the-child-support-agency" title="pay it to the CSA">pay it to the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr></a>. This will include any arrears that may be due.</p>

<h2>If you get more than one <abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr> for an employee</h2>

<p>You could get more than one <abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr> if your employee is paying maintenance for children by different ‘receiving parents’. You need to make a payment for each <abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘receiving parent’ is the parent or carer the child lives with.</p>
</div>

<h2>Other court orders against your employee</h2>

<p>You could get a <abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr> from the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> and an attachment of earnings order (<abbr title="attachment of earnings order">AEO</abbr>) from a court. </p>

<p><abbr title="attachment of earnings orders">AEOs</abbr> work in a similar way to <abbr title="deduction from earnings orders">DEOs</abbr>, but there are rules about which money you should take first.</p>

<p>You can download a leaflet that tells you more about <abbr title="attachment of earnings orders">AEOs</abbr>.</p>

</article><article id="how-deduction-from-earnings-orders-work"><header><h1>Part 3: How deduction from earnings orders work</h1>
  </header><p>The <a href="/make-child-maintenance-deductions-employee-pay/deduction-from-earnings-order-deo" title="deduction from earnings order">deduction from earnings order</a> (<abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr>) will give you information you need to make deductions, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>the <strong>normal deduction rate</strong> (<abbr title="normal deduction rate">NDR</abbr>) - the amount of <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency" title="child maintenance">child maintenance</a> the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) takes from your employee’s <a href="/make-child-maintenance-deductions-employee-pay/what-the-child-support-agency-counts-as-earnings" title="net earnings">net earnings</a> in each pay period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <strong>protected earnings rate</strong> (<abbr title="protected earnings rate">PER</abbr>) or <strong>protected earnings proportion</strong> (<abbr title="protected earnings proportion">PEP</abbr>) - the amount your employee needs to keep to pay for their own living costs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the date the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> expects you to start making deductions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how often you should <a href="/make-child-maintenance-deductions-employee-pay/making-payments-to-the-child-support-agency" title="make payments">make payments</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The <abbr title="protected earnings rate">PER</abbr> applies to cases opened before 3 March 2003. The <abbr title="protected earnings proportion">PEP</abbr> applies to cases opened from 3 March 2003.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example - deducting the full <abbr title="normal deduction rate">NDR</abbr>:</strong></p>

<p>Your employee’s net earnings are £160 a week.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="normal deduction rate">NDR</abbr> is £30 a week and the <abbr title="protected earnings rate">PER</abbr> is £100 a week.</p>

<p>Net earnings minus the <abbr title="protected earnings rate">PER</abbr> of £100 = £60, so you’d send the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> the full <abbr title="normal deduction rate">NDR</abbr> of £30.</p>

<p>You can deduct up to £1 for administration costs.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you can’t make a full deduction</h2>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep a record of the shortfall (the difference between the net earnings and the <abbr title="protected earnings rate">PER</abbr> or <abbr title="protected earnings proportion">PEP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>carry forward the shortfall to the next period</li>
  <li>send the deduction, if there is one, to the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You then deduct the full amount of the shortfall plus the <abbr title="normal deduction rate">NDR</abbr> the next pay period. You must still leave your employee with the <abbr title="protected earnings rate">PER</abbr> or <abbr title="protected earnings proportion">PEP</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the shortfall is carried forward for several weeks before being repaid, keep a record of the ongoing shortfall.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example - where you can’t take the full <abbr title="normal deduction rate">NDR</abbr>:</strong></p>

<p>Your employee’s net earnings are £120 a week.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="normal deduction rate">NDR</abbr> is £32 a week and the <abbr title="protected earnings rate">PER</abbr> is £96 a week.</p>

<p>Net earnings minus the <abbr title="protected earnings rate">PER</abbr> of £96 = £24, so you’d send the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> £24. The shortfall of £8 is carried forward to the next pay period.</p>

<p>You can deduct up to £1 for administration costs.</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>When you make deductions, you must make sure that you leave your employee with the amount of their <abbr title="protected earnings rate">PER</abbr> or <abbr title="protected earnings proportion">PEP</abbr> - unless the deduction is for administrative costs.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you pay your employee holiday pay in advance</h2>

<p>You’ll need to multiply the <abbr title="normal deduction rate">NDR</abbr> and the <abbr title="protected earnings rate">PER</abbr> or <abbr title="protected earnings proportion">PEP</abbr> in line with the net earnings.</p>

<p>This means if you double the net earnings because you’re paying 2 weeks instead of one, you’ll need to double the <abbr title="normal deduction rate">NDR</abbr> and the <abbr title="protected earnings proportion">PEP</abbr> or <abbr title="protected earnings rate">PER</abbr>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example - including holiday pay in advance:</strong></p>

<p>In this example, the earnings include 2 weeks’ holiday pay paid in advance.</p>

<p>Your employee has net earnings of £160 a week. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="normal deduction rate">NDR</abbr> is £32 a week and the <abbr title="protected earnings proportion">PEP</abbr> is £96 a week. </p>

<p>Net earnings are £160 x 3 = £480 (1 week’s pay + 2 weeks’ holiday pay).</p>

<p>Take away the <abbr title="protected earnings proportion">PEP</abbr> of £96 x 3 (£288). This leaves £192, so you’d send the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> the full <abbr title="normal deduction rate">NDR</abbr> of £96 (£32 x 3).</p>

<p>You can deduct up to £1 for administration costs.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you get more than one <abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr> for an employee</h2>

<p>Sometimes a paying parent has more than one case and is paying child maintenance for children by different receiving parents. </p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="deduction from earnings orders">DEOs</abbr> depends on when the cases were opened:</p>

<ul>
<li>for cases opened after 3 March 2003 - there will only ever be one <abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr> (you make one payment to the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> and it gets split later)</li>
  <li>for cases opened before 3 March 2003 - you might get more than one <abbr title="deduction from earnings order">DEO</abbr> and need to make a payment for each</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘paying parent’ is the parent the child doesn’t live with. The ‘receiving parent’ is the parent the child lives with.</p>
