</article><article id="what-sponsors-must-do"><header><h1>Part 3: What sponsors must do</h1>
  </header><p>Sponsors must:</p>

<ul>
<li>follow the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/business-sponsors/points/sponsoringmigrants/employingmigrants/codesofpractice/" title="Code of Practice">code of practice</a> for sponsoring skilled workers</li>

  <li>keep records of your employee</li>
  <li>report changes in your employee’s working status to the UK Border Agency (<abbr title="UK Border Agency">UKBA</abbr>), eg if they stop showing up for work or they resign  </li>
  <li>follow immigration laws</li>
</ul>
<p>If a sponsor doesn’t follow these duties, their licence can be downgraded (from A to B status), suspended or taken away.</p>

<p>Employers must give their employee a certificate of sponsorship so they can apply for a visa or extension of their stay. </p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>If a sponsored employee thinks that their employer has given false information or isn’t carrying out their duties, they can get in touch with the Sponsor Licensing Unit.</p>

<div class="contact">

</article><article id="certificate-of-sponsorship"><header><h1>Part 4: Certificate of sponsorship</h1>
  </header><p>The certificate is a virtual document with a unique reference number that lets employees apply for a visa or extension of their stay.  </p>

<p>You must pay for each certificate of sponsorship you give but don’t get a refund if your employee does not use it.</p>

<h2>Deadline to apply</h2>

<p>Once a certificate of sponsorship is assigned to someone, they have 3 months to use it to apply for a visa or an extension of their stay. If they don’t apply within that time the certificate will run out and they’ll need to get a new one from their sponsor.</p>

<h2>If a sponsored employee changes their employment</h2>

<p>If an employee wants to change their employment (with the same or a new employer) they must reapply under the points based system.</p>

<p>The only exception is if they work with the same sponsor and the new job will be the same <a rel="external" href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/archived-standard-classifications/standard-occupational-classification-2000/dissemination-media-and-availability/index.html" title="standard occupational classfication">standard occupational classification</a> as their original certificate of sponsorship.</p>

<h2>If a sponsored person changes their mind about taking a job</h2>

<p>If a prospective employee has a certificate of sponsorship assigned to them but decides not to take the job because they want to work for another sponsor, they should:</p>

<ul>
<li>contact the original sponsor and ask them to withdraw their certificate of sponsorship</li>
  <li>get a certificate from the other sponsor once the first certificate has been withdrawn</li>
</ul>
<p>An applicant can only have one certificate assigned to them at a time.</p>
