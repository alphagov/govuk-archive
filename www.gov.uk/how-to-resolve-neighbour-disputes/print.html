</ol></article><article id="talk-to-your-neighbour"><header><h1>Part 2: Talk to your neighbour</h1>
  </header><h2>Solving the problem informally</h2>
<p>Before making a formal complaint or getting others involved, try to discuss the problem with your neighbour. </p>

<p>If you’re worried about approaching them, write a letter, explaining the problem clearly and sticking to the facts.</p>

<p>If the problem affects other neighbours, involve them as well. It can be easier to settle a dispute if the complaint comes from a number of people. </p>

<p>A tenants’ association might help if you’re a member of one.</p>

</div>

</article><article id="contact-your-neighbours-landlord"><header><h1>Part 3: Contact your neighbour's landlord</h1>
  </header><p>If your neighbour is a tenant, you can complain to their landlord. This could be a <a rel="external" href="http://www.housingnet.co.uk/housingassociations.php" title="Find a housing association">housing association,</a> the <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">council</a> or a private landlord.</p>

</article><article id="use-a-mediation-service"><header><h1>Part 4: Use a mediation service</h1>
  </header><p>If you can’t resolve the dispute by speaking to your neighbour, get help from a mediation service.</p>

<h2>How mediation works</h2>
<p>Mediation is when an impartial person - trained in dealing with difficult discussions between 2 opposing sides - acts like a referee in a dispute.</p>

<p>There can be a fee for mediation, but this will still be cheaper than hiring a solicitor and taking legal action.</p>

<h2>Contact a mediation service</h2>

<p>Mediation services differ depending on where you live:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you live in England and Wales, find a mediation provider in your area on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.civilmediation.justice.gov.uk/" title="Find a mediation provider in England and Wales">Ministry of Justice website</a>
</li>
  <li>in Scotland, use the <a rel="external" href="http://www.scottishmediation.org.uk/" title="Find a mediation provider in Scotland">Scottish Mediation Network</a>
</li>
  <li>your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Contact your local council">council</a> or housing association may provide a mediation service</li>
  <li>the charity <a rel="external" href="http://www.lawworks.org.uk/lw_mediation" title="LawWorks mediation">LawWorks</a> provides free mediation</li>
</ul></article><article id="complain-about-noise-to-the-council"><header><h1>Part 5: Complain about noise to the council</h1>
  </header><p>You can ask <a href="/report-noise-pollution-to-council" title="Report a noise nuisance your local council" rel="external">your local council</a> for help if the neighbour dispute involves an activity that is damaging to health or a nuisance. This is known as a <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/noise/nuisance/" title="Statutory nuisance: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">‘statutory nuisance’.</a></p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>noise (including loud music and barking dogs)</li>
  <li>artificial light (except street lamps)</li>
  <li>dust, steam, smell or insects from business premises </li>
  <li>smoke, fumes or gases</li>
  <li>a build-up of rubbish that could harm health</li>
</ul>
<p>Your <a href="/report-noise-pollution-to-council" title="Report a noise nuisance your local council" rel="external">local council</a> has a duty to investigate any statutory nuisance.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You should always try and solve the problem by talking to your neighbour or through mediation before contacting the council.</p>
</div>

<h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>If the council decides someone is causing a statutory noise nuisance they must issue a ‘noise abatement’  order. This tells the person what they must do to stop making a noise nuisance or else face further legal action.  </p>

<p>If someone breaks an abatement order about noise from their home, they can be fined up to £5,000. If it’s noise from a factory or business, the penalty can be up to £20,000.</p>


</article><article id="high-hedges-trees-and-boundaries"><header><h1>Part 6: High hedges, trees and boundaries</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re having a dispute about a high hedge, your council can only take action if the hedge is:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 or more mostly evergreen or semi-evergreen trees or shrubs</li>
  <li>over 2 metres tall</li>
  <li>affecting your enjoyment of your home or garden because it’s too tall</li>
  <li>affecting your property</li>
</ul>
<p>If the hedge is in any of these categories, <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Contact your local council">ask your council</a> for a complaint form. You might have to pay the council a fee to consider your complaint.</p>

</div>

<h3>Your rights to trim hedges or trees</h3>
<p>You can trim branches or roots that cross into your property up to the property boundary. If you do more than this, your neighbour could take you to court for damaging their property.</p>

<p>If you live in a conservation area, or the trees in the hedge are protected by a <a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/guideprotectedtrees" title="Protected trees: A guide to tree preservation procedures">‘tree preservation order’,</a> you might need <a href="/apply-work-on-protected-tree" title="Apply to work on a tree that's protected">your council’s permission</a> to trim them.</p>

<h3>Property damage from hedges</h3>

<p>Your neighbour is responsible for maintaining their hedges so they don’t, for example, damage your property or grow too high. If they do damage your property, your neighbour may be liable. </p>

<h2>Boundaries and shared (‘party’) walls</h2>
<p>Disputes about <a href="/your-property-boundaries%20%E2%80%9CYour%20property%20boundaries%E2%80%9D">what is the exact boundary</a> between 2 properties can be difficult to solve so get legal advice. </p>

<p>You must give notice to your neighbour if you are going to do work on a shared (‘party’) wall. </p>

</article><article id="call-the-police"><header><h1>Part 7: Call the police</h1>
  </header><p>You should call <a rel="external" href="http://www.police.uk" title="Find your local policing team">the police</a> if your neighbour:</p>

<ul>
<li>is violent, threatening or abusive</li>
  <li>is harassing you sexually, or because of your sexuality, religion or ethnic background</li>
  <li>is breaching the peace (being disorderly in the street or making a lot of noise)</li>
  <li>is breaking the law in any other way - or if you suspect this</li>
</ul></article><article id="take-action-through-the-courts"><header><h1>Part 8: Take action through the courts</h1>
  </header><p>If all else fails, you can take legal action against a neighbour. </p>

<p>Taking someone to court can be expensive so it should be your last resort if nothing else works. There may be <a href="/court-fees-what-they-are" title="Court fees - what they are">court fees</a> and you may have to pay a solicitor. </p>

<h2>Legal advice</h2>
<p>You can get free legal advice from a law centre, advice centre or <a rel="external" href="http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/index/your_family/home_and_neighbourhood_index_ew/problems_where_you_live_index_ew/neighbour_disputes.htm" title="Advice on neighbour disputes: Citizens Advice">Citizens Advice.</a></p>
