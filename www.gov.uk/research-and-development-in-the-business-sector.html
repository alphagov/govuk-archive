<h2 id="what-is-rd">What is <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>?</h2>

<p>In the UK, the accounting definition of <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> (research and development) is contained in the Statement of Accounting Practice (SSAP) 13 and for international companies, International Accounting Standard (IAS 38) both of which are based on the <abbr title="The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> ‘Frascati’ manual. This definition is modified for tax purposes by the guidelines on the meaning of <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> for tax purposes issued by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.</p>

<p>Although the UK has a strong science base, UK businesses as a whole invest less in <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> than their main international competitors. Business <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> has increased in real terms in recent years, but has not risen as a share of UK national wealth as measured by GDP. The <a rel="external" href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/default.asp">Office for National Statistics</a> publishes figures on <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> expenditure.</p>

<p>The government is determined to close the UK’s productivity gap with comparable international economies and is seeking to boost UK <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> investment to 2.5% of GDP by 2014.</p>

<p>An increase in the levels of business <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> will stimulate business innovation and help raise productivity, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which undertakes the majority of <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> in the UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> tax credits are an incentive in the form of tax relief for companies of all sizes to raise their investment in <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>. The tax credits work by allowing companies to deduct qualifying expenditure on <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> activities when calculating their profit for tax purposes. </p>

<h2 id="investing-in-rd">Investing in <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There has been an increase in the levels of overseas business investment for commercial <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> conducted in the UK. This investment is a good indicator of the continued competitiveness of the UK as a location of choice for the increasing globalisation of corporate <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> also plays an essential role in the innovation process, which is increasingly important to current and future profits for UK companies. It results in the technology that brings new products and services to the marketplace. Innovation results in high quality jobs, successful businesses, better goods and services, and more efficient processes. International research has consistently demonstrated the positive correlation between <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> investment intensity and company performance measures such as sales growth and share price in the sectors where <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> is important. Businesses are in a better position to achieve and maintain competitive advantage in the increasingly global marketplace with sustained <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> and other related investment at the right levels.</p>

<p>Furthermore, companies that carry out <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> may be in a position to claim tax relief through <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> tax credits schemes. <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> tax credits works by allowing companies to deduct qualifying expenditure on <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> activities when calculating their profit for tax purposes.</p>

<p>Other <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> support such as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/business-finance-support-finder">Grant for Research and Development</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.ktponline.org.uk/">Knowledge Transfer Partnerships</a> is available to help companies fulfil their <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> aspirations.</p>

<h3 id="why-rd-matters">Why <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> matters</h3>

<p>Businesses are in a better position to achieve and maintain competitive advantage in the increasingly global market place with sustained <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> and other related investment at the right levels. To maximise the benefits, investment in <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> should be combined with appropriate investment in capital equipment, market development, new business processes, and other important drivers of productivity. </p>

<h3 id="rd-and-intellectual-property">
<abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> and intellectual property</h3>

<p><abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> results in valuable inventions, ideas and designs which can be a source of potential value when it comes to gaining competitive advantage. A variety of intellectual property rights exists to help a company protect these valuable assets. For example, a patent can be used to protect products or processes that possess new functional or technical aspects. Patent rights make it illegal for an unauthorised person to profit from an invention. Contact the  <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/">UK Intellectual Property Office</a> for more information about intellectual property rights.</p>

<h2 id="support-for-business-research-and-development-and-innovation">Support for business research and development and innovation</h2>

<p><abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> tax credits provide tax relief - or, in some cases, cash for companies not in profit - to encourage companies to take on more scientifically and technologically challenging research and development. Other tax breaks include capital allowances for investment in equipment and premises.</p>

<p>Most other government support for business has been re-organised into a single portfolio of 30 products, presented under ‘solutions for business’. This is intended to make it much clearer to business what is available and to improve access. This follows an extensive process of streamlining the thousands of publicly funded support schemes previously available. The portfolio includes a number of new offers for business. </p>

<p>A number of the products are particularly relevant to business <abbr title="research and development and innovation">R&amp;D&amp;I</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>collaborative <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> - grant to businesses working together and with the knowledge base to develop and exploit new ideas</li>
  <li>networking for innovation - supports businesses to build relationships with knowledge base institutions to develop and exploit new ideas</li>
  <li>knowledge transfer partnerships -  grant to enable the placement of a recently qualified person in a business, or the exchange of staff between businesses and  knowledge base institutions</li>
  <li>low carbon energy demonstration -  finance to assist a range of demonstration activity to commercially exploit <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> in low carbon energy generating technology</li>
  <li>‘Smart’ (formerly known as ‘Grant for Research and Development’) - finance to help a business to develop and exploit new ideas</li>
  <li>innovation advice and guidance - this product aims to provide businesses with expert knowledge and highly specialised, technical and advanced skills, enabling them to innovate and improve performance</li>
  <li>several of the other products address financing or coaching needs</li>
</ul>
<p>The Technology Strategy Board (TSB) stimulates technology-enabled innovation in the areas which offer the greatest scope for boosting UK growth and productivity. The TSB:</p>

<ul>
<li>promotes, supports and invests in technology research, development and commercialisation</li>
  <li>spreads knowledge, bringing people together to solve problems or make new advances</li>
  <li>advises government on how to remove barriers to innovation and accelerate the exploitation of new technologies</li>
  <li>works in areas where there is a clear potential business benefit, helping today’s emerging technologies become the growth sectors of tomorrow</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information visit the <a rel="external" href="http://www.innovateuk.org/aboutus.ashx">TSB website</a></p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.innovateuk.org/deliveringinnovation/smallbusinessresearchinitiative.ashx">The Small Business Research Initiative (<abbr title="Small Business Research Initiative">SBRI</abbr>)</a> invites companies to tender for work directed towards addressing specific research challenges identified by government departments. These challenges are advertised in the form of competitions and companies are invited to put forward responses to these. </p>

<p>The part government support plays in business’s decision making about undertaking <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>, has been investigated in research commissioned by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>. See the report, <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/research/reports.htm">‘Qualitative research into businesses’ Research and Development (<abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>) decision-making processes’</a> prepared by Databuild Research and Solutions Ltd (August 2010).
