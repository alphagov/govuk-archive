  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="when-payment-becomes-late"><header><h1>Part 1: When does a payment become late?</h1>
  </header><p>You can claim interest and debt recovery costs if another business is late paying for goods or a service.</p>

<p>If you haven’t already agreed when the money will be paid, the law says the payment is late 30 days after either:</p>

<ul>
<li>the customer gets the invoice</li>
  <li>you deliver the goods or provide the service (if this is later)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Think about your relationship to the customer before adding interest or costs, and give them another chance to pay.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="charging-interest-commercial-debt"><header><h1>Part 2: Interest on late commercial payments</h1>
  </header><p>The interest you can charge if another business is late paying for goods or a service is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘statutory interest’ - this is 8% plus the Bank of England base rate</li>
  <li>‘contractual interest’ - the rate of interest for a late payment in a contract</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can’t claim statutory interest if there’s a different rate of interest in a contract.</p>
</div>

<p>The current Bank of England base rate is 0.5%, so statutory interest for a recent debt would be 8.5%.</p>

<p>Check the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/iadb/Repo.asp" title="Bank of England base rate history">Bank of England base rate history.</a> </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

<p>If your business were owed £1,000:  </p>

<ul>
<li>the annual statutory interest on this would be £85 (1,000 x 0.085 = £85)  </li>
  <li>divide £85 by 365 to get the daily interest: 23p a day (85 / 365 = 0.23)  </li>
  <li>after 50 days this would be £11.50 (50 x 0.23 = 11.50)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Send a new invoice if you decide to add interest to the money you’re owed.</p>

</article><article id="claim-debt-recovery-costs"><header><h1>Part 3: Claim debt recovery costs on late payments</h1>
  </header><p>You can charge a business a fixed sum for the cost of recovering a late commercial payment.</p>

<p>The basic amount you’re allowed to charge is:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Amount of debt</th>
      <th>What you can charge</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Up to £999.99</td>
      <td>£40</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>£1,000 to £9,999.99</td>
      <td>£70</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>£10,000 or more</td>
      <td>£100</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>These amounts are set by late payment legislation.</p>
</div>

<p>You can also charge reasonable additional debt recovery costs - eg if you use an accountant, solicitor or debt collection agency to recover the debt.</p>

<p>Write to the customer if you decide to add this charge, and send them a new invoice.</p>
