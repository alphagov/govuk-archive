<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you introduce certain fish and shellfish diseases to places where they are not currently found, they can cause significant economic and environmental damage. These ‘notifiable’ diseases are classified as either exotic or non-exotic. All notifiable diseases are strictly controlled. If you suspect that your stock is infected you are legally required to tell the Fish Health Inspectorate (<abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will normally request the restriction of fish and shellfish on your site so they can investigate the suspected outbreak and test for the disease. These restrictions will be lifted if the tests are negative or - if a disease is confirmed - once the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> is satisfied your site has been properly cleared, cleansed and disinfected.</p>

<p>This guide gives details of each notifiable disease and explains their symptoms and the species they affect. It also provides advice to help you reduce the possibility of outbreaks of disease at your site.</p>

<h2 id="notifiable-fish-and-shellfish-diseases">Notifiable fish and shellfish diseases</h2>

<p>For many years, the government has tried to prevent serious fish, shellfish and crustacean diseases being introduced to Great Britain. This has been a significant factor in making sure Great Britain has maintained a high aquatic animal health status, remaining free from the most serious diseases.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s national fish health rules were replaced by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules. These are designed to encourage trade within the single market and, at the same time, protect parts of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a high aquatic animal health status - eg Great Britain.</p>

<h3 id="notifiable-diseases">Notifiable diseases</h3>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Council Directive 2006/88/EC sets out legislation to prevent and control certain diseases in aquatic animals. These diseases are ‘notifiable’ - ie the owner or anyone else attending to the animals must immediately report suspicion of notifiable diseases to the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Notifiable diseases are categorised as either exotic or non-exotic. Exotic diseases are those diseases not currently present in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. They could have a significant economic and environmental impact if they were introduced. If an Exotic disease is detected, all infected fish and shellfish must be destroyed as soon as possible. See the page in this guide on exotic notifiable diseases.</p>

<p>Non-exotic diseases are those that are present in parts of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, under containment and subject to long-term eradication. They are controlled to prevent them spreading to unaffected areas of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. See the page in this guide on non-exotic notifiable diseases.</p>

<p>As well as exotic and non-exotic diseases, there are other notifiable diseases that are present in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and which are controlled by national programmes. See the page in this guide on other notifiable diseases.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> also has powers to prevent the spread of new and emerging diseases, that are not listed but that have the potential to present a significant economic or environmental threat to our aquatic animal populations.</p>

<h3 id="measures-to-prevent-the-spread-of-notifiable-and-emerging-diseases">Measures to prevent the spread of notifiable and emerging diseases</h3>

<p>The spread of notifiable diseases is controlled by:</p>

<ul>
<li>strict rules for importing live fish, molluscs and crustacea - see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/importing-live-fish-molluscs-and-crustacea">importing live fish, molluscs and crustacea</a>
</li>
  <li>regular monitoring of fish, shellfish and crustacean farms by the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> to check for disease</li>
  <li>speedy containment of outbreaks of serious disease where detected by the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> or notified by someone else - see the page in this guide on how fish and shellfish diseases are contained</li>
  <li>operators of fish farms, shellfish farms, crustacean farms, and fisheries taking all the necessary precautions when buying, selling, keeping and moving live aquatic animals - see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-fish-and-shellfish">moving fish and shellfish</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-fish-and-shellfish-diseases-are-contained">How fish and shellfish diseases are contained</h2>

<p>Where a notifiable disease is suspected in aquatic animals (fish, molluscs or crustaceans), the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will undertake an investigation and samples will be taken for diagnostic testing. The <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will also apply controls to the affected area in the form of an initial designation notice in order to minimise the risk of any further disease spreading.</p>

<h3 id="initial-designation-notice">Initial designation notice</h3>

<p>An initial designation notice will be issued where the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> suspect that a listed or notifiable disease is present, and will remain in force while diagnostic tests are undertaken to determine this.</p>

<p>An initial designation notice is a temporary ‘standstill’ notice that is usually served to the owner or operator of the affected site or area. It will be served in the form of a written notice, describing the control area and the restrictions applied to prevent any further spread of disease.</p>

<p>These control measures restrict movements of aquatic animals into, out of and within the affected area. Where relevant, controls also extend to the movement of equipment and vehicles liable to transmit disease and the application of additional site biosecurity measures while there is evidence of clinical disease and a risk of transfer of infection.</p>

<p>If the tests results prove negative for a notifiable disease, the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will lift an initial designation notice immediately.</p>

<h3 id="confirmed-designation">Confirmed Designation</h3>

<p>Where the presence of a notifiable disease is confirmed through diagnostic testing, and the affected site is unable to undertake an immediate <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>-supervised site clearance and disinfection, the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will issue a Confirmed Designation.</p>

<p>A Confirmed Designation is a public and legal order restricting aquatic animal movements into, out of and within the affected area without prior written permission from the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>, and remains in force until the disease is no longer present in the designated area. Under the Confirmed Designation, additional control measures may also be applied to vehicle and equipment movements and disinfection, additional site biosecurity measures and the display of public information notices.</p>

<p>A confirmed designation will not be lifted until the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> are satisfied that the disease in question is no longer present. Under the current policy of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>), this is achieved by either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a complete stock cull and disinfection of all waters within the designated area, or</li>
  <li>completion of a satisfactory monitoring and retest programme to standards specified in European legislation</li>
</ul>
<p>Sites undergoing a monitoring and retest programme must expect to remain under a Confirmed Designation for a minimum of four years and will be instructed to undertake a sequential/staged site clearance and disinfection wherever this is practical.</p>

<h2 id="exotic-notifiable-diseases">Exotic notifiable diseases</h2>

<p>Exotic notifiable diseases are not currently present within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> - if they were to be introduced to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, they could cause significant economic problems for the aquaculture sector. They could also harm wild species. In general, there is no treatment for exotic notifiable diseases, and any outbreak could only be controlled by killing or destroying all affected animals. If you suspect that your stock is infected with one of these diseases, you must notify the Fish Health Inspectorate as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="exotic-notifiable-diseases-affecting-fish">Exotic notifiable diseases affecting fish</h3>

<p>There are two exotic notifiable fish diseases listed, epizootic ulcerative syndrome (<abbr title="epizootic ulcerative syndrome">EUS</abbr>) and epizootic haematopoietic necrosis (<abbr title="epizootic haematopoietic necrosis">EHN</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="epizootic ulcerative syndrome">EUS</abbr> is a serious disease that affects over 100 species of fresh and brackish water fish. There is no treatment for the disease and it has a mortality rate of up to 80 per cent. The external symptoms of <abbr title="epizootic ulcerative syndrome">EUS</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>red spots</li>
  <li>blackish burn-like marks</li>
  <li>deep ulcers at the base of the fins and over the body</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="epizootic haematopoietic necrosis">EHN</abbr> is a serious systemic viral disease that is known to affect rainbow trout and perch. There is no treatment for <abbr title="epizootic haematopoietic necrosis">EHN</abbr> and it has a mortality rate of up to 100 per cent in perch, lower in rainbow trout. The external symptoms of <abbr title="epizootic haematopoietic necrosis">EHN</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>abdominal distension</li>
  <li>darkening of the body</li>
  <li>reddening fin bases</li>
  <li>skin ulcers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-exotic-notifiable-diseases">Non-exotic notifiable diseases</h2>

<p>Non-exotic notifiable diseases are present in parts of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. If they were to spread to other areas of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, they could cause significant economic problems for the aquaculture sector. They could also harm wild species. For many of these diseases there is no treatment, and in such cases outbreaks are controlled by killing or destroying all affected animals. If you suspect that your stock is infected with one of these diseases, you must notify the Fish Health Inspectorate as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="preventing-disease-on-your-fish-or-shellfish-farm">Preventing disease on your fish or shellfish farm</h2>

<p>There are a number of steps you can take to make sure you are doing everything possible to prevent disease being introduced to your fish farm.</p>

<h3 id="fish-and-shellfish-health">Fish and shellfish health</h3>

<p>Steps you can take to protect the health of your fish and shellfish include:</p>

<ul>
<li>stocking only certified, disease-free fish and shellfish from a reputable supplier</li>
  <li>training your staff in hygienic fish and shellfish handling and disease prevention methods</li>
  <li>keeping health and treatment records</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="husbandry">Husbandry</h3>

<p>Good fish and shellfish husbandry practices include:</p>

<ul>
<li>using a pathogen-free water supply, such as a borehole or a spring, or ultraviolet/ozone treated water</li>
  <li>supplying water to each holding facility independently, avoiding water flowing from one tank to another</li>
  <li>preventing fish and shellfish from being under undue stress from over-stocking or poor water quality</li>
  <li>carrying out regular veterinary checks and introducing vaccination programmes and disease treatments where necessary</li>
  <li>removing dead fish and shellfish on a daily basis and disposing of them correctly</li>
  <li>managing pests to prevent the spread of disease from vermin or predators</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="moving-fish-and-shellfish">Moving fish and shellfish</h3>

<p>When you move fish and shellfish there are various measures you can take to prevent disease, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>exercising caution when you transfer fish and shellfish between different farms</li>
  <li>properly cleaning and disinfecting lorries and tanks used to transport fish and shellfish before loading and after each delivery of fish and shellfish</li>
  <li>making only single-site deliveries by lorry, wherever possible</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="operating-practices">Operating practices</h3>

<p>There are many ways that you can increase biosecurity in the day-to-day running of your farm, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping production, processing and recreational areas independent and separate from one another</li>
  <li>isolating each unit on the farm and using separate equipment in each unit</li>
  <li>containing water, blood, packaging and organic waste that comes from slaughter and processing sites and not allowing them to be taken back to production areas</li>
  <li>providing disinfection facilities between production areas</li>
  <li>requiring visitors to wear protective clothing</li>
  <li>disinfecting hands, boots and equipment when moving between different holding facilities</li>
  <li>limiting access to production areas, for example by locating a car park some distance away</li>
  <li>providing disinfectant facilities and signs requiring visitors to disinfect their boots and equipment when they enter and leave the farm</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preventing-disease-at-your-fishery">Preventing disease at your fishery</h2>

<p>Every year the Fish Health Inspectorate (<abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>) and the Environment Agency typically investigate outbreaks of disease at over 100 stillwater fisheries, that resulted in the deaths of thousands of fish and damaged the businesses or clubs that operate them. Recovering from an outbreak of disease can take a long time and can be very expensive.</p>

<p>In many cases, these outbreaks could have been avoided by:</p>

<ul>
<li>the prompt identification of signs of disease</li>
  <li>reducing stress with proper stocking numbers and correctly managed habitats</li>
  <li>improving water quality</li>
  <li>introducing biosecurity measures</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disease-identification">Disease identification</h3>

<p>By promptly identifying the signs of disease, you can take action to prevent deaths among your fish. So it is very important to check the health and condition of your fish on a regular basis. Signs to look out for include changes in behaviour as well as any external clinical symptoms of disease. <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/commercial/32870.aspx">Download guidance on recognising fish diseases from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 305KB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fish-stocking-density">Fish stocking density</h3>

<p>Having large numbers of fish in your fishery can be attractive to anglers, but only if the fish are healthy. Over-stocking your fishery can cause a number of problems, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>increased risk of diseases spreading</li>
  <li>reduced water quality as oxygen levels are lowered and toxin levels are increased</li>
  <li>increased fish stress through competition for food and space</li>
  <li>reduced numbers of plants leading to habitat damage and reduced water quality</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fish-habitats">Fish habitats</h3>

<p>Having different habitats in your fishery is good for the health of your fish, and improves the appearance of your site. Habitat features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>trees and bushes on the bankside</li>
  <li>aquatic plants in the water</li>
  <li>areas of deep and shallow water</li>
  <li>small islands</li>
</ul>
<p>These help to reduce competition between fish and lower stress levels. Aquatic plants put oxygen into the water, helping to improve its quality and prevent disease. <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Business/geho0606bkupep_1724915.pdf">Download guidance on improving habitats from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 1.37MB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="water-quality">Water quality</h3>

<p>Without good quality water your fish cannot survive and thrive. Poor water quality, or any sudden changes to quality, can increase the stress levels of your fish. For details of the issues you need to monitor, <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Business/deoxygenation__eng_171216.pdf">download guidance on de-oxygenation in fisheries from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 399KB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="biosecurity">Biosecurity</h3>

<p>There are certain steps you can take to improve the biosecurity of your fishery, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>breeding your own fish, or stocking only from reputable suppliers</li>
  <li>disinfecting key pieces of equipment</li>
  <li>using a borehole or spring as your water source if possible</li>
  <li>making improvements to the security of your site</li>
