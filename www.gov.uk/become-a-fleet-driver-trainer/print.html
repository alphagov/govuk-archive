</article><article id="taking-check-tests"><header><h1>Part 9: Taking check tests</h1>
  </header><p>You have to take regular <a href="/adi-check-test-what-to-expect" title="Check tests">check tests</a> as an approved driving instructor (ADI).</p>

<p>You have to take a <strong>fleet check test</strong> if you’re on the fleet driver trainer register. This assesses your continuing ability to instruct someone with a full driving licence. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You don’t have to take an extra check test with a learner driver - the fleet check test will act as your ADI check test.</p>
</div>

<p>Make sure that the Driving Standards Agency examiner knows you’re on the register of fleet driver trainers when you go for your check test.</p>

<h2>How the test works</h2>

<p>Check tests are based on the examiner observing a normal lesson which should last for around 1 hour. After the lesson you should allow at least 15 minutes for the debrief.</p>

<p>There are 3 possible ways for your fleet check to be carried out.</p>

<h3>Option 1 - a customer you haven’t assessed</h3>

<p>You can bring a customer who you haven’t assessed and give an occupational risk presentation to them, and then introduce them to the training vehicle, covering the safety checks. You’d have to do a driver assessment and profile to establish their main risk areas and provide the necessary coaching.</p>

<h3>Option 2 - a customer you’ve assessed</h3>

<p>You can bring a customer you’ve already assessed. You’ll need to tell the examiner what main risk areas you intend to provide coaching for and do that during the check test.</p>

<h3>Option 3 - a role-play check test</h3>

<p>You can have a have a role-play check test. The examiner will play the role of the customer and simulate important risk faults for you to identify, analyse and coach on. </p>

<h2>Your check test result</h2>

<p>You’ll get a <a href="/adi-check-test-what-to-expect/your-check-test-grade" title="Your check test grade">grade at the end of your check test</a>. This works the same as a normal ADI check test.</p>

<h2>Being removed from the register</h2>

<p>You can end up being removed from both the ADI register and the register of fleet drivers if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>don’t pass the fleet driver check test</li>
  <li>don’t attend your fleet driver check test</li>
