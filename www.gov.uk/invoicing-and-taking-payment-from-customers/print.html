  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you sell a customer a product or a service, you need to give them an invoice (bill) by law if both you and the customer are registered for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> (a business to business transaction). An invoice is not the same as a receipt, which is an acknowledgement of payment.</p>

<p>The invoice must include <a href="/invoicing-and-taking-payment-from-customers/invoices-what-they-must-include" title="Find out what to include in an invoice">certain information</a> such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much the customer needs to pay you</li>
  <li>when the customer must pay you</li>
</ul>
<p>You and the customer also have certain <a href="/invoicing-and-taking-payment-from-customers/payment-obligations" title="payment obligations">obligations on payment.</a></p>


</article><article id="invoices-what-they-must-include"><header><h1>Part 2: Invoices - what they must include</h1>
  </header><p>You must clearly display the word ‘invoice’ on the document. You must also include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a unique identification number</li>
  <li>your company name, address and contact information</li>
  <li>the company name and address of the customer you are invoicing</li>
  <li>a clear description of what you are charging for</li>
  <li>the date the goods or service were provided (supply date)</li>
  <li>the date of the invoice</li>
  <li>the amount(s) being charged</li>
  <li>VAT amount if applicable</li>
  <li>the total amount owed</li>
</ul>
<h2>VAT invoices</h2>
<p>You’ll need to include <a href="/vat-record-keeping/vat-invoices" title="Find out about VAT invoices">additional information for VAT invoices</a>.</p>

<p>You must use these invoices if you and your customer are VAT registered.</p>

<h2>Limited company invoices</h2>

<p>If you’re a limited company, the invoice must also include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the full company name as it appears on the certificate of incorporation</li>
  <li>any business name used in your business</li>
  <li>an address where any legal documents can be delivered to you if you’re using a business name</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to put the names of the directors on your invoices, you must include the names of all directors.</p>

<h2>Sole trader invoices</h2>

<p>If you’re a sole trader, the invoice must also include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the trader’s name or any business name being used</li>
  <li>an address where any legal documents can be delivered to you if you are using a business name</li>
</ul></article><article id="payment-obligations"><header><h1>Part 3: Payment - obligations</h1>
  </header><h2>Your right to be paid</h2>

<p>You can set your own payment terms, such as discounts for early payment and payment upfront.</p>

<p>Unless you agree a payment date, the customer must pay you <strong>within 30 days</strong> of getting your invoice or the goods or service.</p>

<p>You can use a <a href="/statutory-demands" title="statutory demands">statutory demand</a> to formally request payment of what you’re owed.</p>

<h3>Charging interest for late payment</h3>

<p>You have the right to <a href="/late-commercial-payments-interest-debt-recovery/charging-interest-commercial-debt" title="charge interest for late payment">charge interest for late payment</a>, but you can choose not to.</p>

<h2>Liability for disputed card payments</h2>

<p>If a customer asks their credit or debit card issuer to reverse a transaction, they can reclaim the value of the transaction from you. This is known as a ‘chargeback’.</p>

<p>Chargebacks can be made when:</p>

<ul>
<li>the purchased item never arrived</li>
  <li>the item wasn’t as described</li>
  <li>a customer’s card was used without their permission to purchase the item fraudulently.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can be charged up to 120 days after the transaction has been debited or from when the goods or services were due to be received.</p>

<h3>Minimising chargebacks</h3>

<p>If a customer uses their <abbr title="Personal identification number">PIN</abbr>, you won’t be liable for a chargeback unless the goods aren’t as described or faulty. </p>

<p>Where you cannot accept a <abbr title="Personal identification number">PIN</abbr>, a clear signature will help but there is no guarantee against a chargeback. </p>

<p>For card-not-present transactions, such as online sales, the risks of chargeback will be higher.</p>

<h2>Regulation</h2>

<p>If you want to set up a business that takes a sum of money from a customer every time they use a service, for example, online trading, you may need to be <a rel="external" href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/Pages/Doing/Do/index.shtml" title="Check if you need to be authorised by the Financial Services Authority">authorised by the Financial Services Authority.</a></p>

<p>If customers pay you in large amounts of cash, your business may need to be 
<a href="/anti-money-laundering-registration" title="Find out how to charge interest for late payment">registered for an anti-money laundering scheme</a>.</p>

<h2>Protecting customer data</h2>

<p>You must follow the <a href="/data-protection" title="Find out the rules on customer data">rules on storing customer data</a> to protect their financial information.</p>
