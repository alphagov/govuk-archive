  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>All births must be registered within 42 days of the child being born. You should do this at the <a href="/register-offices" title="find your local register office">local register office</a> for the area where the baby was born or at the hospital before the mother leaves. The hospital will tell you if you can register the birth there.</p>

<p>If you can’t register the birth in the area where the baby was born, you can go to another register office and they will send your details to the correct office.</p>

<h2>Information you need when registering a birth</h2>

<p>When registering the birth, you should know:</p>

<ul>
<li>place and date of the birth</li>
  <li>name, surname and sex of the baby</li>
  <li>parents’ names, surnames and address</li>
  <li>places and dates of parents’ birth</li>
  <li>date of parents’ marriage or civil partnership</li>
  <li>parents’ jobs</li>
  <li>mother’s maiden surname</li>
</ul>
<p>You might not need to give all of this information, depending on who is registering the birth. You don’t need to take any documents with you to register a birth.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The Tell Us Once service can tell other government organisations about the birth for you. The registrar will let you know if this service is available in your area. If you want to use it, you can choose which organisations will be told.</p>

</article><article id="who-can-register-a-birth"><header><h1>Part 2: Who can register a birth</h1>
  </header><p>If the parents are married at the time of the birth or conception, the mother or father can register the birth on their own and include both parents’ details.</p>

<p>If the parents aren’t married the details of both parents can be included on the birth certificate if they do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>sign the birth register together</li>
  <li>one parent completes a statutory declaration of parentage form and the other takes the signed form to register the birth</li>
  <li>one parent goes to register the birth with a court order giving the father parental responsibility</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>If the mother isn’t married to the father, she can choose to register the birth on her own. The father’s details won’t be included on the birth certificate. </p>

<p>It might be possible to add the father’s details at a later date by completing an application for the re-registration of a child’s birth.</p>

</article><article id="birth-certificates"><header><h1>Part 3: Birth certificates</h1>
  </header><p>There are 2 types of birth certificate: </p>

<ul>
<li>the short version, which contains only the baby’s details</li>
  <li>the full version, which also contains the parents’ details </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have registered the birth, your baby will be issued with a short birth certificate for free.</p>

<p>If you register the birth in the area where it took place, you’ll receive a birth certificate straight away. If you register the birth in another area, you’ll receive a birth certificate in a few days. </p>

<p>You can buy extra copies of the birth certificate, as well as full versions, from the register office at any time. </p>

</article><article id="registering-a-birth-abroad"><header><h1>Part 4: Registering a birth abroad</h1>
  </header><p>If your baby is born abroad and either parent is a British citizen, you can go to either the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/find-an-embassy/" title="Find an embassy">British High Commission or the British Consul</a> in most countries to register the birth. </p>

<p>Birth certificates are issued by these authorities and can be used as proof of citizenship. </p>

<p>Births registered abroad will be processed in the UK within 12 months, after which time additional certificates can be ordered.</p>

<h2>If you’re serving abroad in the British Armed Forces</h2>

<p>If your child is born abroad while you are serving in the British Armed Forces, you can register the birth with the Forces Family Services or your Registering Officer. You should do this within 12 months of your child being born.</p>
