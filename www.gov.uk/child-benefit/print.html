<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><a href="/guardians-allowance" title="Guardian's Allowance">Guardian’s Allowance</a> is a benefit you could get if you’re bringing up someone else’s child - it’s paid on top of Child Benefit.</p>
</div>

<h2>If families split or join together</h2>

<p>If a family splits up, you get £20.30 a week for the eldest child you qualify for.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

<p>If you have 2 children and one of them stays with you, you’ll get £20.30 a week for them. If your ex-partner claims for the other child, they’ll get £20.30 a week for that child.</p>

<p>If you both claim for the same child, only one of you will get Child Benefit for them.</p>
</div>

<p>If 2 families join together, the eldest child in the new family qualifies for the £20.30 rate. If you’re entitled to Child Benefit for any other children, you’ll get the £13.40 rate for each of them.</p>

<h2>How Child Benefit is paid</h2>
<p>Child Benefit is paid into your <a href="/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid" title="how to have your benefits paid">bank account</a> every 4 weeks. You can get it paid weekly if you’re a single parent or getting certain other benefits, eg Income Support. </p>

<p>If your normal Child Benefit payment day falls on a bank holiday, when you get paid depends on where you live. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tools/childbenefit/chbcalc.htm" title="find your next Child Benefit payment date">find your next payment date</a> online.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>From April 2013 a limit will be put on the total amount of benefit that most people aged 16 to 64 can get. This is called a <a href="/benefit-cap" title="benefit cap">benefit cap</a>.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child.</p>
</div>

<p>You normally qualify for Child Benefit if you’re responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved <a href="/child-benefit-16-19" title="Child Benefit if for 16-19 year olds in education or training">education or training</a>) and you live in the UK.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Child Benefit <a href="/child-benefit-16-19/child-benefit-extensions" title="Child Benefit extension">continues for 20 weeks</a> if 16 or 17 year olds leave education or training and register with the armed services or a government sponsored careers service.</p>
</div>

<p>Eligibility rules are different if your child:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/child-benefit-child-into-care" title="Child Benefit if your child goes into care">goes into care</a></li>
  <li><a href="/child-benefit-hospital-residential-care" title="Child Benefit if your child goes into hospital or residential care">goes into hospital or residential care</a></li>
  <li><a href="/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else" title="Child Benefit if your child lives with someone else">lives with someone else</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Adoptions and fostering</h2>
<p>If you’re adopting a child, apply for Child Benefit as soon as the child come to live with you - you don’t have to wait until the adoption process is complete. </p>

<p>The nationality of the child doesn’t affect whether you’re entitled to Child Benefit or not.</p>

<p>You might be able to get Child Benefit for a period before the adoption - <a rel="external" href="https://directgov-online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CBO_Specific?dept-name=CBO&amp;sub-dept-name=General&amp;location=3&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk&amp;lang=eng" title="Email the Child Benefit Office">contact the Child Benefit Office</a> to find out.</p>

<p>If you foster a child, you’ll get Child Benefit if the local council isn’t paying anything towards the child’s accommodation or maintenance.</p>

<h2>Looking after someone else’s child</h2>

<p>You may be able to get Child Benefit if you’ve got an informal arrangement to look after a friend or relative’s child. </p>

<p>If your local council is paying towards the child’s accommodation or maintenance you might not qualify - <a rel="external" href="https://directgov-online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CBO_Specific?dept-name=CBO&amp;sub-dept-name=General&amp;location=3&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk&amp;lang=eng" title="Email the Child Benefit Office">contact the Child Benefit Office</a> to find out.</p>

<p>If you want to make a claim, you need to agree with the person who is currently getting Child Benefit (eg the parent) that you can make a claim instead - 2 people can’t get Child Benefit for the same child.</p>

<p>If you’re responsible for a child who has lost one or both of their parents, you may also be entitled to <a href="/guardians-allowance" title="Guardian's Allowance">Guardian’s Allowance</a>. </p>

<h2>Living abroad</h2>
<p>You could get Child Benefit if you’re a national of an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country or Switzerland, and work in the UK (or get certain UK benefits, eg State Pension).</p>

<p>There’s more information about <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childbenefit/start/who-qualifies/live-work-abroad.htm" title="Child Benefit if you're living or working abroad">Child Benefit if you’re living or working abroad</a> on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) website.</p>

  </header><ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Fill in a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/forms/ch2-online-stubb.htm" title="Child Benefit claim form" rel="external">Child Benefit claim form.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send it to the Child Benefit Office with your child’s original birth or adoption certificate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Child Benefit Office (Washington)
<br>Freepost
<br>NEA 10463
<br>PO Box 133

<br></p></div></div>

<p>The claim form is also available in Welsh.</p>

</div>

<p>Claim Child Benefit as soon as your child is born or comes to live with you.</p>

<p>Child Benefit can only be backdated for 3 months - make your claim as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you don’t have the birth or adoption certificate, you should still send in your claim form - send the certificate later on when you’ve got it.</p>

<p>You don’t need the birth or adoption certificate if you’ve claimed Child Benefit before and are making a new claim for the same child.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’ve lost the birth or adoption certificate you can <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate" title="order a new birth or adoption certificate">order a new one</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Claiming Child Benefit for someone else</h2>
<p>In certain circumstances you can <a href="/claim-child-benefit-behalf-someone-else" title="Claim Child Benefit on behalf of someone else">manage someone else’s Child Benefit claim.</a></p>


</article><article id="further-information"><header><h1>Part 5: Further information</h1>
  </header><h2>Child Benefit number</h2>
<p>You can <a href="/child-benefit-number" title="Finding your Child Benefit number">find your Child Benefit number</a> on any paperwork you have from the Child Benefit Office.</p>

<p>You should keep your paperwork until you stop getting Child Benefit.</p>

<h2>Other benefits</h2>

<p>Child Benefit doesn’t count as income for other benefits. </p>

<p>If you get Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit, the office paying you needs to know if you start or stop getting Child Benefit. This is so they can work out how much to pay you.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You might be able to get other benefits too, eg <a href="/child-tax-credit/overview" title="Child Tax Credit">Child Tax Credit</a> - use the <a href="/benefits-adviser" title="benefits adviser">benefits adviser tool</a> to find out what you could get.</p>
</div>

<h2>Child Benefit and your State Pension</h2>

<p>If your child is under 12 and you’re not working or don’t earn enough to pay National Insurance contributions, Child Benefit can help you qualify for <a href="/boost-state-pension/overview" title="National Insurance credits">National Insurance credits</a>.</p>

<p>These credits count towards your <a href="/state-pension" title="State Pension">State Pension</a>. They protect it by making sure you don’t have gaps in your National Insurance record.</p>

<h3>If you were getting Child Benefit before 6 April 2010</h3>

<p>If you were getting Child Benefit for a child under 16, you would have automatically qualified for Home Responsibilities Protection instead - this counts towards your State Pension in the same way.</p>

<p>If you were getting Child Benefit for a child under 6, you would have automatically built up entitlement to an extra pension through the Second State Pension.</p>

<h2>Changes of circumstances</h2>
<p>You must report any changes to your family life (eg getting married) or to your child’s life (eg leaving education) to the <a href="/report-changes-child-benefit" title="report a change of circumstances">Child Benefit Office</a>.</p>

<h2>Complaints and appeals</h2>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childbenefit/if-things-go-wrong/complaints-appeals/how-to-complain.htm" title="complain to the Child Benefit Office">complain to the Child Benefit Office</a> if you’re unhappy with the way you’ve been treated.</p>

<p>If you’re not happy with a decision the Child Benefit Office has made, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childbenefit/if-things-go-wrong/complaints-appeals/how-to-appeal.htm" title="appeal a Child Benefit decision">appeal.</a></p>
