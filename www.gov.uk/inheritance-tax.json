The trustee is the person who looks after the trust.\r\n\r\nIf you've got an inheritance or a gift from someone who has died you only owe Inheritance Tax if their estate is more than \u00a3325,000 and:\r\n\r\n- it says in the will that you should pay Inheritance Tax\r\n- or the deceased's estate can't pay it\r\n\r\n##Working out if Inheritance Tax is due on an estate\r\n\r\nIf you're the executor of an estate you need to work out if you need to pay Inheritance Tax. \r\n\r\nTo see if it's due, you:\r\n\r\n- add up the value of everything in the estate (including gifts made before the person died)\r\n- take away any debts, like bills and funeral expenses\r\n\r\nThere's detailed information to help you if you're [valuing the estate of someone who's died](/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died \"valuing the estate of someone who's died\").\r\n\r\n##Deadline for paying Inheritance Tax\r\n\r\nYou usually have to pay Inheritance Tax within 6 months of the person dying - after this, you have to pay [interest](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/iht-interest-rates.htm \"interest\"){:rel=\"external\"}. \r\n\r\nThere's more information on [Inheritance Tax deadlines](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/inheritancetax/paying-iht/payment-deadlines.htm \"Inheritance Tax deadlines\"){:rel=\"external\"} on the HMRC website.\r\n\r\n^Even if no Inheritance Tax is due, you still have to complete a ['Return of estate information' form](http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?formid=3307&record=hBFaNANqIOw \"Return of estate information form\"){:rel=\"external\"} if you're applying for [probate](/wills-probate-inheritance/applying-for-a-grant-of-representation \"applying for probate\").

This could be:\r\n\r\n- sole tenancy - you own 100% of the home\r\n- joint tenancy - you own an equal share of the home with one or more people \r\n- tenants in common - you own the home with one or more people but each share doesn't have to be equal\r\n\r\nIf you and your spouse or civil partner are joint tenants and one of you dies, the other automatically gets their share of the house. \r\n\r\nIf you own a home as tenants in common, you can pass your portion on to your children when you die and divide the property up between them and your partner. This can reduce the size of the estate for tax purposes.\r\n\r\n*[HMRC]:HM Revenue & Customs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","slug":"inheritance-tax-planning-passing-on-property","title":"Inheritance Tax planning - passing on property"}},{"table":{"body":"If someone leaves everything to their spouse or civil partner when they die and the partner has their permanent home in the UK, it's exempt from Inheritance Tax.  \r\n\r\nThis means their Inheritance Tax threshold hasn't been used and can be transferred to their partner's estate when they die, even if they remarry.\r\n\r\nSo, they could have an Inheritance Tax threshold of up to \u00a3650,000 - twice the usual threshold.\r\n\r\n##How the transfer works\r\n\r\nThe transfer happens when the second partner dies and is done by their executor or personal representative.
