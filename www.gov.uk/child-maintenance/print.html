  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Child maintenance is financial support that helps towards a child’s everyday living costs when the parents have separated.</p>

<p>It’s for children who are either:</p>

<ul>
<li>under 16</li>
  <li>16 to 19 and in full-time education (not higher than A-level or equivalent)</li>
</ul>
<p>The parent who doesn’t have day-to-day care of the child (the ‘paying parent’) pays child maintenance to the parent or person who does (the ‘receiving parent’). </p>

<p>The ‘receiving parent’ could be a grandparent or guardian as well as a parent. </p>

<p>You can <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself" title="arranging child maintenance yourself">arrange child maintenance yourself</a> or through the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) </li>
  <li>Child Maintenance Service</li>
</ul>
<p>These organisations are called ‘statutory child maintenance services’. They’ll work out how much should be paid, and they can also collect the payments for you.</p>

<p>When you <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency/how-to-apply" title="how to apply">apply for child maintenance</a>, you’ll be told which organisation will handle your case.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can use the <a href="/calculate-your-child-maintenance" title="child maintenance calculator">child maintenance calculator</a> to get an idea of what payments might be.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who can use a service</h2>

<p>You can apply if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>the parent the child lives with</li>
  <li>the parent the child doesn’t live with</li>
  <li>a grandparent or other guardian of the child</li>
  <li>a child living in Scotland</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who can’t use a service</h2>

<p>You can’t apply if the receiving parent or the child lives outside the UK. </p>

<p>If the paying parent lives abroad, the statutory services can only help <a href="/child-maintenance-if-one-parent-lives-abroad" title="child maintenance if one parent lives abroad">in certain circumstances</a>. </p>

<h2>What statutory child maintenance services can help with</h2>

<p>They can help you:</p>

<ul>
<li>find the other parent if you don’t know where they live</li>
  <li>sort out any <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency/disagreements-about-parentage" title="disagreements about parentage">disagreements about parentage</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a href="/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out" title="how child maintenance is worked out">work out</a> how much child maintenance should be paid</li>
  <li>arrange for the paying parent to pay child maintenance</li>
  <li>pass payments on to the receiving parent </li>
  <li>look at the payments again when <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency/changes-you-need-to-report" title="changes in parents' circumstances">changes in parents’ circumstances</a> are reported</li>

  </header><p>To apply to a statutory child maintenance service - the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) or the Child Maintenance Service - contact your <a rel="external" href="https://www2.dwp.gov.uk/csa/v2/en/contact/index.asp" title="contact your local CSA office">local <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> office.</a></p>

<p>They’ll tell you which service will manage your case.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The parent the child doesn’t live with is called the ‘paying parent’. The parent or carer they live with is called the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<h2>Information you need to supply</h2>

<p>You need to provide information about you and your family, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>your National Insurance number and bank account details</li>
  <li>details about the child you’re applying for - including the full names of their mother and father</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s more information about what you need to provide in the child maintenance application checklist.</p>

<h3>How your information is used</h3>

<p>Your information is used to set up and manage child maintenance payments, and sometimes to find the paying parent. </p>

<p>They won’t give out names and addresses unless ordered to by a court, but information might be shared with other government organisations, debt collection agencies or the courts.</p>

<p>If the services can’t get the information from either parent, they might ask other people or organisations, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>the paying parent’s employer</li>
  <li>government organisations like Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>prison services or local councils</li>
  <li>the paying parent’s bank or building society</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="/data-protection" title="information about the Data Protection Act">Data Protection Act</a> controls how your information is used. There’s also more information about how the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> uses and stores your information in the leaflet below.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re using the Child Maintenance Service, contact them for information about how they use your information - their contact details will be on any letters you’ve received.</p>
</div>

<h2>How long it takes</h2>

<p>You’ll usually get a response from the service managing your application within 12 weeks - sometimes it can take up to 26 weeks, eg if there’s a problem with contact details for the paying parent.</p>

<p>If the contact details for the paying parent aren’t known, the service will try to find them - but if they can’t, the receiving parent can’t open a case.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The first child maintenance payment is usually made within 6 weeks of making payment arrangements with the paying parent.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="how-to-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: How to pay</h1>
  </header><p>When you use a statutory child maintenance service - the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) or the Child Maintenance Service - child maintenance can be paid:</p>

<ul>
<li>by direct debit - the service managing your case will set this up</li>
  <li>directly from the paying parent’s earnings - the service sorts this out with their employer</li>
  <li>by standing order, direct from one account to another</li>
</ul>
<p>Payments are paid into the receiving parent’s bank account.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘paying parent’ is the parent the child doesn’t live with. The ‘receiving parent’ is the parent or carer they live with.</p>
</div>

<h2>Paying child maintenance directly</h2>

<p>When the service managing your case has worked out a child maintenance amount, you can make your own payment arrangements if you both agree. This is called:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintenance Direct if you’re using the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Direct Pay if you’re using the Child Maintenance Service</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to pay is by standing order - payments go direct from the paying parent’s  bank, building society or Post Office account into the receiving parent’s account. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you or the other parent don’t have a bank, building society or Post Office account and can’t open one, tell the service managing your case.</p>
</div>

<h2>When payments are made</h2>

<p>If you’re using a statutory child maintenance service to collect and pass on payments, they’ll arrange this based on when the paying parent is paid their wages, pension or benefits. </p>

<p>If you’re a paying parent and  having problems paying, contact either your <a rel="external" href="https://www2.dwp.gov.uk/csa/v2/en/contact/index.asp" title="contact the CSA">local <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> office</a> or the Child Maintenance Service (using the contact details on any  letters you’ve been sent).</p>

<h3>Collection and payment schedules</h3>

<p>If you’re the paying parent, the service managing your application will send you a ‘collection schedule’ - this tells you how much you need to pay and when.</p>

<p>If you’re the receiving parent, they’ll send you a ‘payment schedule’ - this tells you how much is due and when it’ll be collected.</p>

<p>There’s more information about how <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> collects and pays child maintenance in the leaflets below.</p>

<h2>Paying off child maintenance debt</h2>

<p>If you’re a paying parent and you’ve missed paying child maintenance you’ll usually be asked to pay the full amount you owe straight away. You can pay:</p>

<ul>
<li>with a credit or debit card</li>
  <li>through your bank</li>
</ul>
<p>In some circumstances, you might be able to agree with the service managing your application to pay the debt in instalments.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or the Child Maintenance Service can <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency/nonpayment-what-happens" title="non-payment and how it's dealt with">take action</a> if child maintenance isn’t being paid.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="nonpayment-what-happens"><header><h1>Part 4: Non-payment</h1>
  </header><p>The statutory child maintenance services - the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) and the Child Maintenance Service - will take action if child maintenance isn’t paid.</p>

<p>When a child maintenance payment is missed, the service you’re using will contact the parent the child doesn’t live with to:</p>

<ul>
<li>find out why they haven’t paid</li>
  <li>arrange for them to pay what they owe</li>
  <li>warn them about action that might be taken if they don’t pay</li>
</ul>
<p>The parent has a week to respond. If they don’t, the service you’re using can take action to get the child maintenance owed.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The parent the child doesn’t live with is called the ‘paying parent’. The parent or carer they live with is called the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<h2>What the statutory child maintenance services can do</h2>

<p>The service you’re using can take action immediately if the paying parent pays through them.</p>

<p>If the paying parent used a statutory service to calculate child maintenance but pays directly (Maintenance Direct through the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Direct Pay through the Child Maintenance Service), the receiving parent needs to ask the service to take action.</p>

<p>Statutory child maintenance services can get unpaid child maintenance in 3 different ways.</p>

<h3>Taking money from a paying parent’s earnings or benefits</h3>

<p>The service you’re using can tell the paying parent’s employer how much to take from their wages. The employer must then pass this to the service - if they don’t, the service can take them to court.</p>

<p>If the paying parent gets benefits, a State Pension or War Pension, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service can take the amount owed from these payments.</p>

<h3>Taking money from a bank or building society account</h3>

<p>The statutory services don’t need permission to do this. They can tell the bank or building society to take either:</p>

<ul>
<li>regular payments</li>
  <li>a one-off payment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Taking court action</h3>

<p>The statutory services can take a paying parent to court over unpaid child maintenance. Things the courts can do include:</p>

<ul>
<li>sending bailiffs (Sheriff Officers in Scotland) to a paying parent’s home to take and sell their belongings to get the child maintenance owed</li>
  <li>sending a paying parent to prison</li>
  <li>collecting money that’s owed to the paying parent by someone else and using this to pay the child maintenance owed</li>
  <li>forcing the sale of a property and using the money to pay the child maintenance owed</li>
</ul>
<p>If a paying parent tries to avoid paying by selling property or transferring it to someone else, the service managing their case can ask the courts to stop them.</p>

<p>The service can also ask the courts to reverse any sale or transfer that’s already happened.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If a statutory service takes action through the courts, the paying parent may have to pay the service’s legal costs as well as their own.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="disagreements-about-parentage"><header><h1>Part 5: Disagreements about parentage</h1>
  </header><p>If someone denies they’re the parent of a child, the statutory child maintenance services - the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) or the Child Maintenance Service - will:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask them for evidence proving they’re not the parent</li>
  <li>tell the other parent what’s happened and ask for evidence to prove parentage</li>
</ul>
<p>If the person named as the parent can’t give evidence proving they’re not, the service managing your case can:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask both parents to take a <a href="dna-tests" title="DNA tests">DNA test</a>
</li>
  <li>ask the courts to make a decision</li>
</ul>
<h2>Presumed parentage</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service can presume parentage if the person named as the parent:</p>

<ul>
<li>was married to the child’s mother at any time between the conception and birth of the child (unless the child was adopted)</li>
  <li>is named on the child’s birth certificate (unless the child was adopted)</li>
  <li>has taken a DNA test that shows they’re the parent</li>
  <li>has legally adopted the child</li>
  <li>is named in a court order as the parent when the child was born to a surrogate mother</li>
</ul>
<p>If a statutory child maintenance service presumes parentage it will work out a child maintenance amount. The person named as the parent has to pay this until they can prove that they’re not the child’s parent.</p>

<h2>Paying child maintenance during a disagreement</h2>

<p>If the child maintenance amount has already been worked out, the person named as the parent has to pay until they can provide evidence that they’re not.</p>

<p>If the amount hasn’t been worked out, the service managing the case won’t work it out or ask for payment until the disagreement has been sorted out. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the person is found to be the parent, the amount of child maintenance they have to pay will be back-dated.</p>
</div>

<h2>If the named person proves they’re not the parent</h2>

<p>If this happens the service managing the case may:</p>

<ul>
<li>refund any payments made after the date they first denied they were the parent, or offset the amount against maintenance for another child</li>
  <li>refund the cost of any DNA tests arranged through the service</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service may also ask the other parent to pay back any child maintenance. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Refunds depend on the circumstances of each case.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="dna-tests"><header><h1>Part 6: DNA tests</h1>
  </header><p>The Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) and the Child Maintenance Service (the ‘statutory child maintenance services’) can use DNA testing to sort out <a href="disagreements-about-parentage" title="disagreements about parentage">disagreements about parentage</a>. </p>

<p>This either:</p>

<ul>
<li>proves 100% that someone isn’t a child’s parent</li>
  <li>shows a 99.9% probability that they are a child’s parent</li>
</ul>
<p>The person named as the parent and the parent the child lives with need to agree to the tests. If the child is 16 or over, they can give their own permission.</p>

<h2>Arranging a test</h2>

<p>This can be done either through:</p>

<ul>
<li>the DNA testing company used by the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service</li>
  <li>a private testing company</li>
</ul>
<p>The statutory child maintenance services only accept the results of a private test if:</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s been done by <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/paternity-testing/paternity-test" title="approved DNA testing companies">an approved company</a>
</li>
  <li>security arrangements meet acceptable standards</li>
  <li>everyone involved is satisfied that the test was done properly</li>
  <li>the test was based on samples from the person named as the parent, the parent the child lives with and the child</li>
</ul>
<p>DNA testing involves the following steps:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The DNA testing company sends an information pack to the parent the child lives with and the person named as the parent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person named as the parent chooses a doctor to do the test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The doctor gets a testing kit from the testing company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The doctor takes a sample (either from the mouth, or a blood sample).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The doctor sends the samples to the testing company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The testing company sends the results to the person named as the parent, the parent the child lives with and the service managing the case - they might also be given to a court as evidence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Test fees</h2>

<p>When using the Child Support Agency the person named as the parent has to pay the DNA test fee, which is £252. If they pay when they return their appointment form, they can pay a discounted rate of £187.20.</p>

<p>When using the Child Maintenance Service test fees may vary depending on how may children are involved. </p>

<p>In some circumstances the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service will pay the test fee if the person named as the parent can’t afford to. But if they’re found to be the parent, they’ll have to pay it back.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Test fees can change - contact the service managing your  case to check.</p>
</div>

<h2>After the test</h2>

<p>If the test proves the person is the parent of the child, the service managing the case will work out how much their payments should be. </p>

<p>Payments will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>child maintenance</li>
  <li>the cost of the DNA test</li>
</ul>
<p>If the test proves the person isn’t the parent, the statutory child maintenance service may:</p>

<ul>
<li>refund the cost of the test (if it was done through the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service)</li>
  <li>refund any child maintenance payments made after parentage was denied</li>
</ul>
<p>The statutory services don’t pay back any child maintenance that was paid before the person denied they were the parent of the child.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Refunds depend on the circumstances of each case.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="changes-you-need-to-report"><header><h1>Part 7: Changes you need to report</h1>
  </header><p>When you use a statutory child maintenance service - the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) or the Child Maintenance Service - there are some changes you have to tell them about by law.</p>

<p>What you have to report depends on whether you’re the parent or person the child lives with (the ‘receiving parent’) or the parent the child doesn’t live with (the ‘paying parent’).</p>

<h2>If you’re the paying parent</h2>

<p>You must tell the service managing your case if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>move house (you must give your new address within 7 days of the moving date)</li>
  <li>start or stop getting benefits</li>
  <li>change your phone number (including mobile number) </li>
  <li>start or stop working for an employer</li>
  <li>start or stop being self-employed</li>
  <li>become unemployed</li>
  <li>have a rise in your gross weekly income of 25% or more (but only if you use the Child Maintenance Service)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you pay child maintenance through deductions in your earnings and you leave your job, you must also tell the service:</p>

<ul>
<li>the name and address of your new employer (if any)</li>
  <li>how much you expect to earn</li>
  <li>your new payroll number (if any)</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you’re the receiving parent</h2>

<p>You must tell the service managing your case if there’s a change to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of children living with you that you get child maintenance for</li>
  <li>the number of nights a child regularly stays overnight with the paying parent</li>
  <li>the number of children that you or your partner get child benefit for</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also tell the service if:</p>

<ul>
<li>a child you get child maintenance for leaves full-time education (below A-level)</li>
  <li>you or any of the children you get child maintenance for no longer live in the UK</li>
  <li>you find out that the paying parent is coming off benefits</li>
  <li>you’re moving house or know that the other parent is</li>
  <li>your phone number (including mobile number) changes</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Either parent should tell the service managing their case if the paying parent’s income changes.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you don’t give the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service the right information</h2>

<p>You could be taken to court and fined up to £1,000 if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>don’t give the service managing your case the information it needs</li>
  <li>give the service information that you know is false</li>
</ul>
<p>This applies to any person or organisation who, by law, must give the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service information, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>employers</li>
  <li>accountants</li>
  <li>either parent</li>
</ul>
<h2>When changes could affect your payments</h2>

<p>Child maintenance payments could be affected by changes to:</p>

<ul>
<li>income </li>
  <li>family circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re using a statutory child maintenance service, changes in your circumstances may mean a change to the amount of child maintenance you pay or receive.</p>

<p>Read the information about <a href="/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/child-maintenance-before-march-2003" title="how child maintenance is worked out">how child maintenance is worked out</a> to find out about the different rules. </p>


</article><article id="if-the-child-support-agency-or-child-maintenance-service-makes-a-mistake"><header><h1>Part 8: If the Child Support Agency or Child Maintenance Service makes a mistake</h1>
  </header><p>If a statutory child maintenance service - Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) or Child Maintenance Service - makes a mistake in your child maintenance case, this is called ‘maladministration’. </p>

<p>You can sometimes get compensation called ‘special payments’ if this happens. If you’re using the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>, read the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> leaflet on special payments for more information.</p>

</div>

<p>If you’re using the Child Maintenance Service and you think a mistake has been made, contact the Child Maintenance Service directly - their contact details will be on any letters they’ve sent you.</p>

<h2>Advance payments of child maintenance</h2>

<p>Sometimes maladministration means child maintenance isn’t collected on time. This leads to a delay in the receiving parent getting child maintenance. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘receiving parent’ is the parent or carer the child lives with. The ‘paying parent’ is the parent they don’t live with.</p>
</div>

<p>If there’s a delay, the service managing your case might make an advance payment to the receiving parent whilst it collects payment from the paying parent.</p>

<h3>When statutory child maintenance services make advance payments</h3>

<p>This only happens when:</p>

<ul>
<li>there’s clear evidence that maladministration caused the delay</li>
  <li>there’s clear evidence that if maladministration hadn’t happened, the paying parent would have paid or been made to pay</li>
  <li>the amount owed because of maladministration is over £100</li>
  <li>it would take more than 26 weeks for the paying parent to pay the child maintenance that wasn’t collected because of maladministration</li>
  <li>the delay was longer than the time it normally takes to process payments</li>
</ul>
<p>The receiving parent must:</p>

<ul>
<li>have been made to wait longer than normal for their child maintenance </li>
  <li>have shown an interest in progressing their case during the period of the delay, contacting the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service at least every 3 months</li>
  <li>agree that the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service can keep the delayed payments once they have been collected from the paying parent</li>
  <li>agree to refund any payments made directly to them by the paying parent instead of their delayed payments</li>
</ul>
<p>The paying parent must:</p>

<ul>
<li>have been paying up until the point of maladministration</li>
  <li>be making regular payments when an application for an advance payment is made</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
