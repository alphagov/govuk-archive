<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When you drive a goods vehicle from one country to another, you must ensure that certain documents are on board. Some will be the same as those you use in the UK, eg the vehicle’s registration papers, and others may be specific to your journey or reason for travel, eg the International Motor Insurance Certificate, a Dangerous Goods Note or Green Card.</p>

<p>This guide provides information about the documents drivers will need to ensure that their vehicle is legally able to cross international borders.</p>

<h2 id="vehicle-registration-documents">Vehicle registration documents</h2>

<p>If you take a UK-registered vehicle out of the country for less than 12 months, you must take documentation to show that you are authorised to possess the vehicle. This means you must carry the original Vehicle Registration Document (<abbr title="Vehicle Registration Document">VRD</abbr>) form V5 or Vehicle Registration Certificate (V5C) with you. If you have not received the V5C certificate, or the original has been lost, stolen or defaced, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@motor/documents/digitalasset/dg_067819.pdf">download the application for a vehicle registration certificate from the Directgov website (PDF, 226K)</a>.</p>

<p>If you take your vehicle out of the UK for more than 12 months (permanent export), you must notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>) by completing Section C of the <abbr title="Vehicle Registration Document">VRD</abbr> showing the date you intend to export. You should then return the <abbr title="Vehicle Registration Document">VRD</abbr> to your local <abbr title="Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> office. The <abbr title="Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will send you a certificate of permanent export (V561) as confirmation of your vehicle’s registration.</p>

<p>If you have a V5C, you must complete and return the purple section (V5C/4). It is important that you take your registration certificate with you as you may have to hand it to the relevant authority when the vehicle is registered abroad.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/BuyingAndSellingAVehicle/ImportingAndExportingAVehicle/DG_4022582">Read about taking a vehicle out of the UK permanently or temporarily on the Directgov website</a>.</p>

<p>If your vehicle is hired or leased, the supplier company is unlikely to release the original <abbr title="Vehicle Registration Document">VRD</abbr> to you. The alternative is to apply for a Vehicle on Hire Certificate (VE103), which you can carry instead. This certificate is authenticated proof of permission from the owner to take the vehicle abroad. A Vehicle on Hire Certificate is valid for one year and you can buy one from motoring organisations such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automobile Association (AA)</li>
  <li>British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA)</li>
  <li>Fleet Transport Association</li>
  <li>Green Flag</li>
  <li>Royal Automobile Club (RAC)</li>
  <li>Road Haulage Association</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vehicle-insurance-documents">Vehicle insurance documents</h2>

<p>There are three levels of general motor vehicle insurance in the UK:</p>

<ul>
<li>third party</li>
  <li>third party fire and theft</li>
  <li>fully comprehensive</li>
</ul>
<p>The level of your insurance cover determines the compensation available to you or other people for injury, loss or damage resulting from an accident.</p>

<p>Third party cover is the basic EU legal requirement. This ensures that compensation for injury to other people, including your passengers, damage to or loss of other peoples’ property resulting from an accident caused by you is available. None of the costs incurred by you as the result of an accident are covered. Most insurers offer extra levels of cover beyond the basic legal requirement.</p>

<p>Third party, fire and theft provides the same cover as third party but also includes fire damage and theft of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Fully comprehensive provides the same cover as third party, fire and theft and additionally covers any damage to your vehicle. Most insurers include extra levels of cover to this category, such as roadside recovery schemes, vehicle breakdown repairs and certain legal expenses.</p>

<p>Every motor insurance policy issued in the EU must provide the minimum insurance cover required by law in any other EU country. In many countries, even those within the EU where a UK insurance certificate is acceptable, you may be asked to produce a Green Card. The Green Card is not an insurance cover. It simply provides proof, in those countries where the Green Card is valid, that the minimum third party liability cover required by law in the visited country is in force.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.mib.org.uk/Customer+Services/en/General+Cross+Border+Information/FAQs+Green+Card.htm">find the countries that do and don’t require a Green Card on the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (<abbr title="Motor Insurers' Bureau">MIB</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>If your insurers are unable to issue a Green Card, <a rel="external" href="http://www.mib.org.uk/Customer+Services/en/General+Cross+Border+Information/FAQs+Green+Card.htm">find alternative suppliers on the <abbr title="Motor Insurers' Bureau">MIB</abbr> website</a>. The <abbr title="Motor Insurers' Bureau">MIB</abbr> operates the Green Card system in the UK.</p>

<h3 id="insurance-for-goods-in-transit">Insurance for goods in transit</h3>

<p>In some countries, you may need to produce a certificate of insurance for the goods carried to avoid paying a premium. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-goods-by-road">moving goods by road</a>.</p>

<p>It is also important to ensure that the risk of goods being damaged, delayed, perished, lost or stolen in transit is properly managed. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transport-insurance-for-international-trade">transport insurance</a>.</p>

<h2 id="goods-vehicle-operators-licence">Goods vehicle operator’s licence</h2>

<p>You must have the appropriate operator’s licence to transport goods for commercial purposes in heavy goods vehicles. They are available in three formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>restricted</li>
  <li>standard national</li>
  <li>standard international</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard international licence allows you to carry goods both in the UK and on international journeys. The licence comes into force once the fee has been paid and the licence documents are issued. Providing the annual fee is paid and there are no infringements, the licence lasts indefinitely. Identity discs are also issued and must be displayed in each specified motor vehicle. The identity discs show the:</p>

<ul>
<li>operator’s name</li>
  <li>vehicle registration mark</li>
  <li>operator’s licence number</li>
  <li>disc expiry date</li>
  <li>type of licence</li>
</ul>
<p>Operators and hauliers who are issued with international licences also receive EU Community Authorisations. A valid, certified blue copy is required for all hire or reward operations in or through EU countries. They have replaced the need for community permits, bilateral permits between member states and permits for transit traffic through the EU. They do not replace permits for travel to or through non-EU countries where these are still required.</p>

<p>The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) ‘Guide for Operators’ provides detailed information on all aspects of goods vehicle operator licensing. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/economic-operator-registration-and-identification-eori-scheme">Download <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s guide to goods vehicle operator licensing (PDF, 4.41MB)</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> is the authority which deals with operator licensing applications.

<h2 id="vehicle-tax-and-nationality-signs">Vehicle tax and nationality signs</h2>

<p>International traders who use road transport for cross-border trade need to be aware that the rules on vehicle tax vary from country to country.</p>

<p>UK registered goods vehicles are exempt from taxes on ‘circulation or possession’ - similar to UK vehicle tax - in those countries with which the UK has a bilateral agreement. Apart from such exemptions, goods vehicles are subject to the vehicle taxation system of any country through which they travel. The amount of tax you have to pay may vary from time to time and from country to country.</p>

<p>Presently, the following countries levy charges at varying levels on visiting foreign vehicles using their roads - Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Jordan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the bilateral agreements in force between the UK and other countries in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-authorisations-and-permits-for-road-haulage">international authorisations and permits for road haulage</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/OwningAVehicle/HowToTaxYourVehicle/DG_069677">find information on taxing a heavy goods vehicle on the Directgov website</a>.

<h3 id="nationality-sign-or-gb-sticker">Nationality sign or GB sticker</h3>

<p>All vehicles registered in the UK must display the international registration letters GB on the rear of the vehicle when taken temporarily abroad.</p>

<p>UK registered vehicles displaying Euro-plates (a circle of 12 stars above the national identifier on a blue background) no longer need to fix a GB sticker to the rear of their vehicle when driving in EU countries. In non-EU countries, a GB sticker must still be displayed on the rear of UK-registered motor vehicles, caravans or trailers.</p>

<p>Most motoring organisations and many tour operators will supply GB stickers.</p>

<p>In addition to the Euro symbol or GB sticker, drivers and keepers of vehicles registered in Great Britain are also permitted to voluntarily display national flags and certain identifiers on their number plates.</p>
