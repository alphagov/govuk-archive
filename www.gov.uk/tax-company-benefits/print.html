  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employee, you pay tax on company benefits like cars, accommodation and loans. The amount of tax you pay depends on the value of the benefits that you get.</p>

<p>Your employer takes the tax you owe from your wages.</p>

<p>You’ll always pay tax on benefits from your job if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re a company director</li>
  <li>you earn £8,500 a year or more (including the value of the benefits)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some company benefits can be tax-free, eg childcare and canteen meals.</p>


</article><article id="tax-on-company-cars"><header><h1>Part 2: Tax on company cars</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You pay tax on the <strong>value</strong> of the car and fuel to you.</p>
</div>

<p>Your company car’s value depends on things like how much it would cost to buy and the type of fuel it uses. Its value is reduced if you have the car part-time or you pay something towards its cost.</p>

<p>If your employer pays for fuel you use personally and not for your job, you’ll pay tax on this separately.</p>

<p>Use the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/calcs/cars.htm" title="Company car fuel benefit calculator">company car fuel benefit calculator</a> on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs website.</p>

<h2>Loans</h2>
<p>You’ll pay tax on low-interest or interest-free loans from your employer if they’re worth £5,000 or more.</p>

<p>You pay tax on the difference between the interest rate you pay to your employer and the official rate of interest set by the Bank of England.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You may pay tax if your employer lends money to one of your relatives.</p>

</div>

<h2>Living accommodation</h2>
<p>If you (or one of your relatives) is living in accommodation provided by your employer you may pay tax. </p>

<p>How the tax is worked out depends on whether the accommodation cost more than £75,000.</p>

<p>You may not pay tax if you get the accommodation so you can do your job, or do your job better (eg agricultural workers living on farms).</p>

<h2>Medical insurance</h2>
<p>You usually pay tax on the cost of the insurance premiums if your employer pays for your medical insurance.</p>

<p>You can get some tax-free health benefits from your employer, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>medical insurance when you’re working abroad</li>
  <li>annual check-ups </li>
</ul>

</div>

</article><article id="taxfree-company-benefits"><header><h1>Part 4: Tax-free company benefits</h1>
  </header><p>You can get some company benefits tax-free, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>meals in a staff canteen </li>
  <li>hot drinks and water at work</li>
  <li>a mobile phone </li>
  <li>workplace parking </li>
  <li>Christmas parties</li>
  <li>childcare</li>
</ul></article><article id="national-insurance-on-company-benefits"><header><h1>Part 5: National Insurance on company benefits</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t usually have to pay National Insurance on benefits you get from your job if they’re not paid in cash. </p>

<p>Your employer will pay National Insurance contributions on them instead.</p>

<p>But if the benefits you get are cash or treated like cash your employer will take extra National Insurance from your wages. </p>

<p>For example, if your employer gives you a gift that you could sell instead of keep, you will pay National Insurance on the value of the the gift if you sold it.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Check if your employeer needs to take National Insurance contributions for <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/exb/a-z/a/index.htm" title="A-Z of taxable company benefits" rel="external">your type of company benefit.</a></p>
</div>

</article><article id="paperwork-and-reporting-changes-to-your-company-benefits"><header><h1>Part 6: Paperwork and reporting changes to your company benefits</h1>
  </header><p>At the end of each tax year, your employer will give you details of the company benefits that they’ve told HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) about. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must keep these details for two years after the tax year they relate to.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you start or stop getting benefits from work</h2>
