  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>When you travel to the UK from abroad, you can bring in goods without having to pay UK duty or tax, as long as they are for your own use.</p>

<p>The amount of goods you can bring in depends on where you’re travelling from:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you’re coming from a country in the <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm" title="European Union">European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>),</a> you can bring in an unlimited amount of most goods for your own use without paying tax or duty</li>
  <li>if you’re coming from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> you can only bring in a certain amount without paying - this is your duty-free allowance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of tax and duty</h2>

<p>If you go over the amount you’re allowed to bring in tax-free, there are 3 types of tax or duty you might have to pay.</p>

<h3>Excise Duty</h3>

<p>You pay this on goods like alcohol and tobacco, and:</p>

<ul>
<li>when you buy these in the UK, it’s included in the price </li>
  <li>if you’re travelling to the UK from another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country, you don’t have to pay it</li>
  <li>if you’re travelling from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you only pay if you go over your duty-free allowance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Customs Duty</h3>

<p>You pay this on goods imported from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and:</p>

<ul>
<li>you don’t have to pay it if you’re travelling from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>if you’re travelling from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you only have to pay it if you go over your duty-free allowance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Import <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you’re bringing goods into the UK from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> there’s no extra <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> to pay. If you’re bringing goods to the UK from a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country you have to pay Import <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> if you go over your allowance.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/reportingfraud/help.htm" title="report excise and customs fraud">report customs and excise fraud</a> to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr></p>
</div>


</article><article id="arrivals-from-eu-countries"><header><h1>Part 2: Arrivals from EU countries</h1>
  </header><p>When you’re bringing in goods you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>transport them yourself</li>
  <li>make sure they’re for your own use or a gift</li>
  <li>have paid tax and duty in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country where you bought them</li>
</ul>
<p>You can bring in motor fuel in your vehicle’s tank and reserve fuel for that vehicle in an appropriate container without paying duty.</p>

<h2>Customs checks</h2>

<p>If a customs officer thinks you might be bringing in goods to sell, they might stop you to make checks and ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>the type and quantity of goods you’ve bought</li>
  <li>why you bought them</li>
  <li>how you paid for them</li>
  <li>how often you travel</li>
  <li>how much your normally smoke or drink</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are no limits to the alcohol and tobacco you can bring in from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries, you’re more likely to be asked questions if you have more than the amounts below.</p>

<h2>Declaring goods to customs</h2>

<p>You have to tell customs about any <a href="/duty-free-goods/banned-and-restricted-goods" title="Restricted goods">restricted goods</a> and show them the relevant paper work, eg licences, permits, that allow you to bring these into the UK. To do this you use the red channel or the red-point phone. The customs officer will tell you if any tax or duty is owed and how much you have to pay. </p>

<p>If you don’t have the correct paper work or are bringing in <a href="/duty-free-goods/banned-and-restricted-goods" title="Banned goods">banned goods</a>, customs will seize these immediately. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s more information about <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/arriving/customs-channels.htm" title="going through customs" rel="external">going through customs</a> on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) website.</p>

</article><article id="arrivals-from-outside-the-eu"><header><h1>Part 3: Arrivals from outside the EU</h1>
  </header><p>When you travel to the UK from outside the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>), you can bring in a certain amount of duty and tax free goods for your own use. This is known as an ‘allowance’. If you go over your allowance you may have to pay duty and/or tax. </p>

<p>If you’re under 17 you’re not entitled to tax and duty free allowances. </p>

<p>When you’re bringing in goods you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>transport them yourself </li>
  <li>keep them for your own use or give them as a gift </li>
</ul>
<h2>Alcohol allowances</h2>

<p>You can bring in either of the following (but not both):</p>

<ul>
<li>1 litre of spirits or strong liqueurs (over 22% alcohol)</li>
  <li>2 litres of fortified wine (eg port, sherry), sparkling wine or any other alcoholic drink that’s less than 22% alcohol</li>
</ul>
<p>Or you can combine these allowances - so you could bring in 1 litre of fortified wine and half a litre of spirits (both half of your allowance).</p>

<p>You can also bring in both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>16 litres of beer</li>
  <li>4 litres of still wine</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tobacco allowances</h2>

<p>You can bring in one from the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>200 cigarettes</li>
  <li>100 cigarillos</li>
  <li>50 cigars</li>
  <li>250g tobacco</li>
</ul>
<p>Or you can combine these allowances - so you could bring in 100 cigarettes and 25 cigars (both half of your allowance). </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You cannot combine your alcohol and tobacco allowances.</p>
</div>

<h2>Other goods</h2>

<p>You can bring in goods worth up to £390 duty-free. If you arrive by private plane or boat, you can only bring in goods worth up to £270 duty-free. </p>

<p>If you bring in any single item worth more than your allowance you have to pay tax/duty on the full item value, not just the value above the allowance. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can’t group individual allowances together to bring in an item worth more than the limit.</p>
</div>

<h2>Declaring goods to customs</h2>

<p>You have to speak to customs when entering the UK from non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you exceed your allowances</li>
  <li>the goods are for commercial use</li>
  <li>you have 10,000 euros or more (or its equivalent) in cash</li>
  <li>you think you may have banned or restricted goods</li>
</ul>
<h2>How much you have to pay</h2>

<p>If you exceed your allowances or don’t meet the conditions you might have to pay:</p>

<ul>
<li>Customs Duty</li>
  <li>Excise Duty </li>
  <li>Import <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> </li>
</ul>
<h3>Customs Duty rates</h3>

<p>Customs Duty is waived if you owe less than £9. Otherwise:</p>

<ul>
<li>it only applies on goods above the £270 or £390 allowance (whichever is appropriate)</li>
  <li>over this allowance and up to £630 the rate is 2.5%</li>
  <li>over £630, the rate depends on the type of goods - check by calling the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, Customs and Excise Helpline:</li>
</ul>

</h3>
