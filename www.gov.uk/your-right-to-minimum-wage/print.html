</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Most workers in the UK over <a href="/know-when-you-can-leave-school" title="school leaving age">school leaving age</a> are legally entitled to be paid at least the National Minimum Wage - a minimum amount per hour.</p>

<p>It makes no difference:</p>

<ul>
<li>where you work in the UK  </li>
  <li>how you’re paid  </li>
  <li>how many workers your employer has</li>
  <li>if you work full time, part time or any other working pattern</li>
</ul>
<p>All employers have to pay the National Minimum Wage if you’re entitled to it - if they don’t, they’re breaking the law.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can check the <a href="/national-minimum-wage-rates" title="National Minimum Wage rates">National Minimum Wage rates</a> online.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="workers-entitled-to-the-minimum-wage"><header><h1>Part 2: Workers entitled to the minimum wage</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re one of the following, you should get the minimum wage:</p>

<ul>
<li>agency worker  </li>
  <li>apprentice - apprentice rate, or higher, depending on your age and if you’re still in the first year of your apprenticeship  </li>
  <li>trainee or a worker on a period of probation  </li>
  <li>doing work experience - this can also be unpaid   </li>
  <li>piece worker - paid by the number of items you produce or tasks you perform  </li>
  <li>commission worker - paid completely or partly by results    </li>
  <li>homeworker - unless you’re running your own business     </li>

  <li>seafarer or offshore worker   </li>
  <li>temporarily working outside the UK - but usually working in the UK </li>

</ul>
<h2>Agreeing to be paid at a lower rate</h2>

<p>You’re entitled to the minimum wage even if you sign a contract agreeing to be paid at a lower rate. </p>

<p>This is regardless whether you sign of your own free will or because your employer makes you. The contract is not legally binding and you must still be paid the proper rate.</p>

</article><article id="workers-not-entitled-to-the-minimum-wage"><header><h1>Part 3: Workers not entitled to the minimum wage</h1>
  </header><p>You’re not entitled to the minimum wage if you’re any of the following:</p>

  <li>voluntary worker - you have a contract and work for a charity or voluntary organisation, only getting limited expenses   </li>
  <li>student on work experience - which doesn’t last longer than a year and is part of a higher or further education course    </li>

  <li>on a government employment programme  </li>
  <li>on certain European programmes (eg Leonardo da Vinci, Youth in Action, Erasmus and Comenius)</li>

  <li>company director    </li>
</ul></article><article id="how-to-check-your-pay"><header><h1>Part 4: How to check your pay</h1>
  </header><p>To find out if you are getting the minimum wage you need to know <a href="what-pay-counts-" title="what pay counts">what pay counts</a> and <a href="what-pay-doesnt-count" title="what pay doesn't count">what pay doesn’t count</a>.</p>

<p>You also need to know which hours you’re entitled to be paid for. </p>

<h2>Pay reference period</h2>

<p>Your average hourly pay has to be at least the minimum wage, worked out over a period called the ‘pay reference period’.</p>

<p>This is usually the period of time that you’re actually paid for. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re paid weekly, your pay reference period is 1 week - if you’re paid monthly, it’s 1 month.</p>
</div>

<p>You must be paid, on average, at least the minimum wage during each pay reference period.</p>

<p>The pay reference period can’t be longer than a month. If your employer pays you at longer intervals (eg quarterly) you must still get the minimum wage, on average, each month every quarter.</p>

</article><article id="what-pay-counts-"><header><h1>Part 5: What pay counts </h1>
  </header><p>National Minimum Wage pay is calculated using your gross pay - this is what you get before tax and <a href="/national-insurance" title="National Insurance">National Insurance</a> have been taken off.</p>

<p>Your gross pay includes your basic pay for the work you have done and other types of pay which count towards the minimum wage, including: </p>

<ul>
<li>sales commission</li>
  <li>performance-related pay</li>
  <li>other payments based on how well you do your job</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-pay-doesnt-count"><header><h1>Part 6: What pay doesn't count</h1>
  </header><p>Some payments don’t count towards minimum wage pay. Deduct these from your total pay before working out if you’re getting the minimum wage.</p>

<p>Payments you should not include:</p>

<ul>
<li>loans   </li>
  <li>advances of wages   </li>
  <li>pension payments   </li>
  <li>retirement lump sums   </li>
  <li>redundancy payments   </li>
  <li>rewards under staff suggestion schemes    </li>
  <li>any premium element (anything you’re paid on top of your basic pay) for working at special times, eg overtime or on bank holidays   </li>
  <li>allowances on top of your basic pay, like for working unsocial hours, in a particular area (eg London weighting), in dangerous conditions, on call, or performing special duties over and above your normal ones   </li>
  <li>tax-free payments for travelling expenses  </li>
  <li>tips, gratuities, service charges and cover charges   </li>
</ul></article><article id="when-your-employer-provides-accommodation"><header><h1>Part 7: When your employer provides accommodation</h1>
  </header><p>If your employer provides you with accommodation, they can count some of its value towards your National Minimum Wage pay. This is called the ‘accommodation offset’. </p>

<p>The maximum amount your employer can count towards minimum wage pay as an accommodation offset is:</p>

<ul>
<li>£4.73 a day   </li>
  <li>£33.11 a week  </li>
</ul>
<p>It makes no difference whether:</p>

<ul>
<li>your employer takes rent out of your wages </li>
  <li>you have to pay rent to your employer after getting your wages </li>
  <li>your employer provides the accommodation as part of a package</li>
</ul></article><article id="work-experience-and-internships-paid-or-unpaid"><header><h1>Part 8: Work experience and internships - paid or unpaid?</h1>
  </header><p>Work experience and internships:</p>

<ul>
<li>can be paid or unpaid, depending on the arrangements you have with your employer  </li>
  <li>are usually for a limited period of time    </li>
</ul>
<p>The term ‘intern’ has no legal status.</p>

<h2>Getting the minimum wage during work experience</h2>
<p>If you’re doing work experience your entitlement to the minimum wage depends on the arrangements you’re working under.</p>

<p>One of the following categories will apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re a worker and are eligible for the minimum wage  </li>
  <li>you’re not a worker and therefore not eligible for the minimum wage</li>
  <li>you’re a worker, but the law says you’re exempt and therefore not eligible for minimum wage </li>
</ul>
<h3>Work experience - exempt workers</h3>

<p>Almost all workers in the UK are entitled to the minimum wage. However, you’re not entitled to the minimum wage when you are doing work experience and are:</p>

<ul>
<li>a student doing work experience as part of a course  </li>
  <li>of compulsory school age (5-16)</li>
  <li>doing voluntary work</li>
  <li>on a government or European programme</li>
  <li>work shadowing</li>
  <li>a volunteer  </li>
</ul>
<p>You’re a volunteer if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you work with no entitlement to financial reward or benefit, except out-of-pocket expenses   </li>
  <li>you don’t have to turn up for work if you don’t want to (even if people expect you to or you generally work to a regular pattern)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Job titles</h2>

<p>Entitlement to the minimum wage doesn’t depend on your job title. For example, you could still be entitled regardless of:</p>

<ul>
<li>being called a work experience trainee, an unpaid intern or a volunteer  </li>
  <li>having your role in the business described as a placement or internship, or unpaid work      </li>
</ul>
<h2>Record keeping</h2>

<p>Keep records of agreements you make with your employer, the tasks you are asked to perform and the hours you work. </p>

</article><article id="if-you-think-youre-not-being-paid-the-minimum-wage"><header><h1>Part 9: If you think you're not being paid the minimum wage</h1>
  </header><p>If you think you have been underpaid, talk to your employer.</p>

<h2>Checking your employer’s pay records</h2>

<p>If you’re still not satisfied you can check your employer’s pay records or ask HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) to investigate for you.</p>

<p>You must ask your employer in writing first. They must show you the records in 14 days.</p>

<p>You can take someone else with you to look at the records, as long as your written request says that someone will be coming with you. Your employer has no say in who you take along. </p>

<p>You can copy the records if you want to.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you don’t want to speak to your employer, you can contact the Pay and Work Rights Helpline and ask for help.</p>
</div>

<p>You can send them a <a rel="external" href="https://payandworkrights.direct.gov.uk/" title="Pay and Work Rights general enquiry form">general enquiry</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://payandworkrights.direct.gov.uk/complaints/" title="Pay and Work Rights complaint form">make a complaint</a> online.</p>

<p>Or you can call:</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Pay and Work Rights Helpline</strong> </p>

<p>0800 917 2368</p>
</div>

<p>Your complaint can be investigated and your employer could be ordered to pay you any back pay you are owed (‘arrears’). </p>
