  </header><p>Statutory Adoption Pay is a weekly payment you get from your employer to help take time off work when you adopt a child.</p>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>Statutory Adoption Pay is £135.45 or 90% of your average weekly earnings before tax (whichever is lower). </p>

<p>Statutory Adoption Pay is payable for 39 weeks.</p>

<p>Your employer will pay Statutory Adoption Pay to you in the same way and at the same time as your normal wages.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Statutory Adoption Pay is treated as normal pay, so your employer will deduct tax and National Insurance as usual.</p>

  </header><p>To get Statutory Adoption Pay you must have been:</p>

<ul>
