  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer might monitor you at work. This could be done in various ways, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>CCTV</li>
  <li>drug testing</li>
  <li>bag searches</li>
  <li>checking your emails or the websites you look at</li>
</ul>
<p>Data protection law covers any monitoring that involves taking data, images or drug testing.</p>

<p>If you’re unhappy about being monitored, check your staff handbook or contract to see if your employer’s allowed to do this. </p>

<p>If they’re not, you might be able to resign and claim unfair (‘constructive’) dismissal. But this is a last resort - you should try to sort the problem out first - read the advice to help you <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute" title="solve a workplace dispute">solve a workplace dispute</a>.</p>

<h2>Searches</h2>

<p>Your employer should have a written policy on searching. Searches should respect privacy, be done by a member of the same sex and with a witness present.</p>

<p>If a search or drug test is badly handled you might have a claim for discrimination, assault or false imprisonment. </p>

</article><article id="drug-testing"><header><h1>Part 2: Drug testing</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer has to have your consent if they want to test for drugs. Usually this is when they have a full contractual health and safety policy, which should be in your contract or staff handbook.</p>

<p>Your employer should:</p>

<ul>
<li>limit testing to employees that need to be tested</li>
  <li>ensure the tests are random</li>
  <li>not single out particular employees for testing unless this is justified by the nature of their jobs</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can’t be made to take a drugs test but if you refuse when your employer has good grounds for testing, you may face disciplinary action.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="email-cctv-and-other-monitoring"><header><h1>Part 3: Email, CCTV and other monitoring</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer must explain the amount of monitoring clearly in your staff handbook or contract. They should tell you:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you are being monitored</li>
  <li>what counts as a reasonable number of personal emails and phone calls</li>
  <li>if personal emails and calls are not allowed</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of monitoring could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>looking at which websites you’ve visited</li>
  <li>CCTV in the building where you work</li>
  <li>checking your bag as you leave</li>
</ul>
<p>Your employer is not allowed to monitor you everywhere (not in the toilet, for example). If they don’t respect this they could be in breach of the Data Protection Act.</p>

<p>If you’re not happy about the situation, read the advice on <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute" title="workplace disputes">workplace disputes</a> or talk to <a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1410" title="ACAS (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service)"><abbr title="the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">ACAS</abbr> (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service),</a> <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm" title="Citizens Advice">Citizens Advice</a> or your trade union representative.</p>
