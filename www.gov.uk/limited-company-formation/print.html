  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can set up a private limited company to run your business. You must appoint people to run the company (called ‘directors’) and register (or ‘incorporate’) it with Companies House. </p>

<p>Once the company is registered you’ll get a ‘Certificate of Incorporation,’ this confirms the company legally exists and shows the company number and date of formation.</p>

<p>Sole traders are personally responsible for their business debts, but the liability in a private company is usually limited to the shareholders. The liability depends on the type of company being created. </p>

<h2>Types of private limited company</h2>

<p>A private company limited by shares means the members’ (shareholders) liability is limited to the number of shares issued but not paid for. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
A shareholder has 500 shares at £1 each. At the time the company fails they have paid for 100 so they’re liable up to the value of shares they haven’t paid for (£400).</p>
</div>

<p>A private company limited by guarantee means the company members financially back the company up to a specific amount if things go wrong. </p>

</article><article id="register-your-company"><header><h1>Part 2: Register your company</h1>
  </header><h2>Before you register</h2>

<p>All limited companies must be registered (incorporated) with Companies House. To do this you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>the company’s name and registered address</li>
  <li>at least one director </li>
  <li>at least one shareholder</li>
  <li>details of the company’s shares - known as ‘memorandum of association’</li>
  <li>rules about how the company is run - known as ‘articles of association’</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to register</h2>

<p>You can do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/promo/webincs" title="Web Incorporation Service">online</a> - but only if the company is limited by shares and uses model <a href="/limited-company-formation/articles-of-association" title="Articles of association">articles of association</a> </li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/companyRegistrationPaper.shtml" title="Starting a new company - paper forms">by post using form IN01</a> - you must do this if you change the model articles or use your own</li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/toolsToHelp/formationAgents.shtml" title="Formation and company secretarial agents">using an agent</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Fees and how long it takes</h2>

<p>Online takes 48 hours and costs £15 (paid by debit or credit card or Paypal). </p>

<p>Postal applications take 8 to 10 days and cost £40 (paid by cheque made out to ‘Companies House’). You can get a same day service by post. It costs £100 but you must get your application to Companies House by 3pm. </p>

<h2>Where to send your form</h2>

<p>The address you need is on the form.</p>

</article><article id="company-name-and-address"><header><h1>Part 3: Company name and address</h1>
  </header><h2>Company name</h2>

<p>The names of all private limited companies in the UK must end in either ‘Limited’ or ‘Ltd’ and the name can’t: </p>

<ul>
<li>be the same as any other name on the Companies House <a rel="external" href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/toolsToHelp/findCompanyInfo.shtml" title="Check registered company names">index of names</a>
</li>
  <li>contain a ‘sensitive’ word or expression unless you <a rel="external" href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/gbhtml/gp1.shtml#appA" title="Check which words you need permission to use">get permission</a>
</li>
  <li>suggest a connection with government or local authorities</li>
  <li>be offensive</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The Welsh equivalents of ‘Limited’ or ‘Ltd’ are ‘Cyfyngedig’ and ‘Cyf’.</p>
</div>

<p>Companies House has more guidance on <a rel="external" href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/gbhtml/gp1.shtml#ch6" title="Rules around choosing a company name">company names.</a> </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Registering a company name doesn’t mean your trademark is protected, you have to <a href="/register-a-trademark" title="Register a trademark">register trademarks separately</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Registered address</h2>

<p>The registered office address is where official communications are sent - eg letters from Companies House and HM Revenue &amp; Customs. The address doesn’t have to be where you operate your business from but it must be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a physical address - it can’t be a Post Office box</li>
  <li>in the same country that your company is registered in - eg a company registered in Wales must have a registered address in Wales</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use your home address or the address of the person who will manage your Corporation Tax if these addresses meet the rules above. </p>

</article><article id="directors-and-company-secretaries"><header><h1>Part 4: Directors and company secretaries</h1>
  </header><h2>Directors</h2>

<p>When you register your company it must have at least 1 director. </p>

<p>A director is legally responsible for running the company. A director must be older than 16 and not be someone disqualified from being a director.</p>

<p>You can make another company a director - but at least 1 of your company’s directors must be an individual.</p>

<p>Directors have <a href="/running-a-limited-company/directors-responsibilities" title="Directors' responsibilities">responsibilities</a> that include making sure the company is run properly.</p>

<h2>Company secretaries</h2>

<p>You don’t need a company secretary for a private limited company. Some companies use them to take on some of the director’s responsibilities. </p>

<p>The company secretary can be a director but can’t be: </p>

<ul>
<li>the company’s auditor</li>
  <li>an ‘undischarged bankrupt’ - unless they have permission from the court</li>
</ul>
<p>The restrictions placed on a person when they’re made bankrupt usually end when they’re discharged. You can check if someone has been discharged using the <a href="/search-bankruptcy-insolvency-register" title="Register of undischarged bankrupts">Insolvency Register.</a></p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Even if you have a company secretary, the directors remain legally responsible for the company.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="shareholders"><header><h1>Part 5: Shareholders</h1>
  </header><p>When you register a company you’ll need to make a ‘statement of capital’. This is: </p>

<ul>
<li>the number of shares the company has and their total value - known as the company’s ‘share capital’</li>
  <li>the names and addresses of all shareholders - known as ‘subscribers’ or ‘members’</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
A company that issues 500 shares at £1 each has a share capital of £500.</p>
</div>

<p>Every limited company must have at least one shareholder, there’s no maximum number. Directors can be shareholders. </p>

<h2>Role of shareholders</h2>

<p>Shareholders are owners of the company and they have certain rights eg, directors must get shareholders to vote and agree on changes to the company. </p>

</article><article id="articles-of-association"><header><h1>Part 6: Articles of association</h1>
  </header><p>When you register your company you must have articles of association. </p>

<p>These are the rules about running the company that shareholders and ‘officers’ (directors or company secretary) have to agree to. For example, rules about how decisions that affect the company must be made and the role of shareholders in those decisions.  </p>

<p>Most companies use standard (‘model’) articles - but you can change these or write your own as long as the company doesn’t break the law. </p>
