  </header><p>You can search for volunteer placements:</p>

<ul>
<li>on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.do-it.org.uk/" title="Do-it">Do-it</a> website</li>
  <li>in your local community through <a rel="external" href="http://www.csv.org.uk/?display=volunteering/" title="Community Service Volunteers">Community Service Volunteers</a> and by checking local noticeboards (eg, in your library) or newspapers </li>
  <li>on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.vso.org.uk/" title="VSO">VSO</a> website, if you are looking for overseas placements </li>
  <li>by contacting your <a rel="external" href="http://www.volunteering.org.uk/finder" title="Find your local volunteer centre">local Volunteer Centre</a>
</li>
</ul></article><article id="volunteering-for-young-people"><header><h1>Part 2: Volunteering for young people</h1>
  </header><p>You can also register for volunteer placements through:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a rel="external" href="http://nationalcitizenservice.direct.gov.uk/" title="National Citizen Service">National Citizen Service website</a>, if you’re 16 to 17 years old in England or Wales, or 15 to 16  in Northern Ireland.</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ics-uk.org.uk/about/" title="International Citizen Service">International Citizen Service website</a>, if you’d like to volunteer abroad and are between 18 and 25</li>
</ul></article><article id="your-rights"><header><h1>Part 3: Your rights</h1>
  </header><p>Most volunteers don’t have a contract of employment, so don’t have the rights of an employee or worker.</p>

<p>You’re usually given a volunteer agreement that explains:</p>

<ul>
<li>the level of supervision and support you’ll get</li>
  <li>what training you’ll get</li>
  <li>whether you’re covered under the organisation’s employer or public liability insurance</li>
  <li>health and safety issues</li>
  <li>any <a href="pay-and-expenses" title="Pay and expenses">expenses</a> the organisation will cover</li>
</ul>
<p>The volunteer agreement isn’t compulsory, but sets out what you can expect from the organisation. It doesn’t form a contract between you and the organisation. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) has information on <a rel="external" href="http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/advice-support/workforce-development/hr-employment-practice/managing-volunteers/legal-status/" title="Volunteers’ legal status">volunteers’ legal status.</a></p>


</article><article id="pay-and-expenses"><header><h1>Part 4: Pay and expenses</h1>
  </header><p>You won’t be paid for your time as a volunteer but you may get money to cover expenses. This is usually limited to covering food, drink and travel or any equipment you need to buy. </p>

<p>If you get any other payment or benefit in kind, you may be classed as an <a href="/employment-status/employee" title="Employment status: employee">employee</a> or <a href="/employment-status/worker" title="Employment status: worker">worker</a>, rather than a volunteer. This means you have certain employment rights, like getting the <a href="/your-right-to-minimum-wage/" title="Your right to the minimum wage">minimum wage</a>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>You volunteer to work at a company to get some work experience. You’re given travel expenses even though you walk to work. This is payment, rather than out-of-pocket expenses. It means you must be paid at least the minimum wage.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>You’re an unpaid intern at a record company, but you’re given free CDs as a perk. The CDs are ‘benefits in kind’. They mean you must be paid at least the minimum wage.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="when-you-can-volunteer"><header><h1>Part 5: When you can volunteer</h1>
  </header><h2>Age limits</h2>

<p>There’s no upper age limit on volunteering. However, some organisations’ insurance policies don’t cover people under 16 or over a certain age (usually 80). </p>

<p>Under 14s <strong>can’t</strong> work for a profit-making organisation, even if they’re not paid. </p>

<p>Some local councils have bylaws with extra rules about the work young people can do. For example, they may see a charity shop as a profit-making organisation and not let young people volunteer in them.</p>

</div>

<h2>If you’re on benefits</h2>

<p>You can volunteer and claim benefits if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the only money you get from volunteering is to cover expenses, like travel costs</li>
  <li>you continue to meet the conditions of the benefit you get</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2>If you’ve got a criminal record</h2>

<p>You can volunteer but depending on your offence you may not be able to volunteer in certain roles. You might need a <a href="/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check" title="Get a Criminal Records Bureau check">criminal records check</a> if you want to volunteer with children or vulnerable adults. </p>
