<ul>
<li>lend clothing to employees who earn <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year</li>

</table></article><article id="work-out-the-value"><header><h1>Part 4: Work out the value</h1>
  </header><p>The value of clothing for tax and reporting depends on whether you give or lend it, who initially pays for it, and how much the employee earns.</p>

<h2>Clothing you give to employees</h2>

<p>If the employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of more than £8,500 a year, or is a director, use whichever is the higher of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the second-hand value of the clothing when you give it to your employee</li>
  <li>the initial cost to you of the clothing</li>
</ul>
<p>If they earn <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year, use the second-hand value of the clothing when you gave it to your employee.</p>

<h2>Clothing you lend to employees</h2>

<p>Use whichever is the higher of:</p>

<ul>
<li>20% of the clothing’s market value when you first provided it</li>
  <li>any annual rental or hire charges you pay for it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clothing your employees buy and you pay them back for, or cleaning and repair costs</h2>

<p>Use the amount of money you give you employee for the clothing, cleaning or repair.</p>
