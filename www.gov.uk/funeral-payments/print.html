  </header><p>If you’re on a low income and need help to pay for a funeral you’re arranging, you could get a Funeral Payment.</p>

<p>How much you get depends on your circumstances and if you <a href="/funeral-payments/eligibility" title="Eligibility">qualify</a>. </p>

<h2>Repayments</h2>

<p>Any money you get is usually paid back from the deceased person’s estate (if they have one). For example, any money or property they had. </p>

<p>A house or personal things left to a widow, widower or surviving civil partner are not counted as part of the estate.</p>
