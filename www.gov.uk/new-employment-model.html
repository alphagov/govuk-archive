<p>The New Employment Model (<abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr>) signifies the government’s commitment to deliver a modernised terms and conditions of service ‘offer’. It will be designed to meet the expectations of a generation that has yet to join, but will be delivered in a way that continues to support and motivate existing service personnel. It will, necessarily, be a long-term, incremental change programme. Although not part of the <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr>, the Future Armed Forces Pension Scheme is linked to its development.</p>

<h2 id="announcement">Announcement</h2>

<p>Stage I (Concept Development) of the <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> programme is complete. Following Defence Board approval, Stage II (Policy Design) has now commenced and will last until April 2014. <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> implementation will commence no later than April 2015, although it may be possible to introduce certain components beforehand. Full implementation is not expected before 2020.</p>

<p>When the Strategic Defence and Security Review (<abbr title="Strategic Defence and Security Review">SDSR</abbr>) was published in October 2010, the Government made a commitment in respect of Service personnel to:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure that service in the Armed Forces remains an attractive choice in a rapidly evolving employment market </li>
  <li>better balance the demands placed on our people and their families, providing greater domestic stability whilst continuing to support mobility where this is essential to defence requirements</li>
  <li>the current employment model for Service personnel has changed very little over the last 40 years. It needs to be updated in order to meet the needs of today’s and tomorrow’s modern Armed Force.</li>
</ul>
<p>The component parts of the <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> are being designed so that they meet the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>attractiveness – addressing the personal, social and domestic impacts of Service both now and beyond 2020 in order to recruit and retain personnel of the right quality to the point of Service need.</li>
  <li>agility – enabling the Services to respond more quickly to changing requirements.</li>
  <li>affordability – The <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> is not a cost cutting exercise, but it is about delivering improved value for money within the same resource envelope.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> will implement changes which aim to:</p>

<ul>
<li>deliver an offer to regular Service personnel that supports domestic stability, and supports partners’ employment; both these issues are consistently cited in the Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey as the top two reasons that increase the intention to leave as careers progress</li>
  <li>provide a degree of choice which supports an active and rewarding career in the Armed Forces, enabled through career structures and management that allow opportunities for Part-Time Working in both Regular and Reserve service in keeping with the concept of the ‘Whole Force’, enable substantially closer alignment of Regular and Reserve terms and conditions of service.</li>
  <li>deliver a coherent, long term accommodation strategy that supports genuine lifestyle choice; increases levels of home ownership; reduces the demand for service families accommodation; improves public accommodation standards and choice; and is fair and attractive</li>
  <li>provide a revised pay offer that targets reward more efficiently and potentially enables greater differentiation between Service personnel in terms of their knowledge, skills and experience</li>
  <li>simplify and harmonise allowances to make them simpler to understand and more efficient to administer</li>
  <li>deliver training and education that maximises the benefits of Service career and personal development</li>
  <li>enable the individual Services to operate more effective manning controls</li>
  <li>reserves are an integral part of Defence Capability and the <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> will be designed to support a whole force approach to manning, bringing terms and conditions of service (<abbr title="terms and conditions of service">TACOS</abbr>) up to date for both Regular and Reserve personnel so that they meet the needs of today’s and tomorrow’s modern Armed Forces. The results of the Future Reserves 2020 consultation exercise will be integrated into the <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> forms part of the wider transformation of defence. Under the new Defence Operating Model, it will provide the single Services with a central framework of <abbr title="terms and conditions of service">TACOS</abbr> and, where appropriate, the delegations within which they can maximise flexibility to meet the operational needs of their individual Service.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-nem-will-look">How the <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> will look</h2>

<p>The key design features of the <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="career-and-lifestyle-choice">Career and lifestyle choice</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> will provide a degree of choice so that personnel can make an informed assessment of how they wish to balance their private and professional lives. This will be enabled through career structures that allow opportunities for Part Time Working in both Regular and Reserve service, and through changes to career management, as well as other aspects of the offer, such as accommodation.</p>

<h3 id="balancing-domestic-stability-and-the-requirement-for-mobility">Balancing domestic stability and the requirement for mobility</h3>

<p>A predominantly UK based Armed Forces in the future offers opportunities for decision-making on basing laydown, force generation and routine employment of Regular and Reserves which, together, should promote and support greater domestic stability. This will help to address the AFCAS “top two” (the impact of Service on family and personal life; and spousal/partner career opportunities). Although Service personnel will become more domestically stable over time, there will remain an enduring requirement to enable mobility in order to gain experience, provide a suitably rewarding career and to maximise operational capability.</p>

<h3 id="differentiation">Differentiation</h3>

<p>Differentiation in <abbr title="terms and conditions of service">TACOS</abbr> between different types of Service personnel at different stages of their careers happens to some extent already, but the <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> will be based on a common framework which will enable differentiation to be applied more consistently across the Services. Changes in the way we differentiate between our people will allow us to better target reward, including potentially through a greater emphasis on individual value. The <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> will examine differentiation in pay (based on knowledge, skills and experience), on accommodation (based on charging rates) and in other areas, such as officers’ career streaming (Executive and Defence Professional streams).</p>

<h3 id="manpower-control">Manpower control</h3>

<p><abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> aspires to make manpower control more flexible, efficient and adaptable to better support operational capability. This will enable the single Services to better manage the flow of their personnel through the various stages of a career.</p>

<h3 id="delegation">Delegation</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> will support the Defence Reform approach to the delegation of authority to the single Services, giving them flexibility to meet the operational needs of their individual Service within a common <abbr title="terms and conditions of service">TACOS</abbr> framework.</p>

<h2 id="nem-communications-and-consultation">
<abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> communications and consultation</h2>

<p>A period of consultation with Service personnel and other key stakeholders is planned to commence in Summer 2013 to help shape some of the detailed design of the <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr>. This will be part of a wider programme of communications about the <abbr title="New Employment Model">NEM</abbr> which will be delivered when it is possible to provide more detail.</p>
