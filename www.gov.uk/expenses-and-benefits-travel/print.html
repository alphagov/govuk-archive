  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer paying your employees’ travel costs, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<p>This includes costs for:</p>

<ul>
<li>providing travel</li>
  <li>reimbursing travel</li>
  <li>meals and other ‘subsistance’ while travelling</li>
  <li>accommodation (if your employee needs to stay away overnight)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There are different rules for reporting expenses relating to <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-public-transport" title="expenses relating to public transport">public transport</a>.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><h2>Business travel you provide, pay for or reimburse</h2>

<p>If your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year, you won’t need to report or pay.</p>

<p>Business journeys are either:</p>

<ul>
<li>journeys that are part of your employees duties, eg a service engineer travelling to an appointment</li>
  <li>journeys an employee has to make to get to a temporary workplace</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you pay more than the cost of the travel, you’ll have to <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-travel/what-to-report-and-pay" title="report the expense">report the expense</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Private travel</h2>

<p>If you arrange and pay for the travel, and your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year, you won’t need to report or pay.</p>

<p>You’ll be exempt from reporting or paying anything for all employees and directors if the cost is for:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/expenses-and-benefits-works-bus-services" title="Works bus services: reporting expenses and benefits">a works bus service</a></li>
  <li>an <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-items-for-disabled-employees" title="Items for disabled employees: reporting expenses and benefits">employee with a disability</a> (but only in certain circumstances)</li>
  <li>a taxi home after occasional and irregular late-night working</li>
  <li>a taxi home if a car-sharing system is temporarily unavailable</li>
  <li><a href="/expenses-and-benefits-bikes-for-employees" title="Bikes for employees: reporting expenses and benefits">bicycles or cycle safety equipment</a></li>
  <li>travelling to work because public transport has been disrupted by industrial action</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If your employees’ travel isn’t <a href="/work-travel-reporting-expenses-and-benefits/what-is-exempt" title="Work travel and your employees (What is exempt)">exempt</a> you must report it to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and may have to deduct or pay tax and National Insurance on it.</p>

<h2>Business travel</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can apply for a <a href="/apply-for-a-dispensation" title="dispensation">dispensation</a>, which means you won’t have to include business travel expenses on your end-of-year reports.</p>
</div>

<p>If you don’t have a dispensation, you should report in the following way:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Who gets the benefit</th>
      <th>What to do</th>
      <th>What to deduct or pay</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of more than £8,500 a year</td>
      <td>Report on form P11D, section K, B or N</td>
      <td>Nothing</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Directors</td>
      <td>Report on form P11D, section K, B or N</td>
      <td>Nothing</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Reimbursing more than the necessary costs</h3>

<p>If you reimburse your employee with more than the necessary costs of their business travel, the extra amount counts as earnings, so: </p>

<ul>
<li>add it to your employee’s other earnings</li>
  <li>deduct and pay <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax and Class 1 National Insurance through payroll</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’ve agreed with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> that this will be a <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-cash-sum-payments/scale-rate-payments" title="scale rate payments">scale rate payment</a>, you won’t need to report it.</p>
</div>

<h2>Private travel</h2>

<p>All non-business travel is counted as private. This includes the journey between an employee’s home and permanent workplace. </p>

<p>For employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or more a year, or for directors, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>report on form P11D, section B</li>
  <li>add the cost of the transport to the employee’s other earnings and deduct and pay Class 1 National Insurance (but not <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax) through payroll</li>
