  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re a vehicle operator, your drivers might be stopped at the roadside by the police or the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) for <a href="/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers" title="roadside vehicle checks for commercial drivers">vehicle inspections</a>.  </p>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> uses the Operator Compliance Risk Score (<abbr title="Operator Compliance Risk Score">OCRS</abbr>) system to decide which vehicles should be inspected. </p>

<p><abbr title="Operator Compliance Risk Score">OCRS</abbr> is used to calculate the risk of an operator not following the rules on roadworthiness (the condition of its vehicles) and traffic (eg drivers’ hours, weighing checks). </p>

<p>If your <abbr title="Operator Compliance Risk Score">OCRS</abbr> is high, it’s more likely that your vehicles will be inspected. </p>


</article><article id="how-the-system-works"><header><h1>Part 2: How the system works</h1>
  </header><p>The Operator Compliance Risk Score (<abbr title="Operator Compliance Risk Score">OCRS</abbr>) system is based on data collected by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) over a 3-year rolling period. </p>

<p>Data is taken from annual tests, roadside inspections and inspections at operators’ premises.</p>

<p>Scoring is split into 2 areas:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Category</th>
      <th>Where the data comes from</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Roadworthiness</td>
      <td>Vehicle tests (first tests, subsequent annual tests); ‘vehicle encounters’ (fleet check inspections at operator premises, roadside inspections)</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Traffic</td>
      <td>Roadside inspections and prosecutions (eg for drivers’ hours and tachograph offences, weighing checks)</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As an operator you get points when a test or inspection finds a defect or infringement of the rules. The more serious the defect or infringement, the more points.</p>

<p>You’ll be given a score, which will be shown as R (red - highest risk), A (amber - medium risk) or G (green - lowest risk).</p>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s <abbr title="Operator Compliance Risk Score">OCRS</abbr> guidance notes explain how the scores are worked out.</p>

</div>

<p>You might have no score if <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> doesn’t have any data for you from the past 3 years.</p>

<h2>Operators outside Great Britain</h2>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has a non-GB <abbr title="Operator Compliance Risk Score">OCRS</abbr> system for operators based outside Great Britain. </p>

<p>It’s based on the same rules and scores as the GB version, but only includes data captured at the roadside as no annual test or prosecution data is available. </p>


</article><article id="how-your-score-can-change"><header><h1>Part 3: How your score can change</h1>
  </header><p>Because your Operator Compliance Risk Score (<abbr title="Operator Compliance Risk Score">OCRS</abbr>) is <a href="/operator-compliance-risk-score/how-the-system-works" title="how the OCRS system works">calculated</a> over a 3-year rolling period, it can change after inspections, tests or prosecutions against you. </p>

<p>The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) calls these ‘encounters’. Your score could change if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>commit a new offence or have a defect recorded against you at inspection (this has a negative effect on your score)</li>
  <li>have a ‘clear encounter’ - eg you pass an inspection without any problems (this has a positive effect on your score)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re prosecuted by <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> you’ll get points from the date of prosecution, not the date of the offence.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The lower your <abbr title="Operator Compliance Risk Score">OCRS</abbr> is, the better.</p>
</div>

<h2>Old encounters</h2>

<p>Your score also changes as old encounters that previously counted towards your score no longer count once they’re not in the <abbr title="Operator Compliance Risk Score">OCRS</abbr> calculation period. </p>

<p>If you had clear encounters included in your score and these are now outside the calculation period, this might mean your score goes up. But if you had negative encounters included and these no longer count, your score might go down.</p>

<h2>Trigger events</h2>

<p>These are serious problems that will send you straight into the red score band for a set period of time. </p>

<p>Once this time is up, your score returns to whatever your base score is at the time. Your base score is your <abbr title="Operator Compliance Risk Score">OCRS</abbr> without the trigger taken into account.</p>

<p>There’s a list of offences that can send your score straight to red on page 10 of <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s frequently asked questions.</p>

</div>

<h2>Year weightings</h2>

<p>The impact of an offence or defect decreases over the 3-year time period. </p>

<p>For the first 12 months after the offence or defect, its score stays the same. After 12 months it falls by a quarter and then it’s halved in the final 12 months.</p>

<h2>Other changes</h2>

<p>There are a number of ‘parameters’ that feed into your <abbr title="Operator Compliance Risk Score">OCRS</abbr>. <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> sets these and can change them at any time - this has an impact on your score.</p>

<p>The parameters are:</p>

<ul>
<li>points for offences and defects</li>
  <li>points for prosecutions</li>
  <li>time weightings</li>
  <li>band thresholds (these determine whether you’re in the red, amber or green band)</li>
  <li>trigger events and time periods</li>
</ul>
<p>The values for all parameters are available on page 9 of <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s frequently asked questions.</p>
