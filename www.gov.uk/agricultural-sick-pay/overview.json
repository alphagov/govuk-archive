This doesn't include overtime you regularly work that isn't guaranteed. This number tells you how many days you can claim over a 12 month period starting from the first day of sickness or injury that's eligible.\r\n\r\nThe period you can claim for starts on the first full working day you're unable to work and ends on the day before you return. This can be any day, including days you don't usually work.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:** Laura has been continuously employed for 38 months and works 4 days a week. She multiplies 19 by 4 to get 76.
