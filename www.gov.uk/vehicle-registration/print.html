  </header><h2>New vehicles</h2>
<p>If you buy a brand new vehicle, the dealer will usually take care of all the necessary arrangements to register it to you.</p>

<h2>Used vehicles</h2>

<p>The way a used vehicle is registered to you depends on whether it has a registration certificate - also known as a V5C.</p>

<h3>Vehicle has a registration certificate (V5C)</h3>

<p>The seller must:</p>

<ul>
<li>complete section 6 of the V5C (‘new keeper or new name/new address details’)</li>
  <li>sign the declaration in section 8 (you must do this too)</li>
  <li>fill in section 10 (‘new keeper supplement’) and give it to you - this section is also known as the V5C/2</li>
  <li>send the V5C to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> aims to send out a new V5C to you within 2 to 4 weeks of getting the old V5C from the seller. </p>

<p>If you don’t get it within 4 weeks:</p>

<ul>
<li>complete form V62 ‘Application for a registration certificate’</li>
  <li>send it to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> with the V5C/2 given to you by the seller - if you don’t send in the V5C/2, you’ll have to pay a fee</li>
</ul>
<p>Download form V62 or get it from any Post Office branch or <a href="/dvla-offices" title="Get contact details for your local DVLA office"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> local office</a>.</p>

</article><article id="new-registrations"><header><h1>Part 3: New registrations</h1>

  <li>a kit car</li>
  <li>imported</li>
  <li>been rebuilt or radically altered</li>
  <li>an old or classic vehicle</li>

<h2>Making an application</h2>

<h3>Fill in form V55/4 or V55/5</h3>

<p>For any type of newly registered vehicle, you must fill in either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a V55/4 form - use this to register a <strong>new</strong> vehicle, including new imported vehicles and newly-built (kit) cars</li>
  <li>a V55/5 form - use this to register a <strong>used</strong> vehicle, including rebuilt vehicles, used imported vehicles and older vehicles that have never been registered</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get the forms from <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="https://www.dvla.gov.uk/dvla/onlineservices/order_forms.aspx?ext=dg" title="DVLA form ordering service">form ordering service.</a></p>

<h3>Provide identity documents</h3>

  <li>a certificate of newness (or declaration of newness for imported vehicles), if the vehicle’s new</li>
  <li>any documents you have relating to the vehicle - eg build plans if it’s a kit car</li>
  <li>evidence of type approval (if required)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>After you’ve given <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> your application</h2>
<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> might need to inspect your vehicle. If your application is approved, it will send you a Vehicle Registration Certificate (V5C), commonly known as a logbook. This shows:</p>

<ul>
<li>the vehicle’s registration number</li>
  <li>the vehicle keeper’s name and address</li>
  <li>other information about the vehicle (the make, vehicle identification number (VIN) and number of previous keepers)</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will also send you the vehicle tax disc and your identity documents.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you want the documents returned by special delivery, you’ll need to provide a prepaid self-addressed, special delivery envelope.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> can’t guarantee the return of the documents by a specific date. It aims to deliver a new registration certificate to you within 6 weeks of getting your application. </p>

  </header><p>All vehicles registered in the UK must have a unique, stamped-in vehicle identification number (<abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>) and registration number. </p>

<h2>Find your <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr> is usually stamped into the chassis of the vehicle. It may be lost if you rebuild or modify your vehicle.</p>

<h2>When you may need a new <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr> or registration</h2>

<p>If you have a kit car, rebuild, or radically altered vehicle, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will usually have to assess it.</p>

<p>If you can prove the vehicle’s original <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>, you may be able to keep its original registration number. If you can’t, you’ll have to apply for a replacement identity number.</p>

<p>If your vehicle passes its assessment, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will give you an authorisation letter to get the vehicle stamped with the new <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>. </p>

<p>You then need to register the vehicle - you can only do this when <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> receives confirmation it’s been stamped with the correct <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Allocating your own <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You may be able to choose your own unique 17-digit <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have a kit built or kit converted car</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr> has not already been allocated by <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>
</li>
