<p>It’s illegal to modify the exhaust system to make a vehicle noisier after it has been ‘type approved’ (checked it meets environmental and safety standards).</p>

<p>The police can also take action if your vehicle’s silencer doesn’t work or if you’re driving in a way that creates too much noise.</p>

</article><article id="noise-from-roads"><header><h1>Part 2: Noise from roads</h1>
  </header><p>There’s no legal limit to road noise, although noise levels might be taken into account when new roads or houses and offices near roads are planned.</p>

<h2>Planned new roads</h2>

<p>Local highway authorities assess noise when planning a new road to see if it will be noisier at your property when the new road opens.</p>

<p>If noise from a new road exceeds certain limits at existing houses, you might be able to get a noise insulation grant for your home.</p>

<p>To apply, or if you’re worried about the noise from a planned road scheme, contact your highway authority – get their contact details from your <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1" title="Find your local council">local council.</a></p>

<h3>Compulsory purchase and road noise</h3>

<p>When a new road is built, it often involves the ‘compulsory purchase’ of land to make way for the road.</p>

<p>You might be able to get compensation if a compulsory purchase means you become affected by road noise - the following booklets explain the process.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/compulsorypurchase" title="Booklet 1">Booklet 1</a> explains the overall process – read this first.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/compulsorypurchase5" title="Booklet 5">Booklet 5</a> explains noise reduction work you might be able to get.</p>

</article><article id="railway-noise"><header><h1>Part 3: Railway noise</h1>
  </header><p>There are no legal limits to noise from existing railways.</p>

<p>If noise from a new railway affects your property you might be able to get a noise insulation grant. Ask your <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1" title="Find your local council">local council</a> for more details.</p>

<p>If particular trains are causing you a problem, speak to the company running those trains. </p>

<p>Find information on train operators on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/tocs_maps/tocs/" title="National Rail website">National Rail website</a> or call Network Rail’s 24-hour helpline on 08457 114 141.</p>

</article><article id="aircraft-noise"><header><h1>Part 4: Aircraft noise</h1>
  </header><p>Noise is regulated at all UK airports and there are different noise limits for day and night flights.</p>

<p>Other rules include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>air traffic should fly over the least-populated areas on take-off whenever practical</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there should be restrictions on night flights (for example a partial ban on night flights or complete phase-out of the noisiest aircraft)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are also grant schemes to install noise insulation in affected homes. Contact the airport that affects you to apply.</p>
