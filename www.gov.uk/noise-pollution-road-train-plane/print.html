  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="vehicle-noise-limits"><header><h1>Part 1: Vehicle noise limits</h1>
  </header><p>There are limits to the amount of noise that vehicles can make on public roads. This applies to all types of vehicles. </p>

<p>In general, larger vehicles with bigger engines are able to make more noise. </p>

<h2>Noise limits on tyres</h2>

<p>There are noise limits on tyres and from November 2012 all new tyres will be graded and labelled to show how noisy they are.</p>

<h2>Modified exhaust systems</h2>

<p>It’s illegal to modify the exhaust system to make a vehicle noisier after it has been ‘type approved’ (checked it meets environmental and safety standards).</p>

<p>The police can also take action if your vehicle’s silencer doesn’t work in the way it was designed or if you’re driving in a way that creates too much noise.</p>

</article><article id="noise-from-roads"><header><h1>Part 2: Noise from roads</h1>
  </header><p>There’s no legal limit to road noise, although noise levels might be taken into account when new roads or houses and offices near roads are planned.</p>

<h2>Planned new roads</h2>

<p>When planning a new road local highway authorities assess how the noise at your property will change when the road opens.</p>

<p>If noise from a new road exceeds certain levels at your home you might be able to get compensation in the form of sound insulation.</p>

<p>To apply, or if you’re worried about the noise from a planned road scheme, contact your highway authority – get their details from your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">local council.</a></p>

<h3>Compulsory purchase and road noise</h3>

<p>When a new road is built, it often involves the ‘compulsory purchase’ of land to make way for the road.</p>

<p>You might be able to get compensation if a compulsory purchase means you become affected by road noise - the following booklets explain the process.</p>

</article><article id="railway-noise"><header><h1>Part 3: Railway noise</h1>
  </header><p>There are no legal limits to noise from existing railways.</p>

<p>If noise from a new railway affects your property you might be able to get compensation in the form or sound insulation for your home. </p>

<p>You’ll need to contact the relevant rail authority. Ask your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">local council</a> for more details.</p>

<p>If particular trains are causing you a problem, speak to the company running those trains. </p>

<p>Find information on train operators on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/tocs_maps/tocs/" title="National Rail website">National Rail website</a> or call Network Rail’s 24-hour helpline on 08457 114 141.</p>

</article><article id="aircraft-noise"><header><h1>Part 4: Aircraft noise</h1>
  </header><p>Noise is regulated to some extent at all UK airports. This can include noise limits and restrictions on night flights. </p>

<p>Aircraft paths are generally designed, where possible, to fly over the least populated areas.</p>

<p>Some airports operate grant schemes to install sound insulation in affected homes. Contact the airport that affects you to find out if they run one. </p>

<p>The Civil Aviation Authority (<abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr>) has published more information on aircraft noise and emissions in a factsheet.</p>

<h3>Complaining about aircraft noise</h3>

<p>To complain about noise or aircraft activities in general, get in touch with the relevant airport.</p>

<h3>Military aircraft</h3>

<p>Military aircraft are covered by different rules.</p>

<p>To complain about military aircraft noise or low flying military aircraft, go to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/AirSafetyandAviation/LowFlying/HowDoIComplainAboutMilitaryLowFlyingActivity.htm" title="Ministry of Defence (MOD) website.">Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) website.</a></p>


</article><article id="further-information"><header><h1>Part 5: Further information</h1>
  </header><p>There are <a rel="external" href="http://services.defra.gov.uk/wps/portal/noise/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hnd0cPE3MfAwMD42BTA093f1Nvk2ATAwNnA6B8JG55A2MCusNB9uHXD5I3wAEcDfT9PPJzU_ULciMMskwcFQHW4PMe/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh" title="Strategic noise maps for England">strategic noise maps for England</a> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) website. </p>

<p>These estimate noise from:</p>

<ul>
<li>major roads - those with more than 6 million vehicle passages annually</li>
  <li>major railways - those with more than 60,000 train passages annually</li>
  <li>major airports - those with more than 50,000 aircraft movements annually (except for training on light aircraft)</li>
</ul>
<p>They also estimate noise in urban areas (with populations greater than 250,000 and a certain population density).</p>
