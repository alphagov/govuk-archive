</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer paying your employees’ children’s school fees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>


</article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or pay tax and National Insurance if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>the contract is between you and the school</li>
  <li>you pay the fees directly</li>
  <li>your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the school fees aren’t <a href="/expenses-benefits-school-fees-for-employees-child/whats-exempt" title="exemptions">exempt</a>, you may have to report the costs to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and you may have to deduct and pay tax and National Insurance. </p>

<h2>If your employee pays and you reimburse the fees</h2>

<p>This counts as earnings, so you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>add the cost of the fees to the employee’s other earnings</li>
  <li>deduct and pay Class 1 National Insurance and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax through payroll</li>
</ul>
<h2>The contract is between your employee and the school, but you pay the fees directly</h2>
