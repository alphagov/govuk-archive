  </header><h2>When you can get State Pension</h2>

<p>The earliest you can get your State Pension is when you reach <a href="/calculate-state-pension" title="State Pension age">your State Pension age.</a> If you retire before you reach this age, you’ll have to wait till then to claim your State Pension.</p>

<h2>How much State Pension you get</h2>

<p>Your <a href="/state-pension/overview" title="State Pension">State Pension</a> depends on the number of years you’ve paid <a href="/national-insurance" title="National Insurance">National Insurance</a> or got <a href="/national-insurance-credits" title="National Insurance credits">National Insurance credits</a> while claiming certain benefits. </p>

<p>You need 30 years to get a full State Pension of £107.45. If you have fewer years when you retire you’ll get less State Pension. </p>

</article><article id="personal-and-workplace-pensions"><header><h1>Part 2: Personal and workplace pensions</h1>
  </header><h2>When you get your personal or workplace pension</h2>

<p>When you can get your pension will depend on your pension scheme’s rules, but it’s usually after you’re 55.</p>

<p>You may be able to take your pension before this age if you’re retiring because of ill-health.</p>

<h3>If you have serious ill-health</h3>
<p>You can retire at any age if you have serious ill-health and you have less than a year’s life expectancy. You can take up to 100% of your pension fund as a tax-free lump sum. </p>

<p>If you’re married or a civil partner when you take the payment, the pension scheme must keep at least 50% of your pension pot to provide a pension for your husband, wife or civil partner.</p>

<h2>Defined contribution pension schemes</h2>
<p>These are also known as ‘money purchase schemes.</p>

<p>Your pension pot is put into various types of investments, eg shares. The amount in your pension pot at retirement is based on how much has been paid in and how well the investments have performed. </p>

<p>Normally, when you retire, you can take some of your pension pot as a tax-free lump sum. You use the rest to buy yourself an income, on which you may pay tax. </p>

<p>Your pension will be smaller if you retire early because:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’ve had fewer years to pay into your pension</li>
  <li>your pension will need to last longer</li>
</ul>
<h2>Defined benefit pension schemes</h2>
<p>These are sometimes called ‘final salary’ or ‘career average’ earnings-related pension schemes.</p>

<p>The amount you get at retirement is based on a number of things, eg your earnings and how long you’ve been a member of the scheme. </p>

<p>In most schemes, when you retire you can take some of your pension as a tax-free lump sum. The rest you get as a regular income, on which you might pay tax. </p>

<p>If you’re considering early retirement you’ll probably get a smaller pension.</p>
