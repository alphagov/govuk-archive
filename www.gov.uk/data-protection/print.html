  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="the-data-protection-act"><header><h1>Part 1: The Data Protection Act</h1>
  </header><p>The Data Protection Act controls how your personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government. </p>

<p>Everyone who is responsible for using data has to follow strict rules called ‘data protection principles’. They must make sure the information is:</p>

<ul>
<li>used fairly and lawfully</li>
  <li>used for limited, specifically stated purposes</li>
  <li>used in a way that is adequate, relevant and not excessive</li>
  <li>accurate</li>
  <li>kept for no longer than is absolutely necessary</li>
  <li>handled according to people’s data protection rights</li>
  <li>kept safe and secure</li>
  <li>not transferred outside the UK without adequate protection</li>
</ul>
<p>There is stronger legal protection for more sensitive information, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>ethnic background</li>
  <li>political opinions</li>
  <li>religious beliefs</li>
  <li>health</li>
  <li>sexual health</li>
  <li>criminal records</li>
</ul></article><article id="find-out-what-data-an-organisation-has-about-you"><header><h1>Part 2: Find out what data an organisation has about you</h1>
  </header><p>The Data Protection Act gives you the right to find out what information the government and other organisations stores about you. </p>

<p>Write to the organisation and ask for a copy of the information they hold about you. If you do not know who in the organisation to write to, address your letter to the company secretary.</p>

<p>The organisation is legally required to provide you with a copy of the information they hold about you if you request it.</p>

<h2>When information can be withheld</h2>

<p>There are some situations when organisations are allowed to withhold information, eg if the information is about:</p>

<ul>
<li>the prevention, detection or investigation of a crime</li>
  <li>national security or the armed forces</li>
  <li>the assessment or collection of tax</li>
  <li>judicial or ministerial appointments</li>
</ul>
<p>An organisation doesn’t have to say why they are withholding information.</p>

<h2>How much it costs</h2>

<p>Some organisations may charge you for providing the information. The cost is usually no more than £10 but it can be more if the information is contained within either: </p>

<ul>
<li>certain types of records eg health or education records</li>
  <li>a large number of paper records held in an unstructured way by a public authority</li>
</ul></article><article id="make-a-complaint"><header><h1>Part 3: Make a complaint</h1>
  </header><p>If you think your data has been misused or that the organisation holding it hasn’t kept it secure, you should contact them and tell them. </p>

<p>If you are unhappy with their response or if you need any advice you should contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). </p>
