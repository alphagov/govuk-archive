  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Business travel</h2>

<p>Costs relating to business travel also count as business expenses, unless the travel is in the employee’s own vehicle. </p>

<p>For more details, see the guides on:</p>

<p>If you cover the costs of private expenses, this counts as earnings. You’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>add the amount to your employee’s other earnings</li>

  </header><p>If you provide your employees with a set amount of cash for some common business expenses like travel and meals, these are known as ‘scale rate payments’. </p>

<p>As long as your employee has actually spent the scale rate payment on business expenses, you won’t need to check every single receipt – it’s fine to just <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM05210.htm" title="scale rate sampling guidance">check a sample.</a></p>

<p>You can set up a scale rate payment by either:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/eim05200.htm" title="agree on a scale rate with HMRC">agreeing a scale rate with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>)</a> by providing evidence of typical expenses (eg receipts)</li>

</article><article id="round-sum-allowances"><header><h1>Part 5: Round sum allowances</h1>
  </header><p>If you provide a set amount of cash for employees regardless of how they spend it, this is known as a ‘round sum allowance’.</p>
