</article><article id="debt-management-plans"><header><h1>Part 2: Debt Management Plans</h1>
  </header><p>A Debt Management Plan is an agreement between you and your creditors to pay <strong>all</strong> of your debts. You make regular payments to a licensed debt management company. The company then shares this money out between your creditors.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/contact_us.htm/" title="Citizens Advice" rel="external">Citizens Advice</a> or the <a href="http://www.nationaldebtline.co.uk/" title="National Debtline" rel="external">National Debtline</a> can tell you if a Debt Management Plan is right for you.</p>
</div>

<h2>Get a Debt Management Plan</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Only set up a plan with a company licensed by the Office of Fair Trading. Find a <a href="http://www2.crw.gov.uk/pr/Default.aspx" title="Find a licensed debt management company" rel="external">licensed debt management company.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The company works out your monthly payments. You’ll have to give details about your  financial situation. For example, your assets, debts, income and creditors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The company contacts your creditors and asks them to agree to the plan (they don’t have to).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>Some companies will charge: </p>

<ul>
<li>a set up fee </li>
  <li>a handling fee each time you make a payment </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Make sure you understand the costs of your plan.</p>
</div>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>Debt Management Plans can only be used to pay ‘unsecured’ debts – for example, debts that haven’t been guaranteed against your property. </p>

<h2>Your responsibilities</h2>
<p>Your plan can be cancelled if you don’t keep up your repayments.</p>

</article><article id="administration-orders"><header><h1>Part 3: Administration orders</h1>
  </header><p>If you have a county court or High Court judgment against you, which you can’t pay in full, an administration order is a way to deal with the debt. </p>

<p>The debt must be less than £5,000. </p>

<p>You make one payment a month to your local court. The court will divide this money between your creditors. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/contact_us.htm/" title="Citizens Advice" rel="external">Citizens Advice</a> or the <a href="http://www.nationaldebtline.co.uk/" title="National Debtline" rel="external">National Debtline</a> can tell you if an administration order is right for you.</p>
</div>

<h2>Get an administration order</h2>

<p>To apply, fill in an <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=651" title="application for an administration order (N92)">application for an administration order (N92),</a> and return it to your local court.</p>

<p>The court decides: </p>

<ul>
<li>how much of your debt you have to repay – for example, all or just part of it </li>
  <li>how much your monthly repayments will be</li>
  <li>how long the arrangement lasts </li>
</ul>
<p>If you can’t pay all your debts the arrangement is known as a ‘composition order’. </p>

<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>There’s a court fee each time you make a payment. This can’t be more than 10% of your debt. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you owe £5,000 the total fee can’t be more than £500.</p>
</div>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>owe less than £5,000, including any interest and charges</li>
  <li>owe money to at least 2 creditors</li>
  <li>prove you can afford your repayments - for example, give details of your income </li>
  <li>have a county court or High Court judgment against you, which you can’t pay in full</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your responsibilities</h2>
<p>You must keep up your repayments or the court can:</p>

<ul>
<li>take money from your wages – known as an ‘attachment of earnings order’ </li>
  <li>cancel the arrangement </li>
</ul>
<h2>Public records</h2>
<p>Your administration order is added to the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines.</p>

<p>It’s usually removed 6 years after the date the order was made. </p>

<p>If you repay your debts in full your entry is marked as ‘satisfied’. </p>

<p>You can also ask the court for a ‘certificate of satisfaction’. To do this, write to the court and send a cheque for £15 (made payable to Her Majesty’s Courts &amp; Tribunal Service). </p>

</article><article id="individual-voluntary-arrangements"><header><h1>Part 4: Individual Voluntary Arrangements</h1>
  </header><p>An Individual Voluntary Arrangement is an agreement with your creditors to pay all or part of your debts. You agree to make regular payments to an ‘insolvency practitioner’, who will divide this money between your creditors. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/contact_us.htm/" title="Citizens Advice" rel="external">Citizens Advice</a> or the <a href="http://www.nationaldebtline.co.uk/" title="National Debtline" rel="external">National Debtline</a> can tell you if an Individual Voluntary Arrangement is right for you.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="debt-relief-orders"><header><h1>Part 5: Debt Relief Orders </h1>
  </header><p>Debt Relief Orders (DROs) are one way to deal with your debts if you owe less than £15,000, have little spare income and don’t own your home. </p>

<p>If you get one: </p>

<ul>
<li>your creditors can’t recover their money without the court’s permission</li>
  <li>you’re usually freed (‘discharged’) from your debts after 12 months </li>
</ul>
<h2>Get a Debt Relief Order</h2>
<p>You get a <abbr title="Debt Relief Orders">DRO</abbr> from the Official Receiver (an officer of the bankruptcy court), but you must apply through an <strong>authorised debt adviser</strong>. They’ll help you fill in the paperwork. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To find an authorised debt adviser contact <a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/contact_us.htm/" title="Citizens Advice" rel="external">Citizens Advice</a> or the <a href="http://www.nationaldebtline.co.uk/" title="National Debtline" rel="external">National Debtline.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>The Official Receiver’s fee is £90. Your debt adviser can tell you how and when to pay it. </p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>You’re generally eligible if all the below apply - you:</p>

<ul>
<li>owe less than £15,000</li>
  <li>have less than £50 a month spare income </li>
  <li>have less than £300 worth of assets</li>
  <li>have lived or worked in England and Wales within the last 3 years</li>
  <li>haven’t applied for a <abbr title="Debt Relief Orders">DRO</abbr> within the last 6 years</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<p>If you get a <abbr title="Debt Relief Orders">DRO</abbr> you must follow rules called ‘restrictions’. You can’t:</p>

<ul>
<li>borrow more than £500 without telling the lender about your <abbr title="Debt Relief Orders">DRO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>act as the director of a company</li>
  <li>create, manage or promote a company without the court’s permission</li>
  <li>manage a business without telling those you do business with about your <abbr title="Debt Relief Orders">DRO</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>When do the restrictions end?</h3>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Check the <a href="/search-bankruptcy-insolvency-register" title="Search the Individual Insolvency Register">Individual Insolvency Register</a> to see when the restrictions end.</p>
</div>

<p>The restrictions usually last 12 months. They can be extended if careless or dishonest behaviour caused your debt problem. For example, you lied to get credit. </p>

<p>The Official Receiver will tell you if they should be extended. To extend them, you’ll be asked to agree to a Debt Relief Restrictions Undertaking. If you don’t agree, the court can issue a Debt Relief Restrictions Order. </p>

<h2>What you need to know</h2>

<p>DROs can be cancelled if:</p>

<ul>
<li>your finances improve</li>
  <li>you don’t co-operate with the Official Receiver - eg give them information they ask for</li>
</ul>
<p>Your <abbr title="Debt Relief Orders">DRO</abbr> is added to the <a href="/search-bankruptcy-insolvency-register" title="Search the Individual Insolvency Register">Individual Insolvency Register</a> - it’s removed 3 months after the <abbr title="Debt Relief Orders">DRO</abbr> ends.</p>
