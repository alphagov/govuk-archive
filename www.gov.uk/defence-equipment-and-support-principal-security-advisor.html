<h3 id="understanding-uk-threat-levels">Understanding UK threat levels</h3>

<p>The threat of international terrorism comes from a diverse range of sources and a threat could manifest itself from a lone individual or group, rather than a larger network. The terrorist threat can take a number of forms, as terrorists may use a variety of methods of attack to achieve their objectives.</p>

<h3 id="the-threat-from-international-terrorism">The threat from international terrorism</h3>

<p>Whilst the UK has faced a variety of terrorist threats in the past, a unique combination of factors place the current threat on a scale not previously encountered.</p>

<p>The terrorists draw their inspiration from a global message articulated by internationally recognisable figures.</p>

<h3 id="the-threat-from-terrorism-when-overseas">The threat from terrorism when overseas</h3>

<p>Information on threats to personal safety arising from terrorist activities, political unrest, lawlessness, violence, natural disasters, epidemics, anti-British demonstrations and aircraft/shipping safety. It is designed to help you make informed decisions about whether or not to travel to a particular country.</p>

<h3 id="the-threat-of-espionage">The threat of espionage</h3>

<p>The UK is a high priority espionage target and a number of countries are actively seeking UK information and material to advance their own military, technological, political and economic programmes.</p>

<p>For more in depth threat information please contact the Security Advice Centre on 0117 9134 378.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-sal">What is a <abbr title="Security Aspects Letter">SAL</abbr>?</h3>

<p>The ‘SECRET matter’ in an invitation to tender (<abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr>), or contract containing DEFCON 659 must be defined to the contractor in writing. The special obligations laid upon the contractor become legally effective only when the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has issued a notice, in writing, defining which aspects of the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> or contract are to be marked and protected as CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, or TOP SECRET. This is achieved by means of a Security Aspects Letter (<abbr title="Security Aspects Letter">SAL</abbr>) written by the Requisitioning Branch, or by the inclusion of a Security Aspects Clause in the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> or contract.</p>

<p>The contractor is required to confirm in writing that he understands and will implement the terms of the <abbr title="Security Aspects Letter">SAL</abbr> or clause. The <abbr title="Security Aspects Letter">SAL</abbr> is the legal instrument under which a UK contractor may be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act. The <abbr title="Security Aspects Letter">SAL</abbr> must therefore be issued to the contractor with the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> or contract document. DPA-FMG2C3 must be informed in advance if this is not possible. </p>

<h3 id="how-does-my-company-become-list-x">How does my Company become List X?</h3>

<p>‘List X’ is a term that has been in existence for seventy years. In fact it is simply the British term for what the rest of the world knows as ‘FSC - Facility Security Clearance’.</p>

<p>The term refers to contractors or subcontractors which have been formally placed on List X because they are undertaking work marked confidential or above ‘on the Company Premises’. List X is not available on request; it has to be ‘sponsored’ by a Contracting Authority (<abbr title="Contracting authority">CA</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Contracting authority">CA</abbr> can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>An <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> department, probably, but not necessarily, an Integrated Project Team (<abbr title="Integrated Project Team">IPT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>An existing List X company acting as prime contractor to one or more subcontractors (all subcontractors must be approved by the original <abbr title="Contracting authority">CA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Overseas governments and defence contractors</li>
  <li>NATO (please note that NATO does not accept bids from uncleared companies for classified contracts, so <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Industrial Security will initiate List X for UK companies subject to evidence of the intention to bid for a specified NATO contract.)</li>
  <li>A number of other UK government departments, such as the Home Office and Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, including UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), also have their own List X sites, but <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> contracts account for around 85% of List X</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of key requirements for List X status:</p>

<ul>
<li>A contract at confidential or above</li>
  <li>A requirement either for the work to be done on the contractor’s premises or for protectively marked information to be held on site</li>
</ul>
