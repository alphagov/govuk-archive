<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The headquarters of the United Nations Force in Cyprus and the Headquarters British Contingent are located within the United Nations Protected Area (<abbr title="United Nations Protected Area">UNPA</abbr>) on the west side of the city of Nicosia, approximately 5km from the city centre.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Nations Protected Area">UNPA</abbr> is located within the Buffer Zone in the area of the now disused Nicosia international airport. Mostly open scrubland, the area is dotted with small groups of used buildings as well as many disused structures, formerly part of the airport. The Kyrenia mountains can be seen to the north of the <abbr title="United Nations Protected Area">UNPA</abbr> and the Troodos mountains to the south.</p>

<p>The UN controlled buffer zone separates Turkish Controlled Cyprus from the Republic and the UN has maintained peace along the Green Line since 1964. In 1974 it was called upon to patrol and monitor the ceasefire line which runs the length of the country and is more commonly known as the Buffer Zone.</p>

<h2 id="accommodation">Accommodation</h2>

<h3 id="unpa"><abbr title="United Nations Protected Area">UNPA</abbr></h3>

<p>The British Married Patch is located within the <abbr title="United Nations Protected Area">UNPA</abbr> on the west side of the city of Nicosia, approximately 5km from the city centre. The <abbr title="United Nations Protected Area">UNPA</abbr> is within the Buffer Zone. Due to its quiet location well away from main roads, the married patch is a very safe environment for children of all ages.</p>

<h3 id="married-family-quarters">Married Family Quarters</h3>

<p>MFQs in Cyprus are serviced by a housing office which is located on the edge of the patch. Houses are fully furnished, including carpets and curtains, but are not supplied with cutlery, crockery, glassware or bedding. It is possible to return items of MOD furnishings to the housing stores (as well as request additional pieces, if available).</p>

<h3 id="accommodation-at-unpa--6-month-unaccompanied-personnel">Accommodation at <abbr title="United Nations Protected Area">UNPA</abbr> – 6 month unaccompanied personnel</h3>

<p>All 6-month unaccompanied personnel accommodation is based in Blue Beret Camp on the <abbr title="United Nations Protected Area">UNPA</abbr>. A typical accommodation block consists of 8 single rooms, a communal living area and communal washrooms. There is a separate block with washing machines and tumble dryers.</p>

<p>Each single room consists of a bed with under drawers, a bedside cabinet, a table and chair and a metal locker. The communal living area has a television, microwave, fridge freezer, iron and board and kitchen area with sink.</p>

<h2 id="medical-facilities">Medical facilities</h2>

<h3 id="medical-care-for-serving-personnel">Medical care for serving personnel</h3>

<p>All serving personnel are entitled to care and treatment at the De-Vergara Medical Centre at Blue Beret Camp, within <abbr title="United Nations Protected Area">UNPA</abbr>. The medical centre is staffed by one doctor (supplied by the Argentinean Contingent) and two British QARANC nurses, of which at least one is female.</p>

<p>The medical centre is staffed from 7.30am to 3.30pm and outside these hours the duty nurse can be reached by mobile - 99-428152. There is a daily sick parade from 8am to 9am for soldiers and 10am to 11.30am for senior ranks and officers.</p>

<p>In the event that the medical centre cannot provide the necessary treatment, referral will be made to one of the UN contracted hospitals in Nicosia or to one of the Sovereign Base Area medical centres in Dhekelia or Episkopi.</p>

<p>In the event that the medical centre cannot provide the necessary treatment, referral will be made to one of the UN contracted hospitals in Nicosia or to one of the Sovereign Base Area medical centers in Dhekelia or Episkopi.</p>
