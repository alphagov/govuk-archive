<p><strong>You can get your property checked to see what a Green Deal can do for you - but any work can’t start until January 2013.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>You can make energy-saving improvements to your home or business without having to pay all the costs up front through the Green Deal. </p>

<p>Energy-saving improvements include things like: </p>

<ul>
<li>insulation - eg loft or cavity wall insulation</li>
  <li>boilers </li>
  <li>draught-proofing</li>
  <li>double glazing</li>
  <li>renewable energy technologies - eg solar panels or wind turbines</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Green Deal works</h2>

<p>The basic steps are: </p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Choose a <a href="http://www.greendealorb.co.uk/assessors/assessor-search" title="Find a Green Deal assessor" rel="external">Green Deal assessor</a> - they’ll write a report on your property telling you what improvements you can make and estimate how much you could save on your energy bills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a <a href="http://www.greendealorb.co.uk/providers/provider-search" title="Find a Green Deal provider" rel="external">Green Deal provider</a> to carry out the work. They must explain what work will be done and how much it will cost - this is known as a ‘Green Deal plan’. How much you can spend is up to the Green Deal provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you go ahead with the improvements you must sign your Green Deal Plan - this is a contract between you and the provider. The provider will then arrange for a Green Deal installer to do the work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Costs</h2>

<p>Check if the assessor’s assessment is free or if there is a fee. </p>

<p>You pay in instalments through your electricity bill. The actual amount will be shown on your Green Deal plan. You may get help with the costs if you’re on benefits, a low income or living in an older property.</p>

<p>Usually your bills won’t go up because you shouldn’t pay back more than the savings you’re making as a result of the improvements. The actual savings depend on your energy use and the future cost of energy. </p>

<p>You can be charged interest on your repayments and there may be penalties if you repay the money early. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Before you sign your Green Deal plan - check you understand the repayment rules.</p>
