<p>HIVE information centres support the chain of command and service communities through the provision of up-to-date and relevant information.</p>

<p>The HIVE is an information network available to all members of the Service community. It serves both married and single personnel, together with their families, dependants and civilians employed by the Services. </p>

<p>Worldwide, the HIVE information centres offer an extensive range of information on relocation, local unit and civilian facilities, places of interest, schools and further education, housing, healthcare facilities, employment and training opportunities. </p>

<p>We network worldwide, sourcing national and local information as needed. Information on relocations is one of our key areas of information support and is available either in advance or on arrival at the receiving unit. Information on the ways to communicate with those serving away on operational deployments is also available through our HIVE information centres.</p>

<p>HIVE information support officers are not trained in welfare counselling. We are however able to advise referral to those professional agencies best suited to the individual’s circumstances. All HIVE staff are bound to a code of confidentiality.</p>

<p>We are proud that our service is recognised and valued across the armed forces for its professional approach, initiative and commitment to you, the Service community.</p>

<h2 id="overseas-hive---brunei">Overseas HIVE - Brunei</h2>
<p>Serving Istana Grove, Avenue and Gardens, Tuker Lines and SSFA.</p>

<p>Brunei is situated on the North West coast of the Island of Borneo. Its 100 mile coastline faces the South China Sea and it covers a total area of 2226 sq miles, less than a quarter the size of the UK. It has a common border with Sarawak in the South and West, and with Sabah in the North East. Both Sarawak and Sabah are Eastern states of Malaysia on the island of Borneo.</p>

<p>The country’s full name is Negara Brunei Darussalam, which is usually translated to ‘Brunei - the Abode of Peace’. Brunei is 8 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in winter and 7 hours ahead in summer. The country’s capital Bandar Seri Begawan is in the Brunei-Muara district, approximately 1½ hours drive from Seria where the Garrison is located. There is much to explore in Brunei from the impressive mosques and sprawling stilt villages to taking a short trek through Temburong National Park.</p>

<p>The Garrison consists of 4 sites: Sittang Camp, just outside Tutong in the middle of the country, Scout Base housing 7 Flight AAC, Medicina Lines where the Garrison Support Services are located and Tuker Lines where the Garrison Headquarters and Resident Battalion reside. The latter 3 camps are located just outside Seria, in the Belait district of Brunei, just a 15 min drive from Kuala Belait the districts main town.</p>

<p>A well-equipped gymnasium, basketball, badminton and volleyball courts are available on Tuker Lines. The Garrison has a swimming pool and a dive club. The community centre located in the Istana Grove SFA, consists of a library, Café, splash pool, patio bar and the HIVE. The Hornbill School Foundation Stage and Jungle Cubs nursery are also located in this area.</p>

<h2 id="hive-support-during-deployments">HIVE support during deployments</h2>

<p>HIVE provides support to deployed personnel and their families through the provision of information about available support, services and communication. Ask your nearest HIVE for the HIVE operational deployment leaflets which give full details of all the support it can give you during deployments. There are also deployment guides available for families of deployed personnel.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-in-touch-during-deployments">Keeping in touch during deployments</h3>

<p>What can your HIVE do for you?</p>

<ul>
<li>Assist in setting up an ArmyNET or E-bluey account</li>
  <li>Find your nearest fax-bluey machine</li>
  <li>Keep you up to date with local activities and events</li>
</ul>
<p>Listed below are the various ways of keeping in touch during deployments and your HIVE will provide further information if you need it.</p>

<h3 id="british-forces-post-office-bfpo">British Forces Post Office (<abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>)</h3>

<p>By post - The Enduring Free Mail Service can be used by family and friends in the UK and at <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> addresses worldwide to send packets free to named Service personnel and MOD deployed civilians in authorised operational theatres. Customers who are posting letters, cards and packets up to 2kg in weight using the Enduring Free Mail Service to Op HERRICK and HM Ships in support must ensure that these items are physically handed over to a counter clerk at a UK Crown/Sub Post Office or overseas <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>. Certain items are prohibited and these are listed in the <a href="/british-forces-post-office-services"><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> guide</a>.</p>

<p>Parcels must be addressed using the following format:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Service No Rank Name
<br>Unit/Regt
<br>Operation Name
<br><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> No
<br></p></div></div>

<p>The town and country must not be included in the address.</p>

<p>Most operational BFPOs are included in the enduring free parcel scheme. A full list of <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> numbers and further information on this service is available in the <a href="/british-forces-post-office-services"><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> guide</a> or by contacting the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> enquiries team on telephone: 08457 69 79 78.  </p>

<p>Blueys - a hand-written letter which can be sent free to deployed personnel. Blueys can be obtained free from your HIVE or Welfare Office and also from your local Post Office. </p>

<p>E-blueys - A two-way method of communication that can be used by anyone with access to the internet. Deployed personnel, family and friends can compose an e-bluey and once they hit ‘send’, their letter is sent via an automated system to the recipient. The letter is received by the specialist Forces Post Office system, printed, enveloped and sealed before onward transmission. E-blueys are private, and they combine the speed of electronic communication with the personal touch of a letter.  Your HIVE can assist you in setting up an e-bluey account.</p>

<p>Fax-Blueys - A free service provided by <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> available through some HIVEs to send a scanned handwritten letter or picture over the internet. Where a Fax-bluey machine is available, handwritten letters (written on special Fax-bluey paper available from the HIVE or the Unit Welfare Office) can be sent to deployed personnel with the same speed and privacy as an e-Bluey. The Fax-Bluey machine scans and sends the letter via an electronic system that prints, folds and seals it in theatre before delivery to the recipient.  </p>
