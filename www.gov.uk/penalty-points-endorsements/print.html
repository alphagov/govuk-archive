</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re convicted of a motoring offence, the courts can fine you and ‘endorse’ your driving licence with penalty points.</p>

<p>Endorsements must stay on your driving licence for 4 or 11 years depending on the offence.</p>

<p>The endorsement (and penalty points) is put on your driver record and is written on the counterpart document of your photocard driving licence or on your paper driving licence.</p>

<p>If you build up 12 or more penalty points within a period of 3 years, you can be be <a href="/driving-disqualifications" title="disqualified from driving">disqualified from driving</a>.</p>

</article><article id="endorsement-codes-and-penalty-points"><header><h1>Part 2: Endorsement codes and penalty points</h1>
  </header><p>Each endorsement has a special code and is allocated ‘penalty points’ on a scale from 1 to 11, depending on how severe the offence is.</p>

<p>The penalty points and other penalties for different traffic offences are set out in the <a href="/highway-code" title="Highway Code">Highway Code</a>.</p>

<p>If you build up 6 or more penalty points within 2 years of passing your first driving test you’ll automatically lose your licence.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll have to apply and pay for a new provisional licence and pass both theory and practical parts of the driving test again to get a full licence.</p>

<h2>When you’ve passed your re-test</h2>

<p>You won’t lose your licence again if you run up another 6 points. But if you get more than 12 points in 3 years, you’ll normally lose your licence for at least 6 months.</p>

<h2>Penalty points on your provisional licence</h2>

<p>You can also get penalty points on your provisional licence before you pass your test. These points last for 3 years. If you then get more points after passing your test taking the total to 6 you’ll lose your licence. </p>

<p>If you reach 6 points before you’ve taken your test, you won’t lose your provisional licence. But if you get any more points within 2 years of passing your test, you’ll lose your licence.</p>

<h2>Who’s covered by the new drivers rules</h2>

<p>These rules apply to all new drivers who passed their first driving test in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Great Britain</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland</li>
