<h2 id="overview-of-the-employment-advice-service-for-leavers">Overview of the employment advice service for leavers</h2>

<p>The MInistry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) has a partnership agreement with Right Management, the global career development and outplacement specialists. This helps eligible personnel leaving the Armed Forces to make a successful transition to civilian employment in a suitable second career which is appropriate to their skills, knowledge and aspirations. </p>

<p>The Career Transition Partnership (<abbr title="Career Transition Partnership">CTP</abbr>) incorporates 9 regional resettlement centres in the UK, 1 in Germany and 1 in Nepal. The resettlement training centre is based in Aldershot. All offices are linked to a central database of service leavers, employers and jobs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Career Transition Partnership">CTP</abbr> staff understand the military way of life and the challenges facing people making the transition to civilian life.</p>

<p>Although primarily focused on helping service leavers to find suitable employment in a second career, the service also includes preparations for civilian life for those who are planning to retire or going into full time education.</p>

<p>Support is available from 2 years prior to discharge and up until 2 years after discharge.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Career Transition Partnership">CTP</abbr> administers a high quality, free recruitment service for employers seeking the best. This includes an online vacancy database, employment fairs around the UK, and a team of employment consultants who are available to advise and assist with employer’s recruitment needs.</p>

<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>

<p>Everyone on the trained strength is eligible to see a 1st and 2nd line officer for information and advice on resettlement at any time during their careers. To be eligible for 3rd line services under the <abbr title="Career Transition Partnership">CTP</abbr> provided by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s Partner, there are 2 levels of entry depending upon the length of service.</p>

<ol>
<li>Those who have completed 4 years or more service are entitled to an employment support programme (<abbr title="employment support programme">ESP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Those who have completed 6 years or more are entitled to the full service</li>
</ol>
<p>Service leavers who have completed 6 years or more are also eligible for an amount of time, known as graduated resettlement time (<abbr title="graduated resettlement time">GRT</abbr>) which can be used to undertake resettlement activities. This is 4 weeks for those have 6 years but rises to 7 weeks for those who have completed 16 years or more. They are also eligible for a grant, the individual resettlement training costs (<abbr title="individual resettlement training costs">IRTC</abbr>) grant, which can be used towards meeting the costs of training during resettlement. They will also receive travel and subsistence support for resettlement activities taken as part of <abbr title="graduated resettlement time">GRT</abbr>.</p>

<p>All service leavers also have access to briefs on housing advice, provided by the Joint Service Housing Advice Organisation (<abbr title="Joint Service Housing Advice Organisation">JSHAO</abbr>).</p>

<h2 id="employment-support-programme">Employment support programme</h2>

<p>The employment support programme (<abbr title="employment support programme">ESP</abbr>) service is available, through the <abbr title="Career Transition Partnership">CTP</abbr> to service leavers who have completed four years service, from six months before discharge up until two years post discharge. Each service leaver is assigned an individual career consultant from either the Regular Forces Employment Agency (<abbr title="Regular Forces Employment Agency">RFEA</abbr>), or, in the case of an officer, the Officer Association (<abbr title="Officer Association">OA</abbr>). The consultant will provide detailed advice on the types of service which the individual may be suitable for in the region to which he or she intends to relocate. </p>

<p>The service leaver will also have access to a comprehensive database of jobs, many of which are available exclusively to service leavers, and the consultant will help them in making contact with prospective employers. The consultant will also give advice on other regional matters such as schooling, housing and so forth. Because the <abbr title="Regular Forces Employment Agency">RFEA</abbr> and <abbr title="Officer Association">OA</abbr> have charitable status, an ex-service person can also go to them after 2 years post-discharge and receive the services for the rest of their working lives.</p>

<h2 id="full-resettlement-service">Full resettlement service</h2>

<p>The full service is available through the <abbr title="Career Transition Partnership">CTP</abbr> for those service leavers who have completed 6 years service or more and commences up to two years before discharge until two year post discharge. The services provided include:</p>

<ul>
<li>allocation of a personal career consultant, with whom the service service leaver can have unlimited face-to-face contact</li>
  <li>various workshops, which will assist a service leaver in producing a CV, researching the job market, preparing for an interview and responding to job adverts. There are also options which give guidance to those service leavers who intend to retire after leaving the Armed Forces</li>
  <li>access to training so that transferable skills which service leavers develop during their time in the Armed Forces can lead to equivalent civilian qualifications</li>
  <li>access to the <abbr title="employment support programme">ESP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resettlement-training">Resettlement training</h2>

<p>Training may be undertaken internally at a specialist training centre for military personnel (the Resettlement Training Centre (<abbr title="Resettlement Training Centre">RTC</abbr>), Aldershot), where a range of training courses are on offer. The centre has management studies, engineering and building trades departments.</p>

<p>The management studies department offers courses for potential bursars, police officers, project managers, facilities managers and so forth. The Engineering Department offers courses on security, health and safety, electrical installation, IT and so forth. The Building Trades Department offers courses in bricklaying, carpentry &amp; joinery, painting and decorating, plumbing, plastering, dry lining, texturing and tiling. All are excellent value for money and almost all can be paid for from service leavers’ <abbr title="individual resettlement training costs">IRTC</abbr> grant. Many lead to civilian-recognised qualifications.</p>

<p>Service leavers may also undertake training through a network of external, civilian training organisations, known as preferred suppliers which are audited by the <abbr title="Resettlement Training Centre">RTC</abbr> Aldershot to ensure value for money.</p>

<h2 id="medical-discharges">Medical discharges</h2>

<p>A range of special services are available for medical discharges. They are all entitled to the <abbr title="individual resettlement training costs">IRTC</abbr> grant, <abbr title="graduated resettlement time">GRT</abbr> and <abbr title="Career Transition Partnership">CTP</abbr> services, irrespective of the length of time that they have served, including if they are discharged whilst under training. There is also a fast track programme for them because the length of time between being informed of the decision to discharge and discharge itself is often quite short. For those who are not able to undertake resettlement services because of their medical condition, it is possible to defer resettlement for up to 2 years after discharge and, in extreme cases, resettlement provision may be transferred to the spouse of the the service leaver.</p>

<h2 id="early-service-leavers">Early service leavers</h2>

<p>Personnel who are discharged while under training, or those personnel who are discharged compulsorily, are eligible for a reduced resettlement provision. These personnel, known as early service leavers, are often discharged at very short notice and so are directed or signposted, to the help and guidance that they can receive from other government departments and ex-service welfare organisations and charities. </p>

<p>All early service leavers will be given a comprehensive resettlement brief and a detailed one to one interview by an officer, or someone with equivalent status, at unit level. During this interview issues specific to the individual will be explored and he or she will be put in touch with the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), though its Jobcentre Plus offices, which will be able to give help, guidance and advice in finding a job once the early service leaver has discharged.</p>

<p>Contact will also be made on behalf of the early service leaver with the <abbr title="Joint Service Housing Advice Organisation">JSHAO</abbr> or the Single Persons Accommodation Centre for the Ex-services (<abbr title="Single Persons Accommodation Centre for the Ex-services">SPACES</abbr>), if there are accommodation issues involved, and/or the ex-service charities where appropriate. For those who are identified as requiring further help whilst in service, they may be referred to a service resettlement advisor or to a specialist <abbr title="Career Transition Partnership">CTP</abbr> consultant for a one off interview, to explore specific issues further and for guidance on more specialist help available outside of the services once discharged.</p>
