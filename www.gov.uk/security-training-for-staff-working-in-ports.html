<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you manage a port facility in the UK, you will need to appoint a Port Facility Security Officer (<abbr title="Port Facility Security Officer">PFSO</abbr>). This is a requirement under the International Ship and Port Facility Code (ISPS Code). The code is implemented in the UK through the Ship and Port Facility (Security) Regulations 2004, as amended.</p>

<p><abbr title="Port Facility Security Officers">PFSOs</abbr> will need to be appointed to cover each port facility, although a single officer may have responsibility for more than one facility. The definition of a ‘port facility’ includes areas such as anchorages, waiting berths and approaches from seaward. This can range from a large sea freight terminal to an individual berth or wharf.</p>

<p>Any <abbr title="Port Facility Security Officer">PFSO</abbr> you appoint must complete a training course delivered by a training provider approved by the Transport Security and Contingencies (<abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr>) directorate at the Department for Transport.</p>

<p>You will also need to provide training for staff carrying out security functions. You should consider providing general security awareness training to other, non-security staff working at the port facility.</p>

<p>This guide explains how to find <abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr>-approved <abbr title="Port Facility Security Officer">PFSO</abbr> trainers. It will point you towards <abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr>’s training resources for security staff and other employees at ports, and explain how your staff can attend its maritime security roadshows.</p>

<h2 id="port-facility-security-officer-training">Port Facility Security Officer training</h2>

<p>All <abbr title="Port Facility Security Officers">PFSOs</abbr> in the UK must attend a training course run by a provider approved by the Transport Security and Contingencies (<abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr>) directorate at the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>.</p>

<p>The aim of the training is to provide an appointed <abbr title="Port Facility Security Officer">PFSO</abbr> with the knowledge and skills needed to comply with the rules and regulations set out in the ISPS Code.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/pfso-approved-training-providers">List of approved <abbr title="Port Facility Security Officer">PFSO</abbr> training providers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="non-approved-training">Non-approved training</h3>

<p>Some training companies who have not been accredited and have not sought approval from <abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr> are currently offering <abbr title="Port Facility Security Officer">PFSO</abbr> course training to ports and port facilities.</p>

<p><abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr> does not recognise certification or approval from any training provider other than those listed on the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> website. If the <abbr title="Port Facility Security Officer">PFSO</abbr> you have appointed has already attended a course delivered by an unapproved training provider, they may need to attend further courses from an approved provider on the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> list.</p>

<p>You should contact <abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr> if you have been approached by an unapproved training provider.</p>

<h3 id="getting-approved-as-a-training-provider">Getting approved as a training provider</h3>

<p>If you want to deliver <abbr title="Port Facility Security Officer">PFSO</abbr> training courses, you can find out how to apply for <abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr> approval by writing to:</p>

<h2 id="training-material-from-the-dft-covering-port-security-training">Training material from the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> covering port security training</h2>

<p>If you manage staff that work in and around ports and ships, you can use training resources from the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> as part of your security training programme.</p>

<p>As well as resources for training staff with specific security duties, the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> also provides material for the general security awareness training of all staff.</p>

<p>Training films</p>

<p>You can order training films from the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> covering the following specific maritime security topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Safe Harbours: Port Security and You - suitable for induction training of all staff working in ports</li>
  <li>Maritime Freight Security - for security staff working in passenger (PAX) or container roll-on roll-off (CRR) port facilities</li>
  <li>Security: Everybody’s Business - intended to assist with the security awareness training of ships’ crews</li>
</ul>
<p>These films are supplied free of charge to UK port operators and companies operating UK-registered ships.</p>

<p>Other training films which are not specific to the maritime environment but cover the provision of effective security measures are also available.</p>

<h3 id="learning-packages">Learning packages</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> also provides hard copy training materials for maritime security.</p>

<ul>
<li>Training for port security staff - a set of voluntary training modules intended for the initial training and refresher training of security staff which cover all the requirements set out in the port facility security instructions issued by the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Drills and exercises guidance - a document that acts as an ‘aide memoire’ and provides basic guidance to those involved in organising maritime security drills and exercises</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="maritime-security-roadshows-run-by-dft">Maritime security roadshows run by <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Maritime security roadshows are one-day events aimed at all staff working on ships - particularly passenger vessels - and in port environments.</p>

<p>The roadshows are run jointly by <abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr> directorate at the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and the Security Service. They are held throughout the year, usually in port locations.</p>

<p>Dates are set aside each year by <abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr> for the roadshows. Individual ports and shipping companies are then invited to submit bids in writing to host a roadshow on a particular date. These are usually accepted on a ‘first come, first served’ basis.</p>

<p>The roadshows are provided free of charge, but if you are hosting one you will be asked to provide certain facilities, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>lecture rooms</li>
  <li>TV, video and projection facilities</li>
  <li>refreshments, including a buffet lunch, for delegates and presenters</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-happens-during-the-day">What happens during the day</h3>

<p>The day’s programme typically includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>information on the threat to passenger shipping operations</li>
  <li>a brief overview of the relevant legislation</li>
  <li>an introduction to the devices, weapons and tactics used by terrorist groups</li>
  <li>an explanation of the role of <abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr> and how it monitors compliance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-host-or-attend-a-roadshow">How to host or attend a roadshow</h3>

<p>A minimum of 20 delegates is normally required for each roadshow.</p>

<p>If you are interested in hosting an event, you should contact <abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr> Maritime Security on 020 7944 2844 for available dates and details of how to bid.</p>

<p>You should also contact <abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr> if you have staff that would benefit from attending a roadshow, but insufficient numbers to host your own event. It may be possible for <abbr title="Transport Security and Contingencies">TRANSEC</abbr> to make arrangements for your staff to attend somebody else’s event, provided that the hosting organisation agrees to this.</p>
