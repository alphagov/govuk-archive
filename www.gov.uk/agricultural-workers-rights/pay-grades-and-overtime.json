Work out the number of weeks from 1 October to the day before you start your holiday.   \r\ns2. Work out the number of qualifying days in that time.  \r\ns3. Divide the number of qualifying days by the number of weeks in step 1 - this gives you\u00a0the number of days you worked each week.  \r\ns4. Work out your annual leave entitlement using the above table.\r\n\r\n\r\n$E\r\n**Example**\r\n  \r\nBefore going on leave, you work for 25 weeks.\r\n\r\nIn that time you've worked 125 days, taken 2 days' sick leave and taken statutory paternity leave of 10 days.  \r\n\r\nDivide total qualifying days (137) by weeks worked (25)  = 5.48 days worked on average per week.  \r\n \r\nAnnual leave entitlement = **35 days**.  \r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n##Incomplete leave years\r\n\r\nIf you've not been employed by the same employer for an entire leave year, you'll need to calculate your annual leave differently.\r\n\r\ns1. use the table above to work out what your annual leave would be for a year\r\ns2. work out the number of weeks you've worked continuously\r\ns3. divide the number of weeks you have worked continuously by 52\r\ns4. multiply the number of days from step one, by the answer to step three\r\n\r\nThis gives you the amount of leave you have.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n**Example**\r\n  \r\nYou work more than 5 days but less than 6 days a week = 35 annual leave.\r\n\r\nYou've worked for 30 weeks continuously.\r\n\r\n30 weeks divided by 52 = 0.576.\r\n\r\n35 days multiplied by 0.576 = **20 days**.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n##Bank holidays\r\n\r\nBank holidays are included in your annual leave entitlement.\r\n\r\nIf a public holiday falls on a day you normally work, your employer can either ask you:\r\n\r\n- not to work - the day is an annual leave day\r\n- to work - you should be paid overtime for the hours you worked (the day remains as annual leave to be taken in the future)\r\n\r\n\r\n","slug":"holiday-leave-and-pay","title":"Holiday leave and pay"}},{"table":{"body":"For advice on your rights as an agricultural worker you can contact the Pay and Work Rights Helpline.\r\n\r\n$C\r\n**Pay and Work Rights Helpline**  \r\n**Telephone**: 0800 917 2368  \r\n**Textphone**: 0800 121 4042  \r\nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm  \r\n$C\r\n\r\nYou can also complete an [enquiry form.](https://payandworkrights.direct.gov.uk/ \"Pay and Work Rights enquiry form\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\n##Complaints about your employer\r\nYou can complete a [complaints form.](https://payandworkrights.direct.gov.uk/complaints/ \"Pay and Work Rights complaints form\"){:rel=\"external\"}","slug":"pay-and-work-rights-helpline","title":"Pay and Work Rights Helpline"}}],"type":"guide"}
