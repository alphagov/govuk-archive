  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you work in agriculture, some of your employment rights are different from other workers.</p>

<p>Before you begin work, your employer must give you an Agricultural Wage Order. This states the terms and conditions of your employment.</p>

<p>You’re normally entitled to:</p>

<ul>
<li>overtime pay</li>
  <li>paid holiday</li>
  <li>Agricultural Sick Pay</li>
  <li>bad weather pay</li>
  <li>night work pay</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a trainee, your rights are different -  eg you do not get paid holidays. Speak to your employer or contact the <a href="pay-and-work-rights-helpline" title="Pay and Work Rights Helpline">Pay and Work Rights Helpline</a>.</p>

<h2>Rest breaks</h2>
<p>If you’re aged 18 and over and work more than 5½ hours per day, you’re entitled to an unpaid 30-minute rest break. </p>

<p>It should be: </p>

<ul>
<li>uninterrupted</li>
  <li>spent away from your immediate place of work</li>
  <li>not be taken at the beginning or the end of the working day</li>
</ul>
<h2>Agricultural Sick Pay</h2>

<p>To qualify for <a href="/agricultural-sick-pay" title="Agricultural Sick Pay">Agricultural Sick Pay</a> you must have been continuously employed by the same employer for at least 52 weeks. </p>

<h2>Bad weather pay</h2>
<p>If bad weather stops you from working, and your employer can’t give you other work, you should still be paid.</p>

<h2>If you work for a gangmaster</h2>
<p>You might work for an agency classed as a ‘gangmaster’. Most need a licence from the Gangmasters Licensing Authority.</p>

<p>You can check if a <a rel="external" href="http://gla.defra.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1012772" title="Gangmasters Licensing Authority">gangmaster holds a licence.</a></p>

<p>There are some circumstances when a gangmaster doesn’t need a licence. You can find out more:</p>

<ul>
<li>from the <a rel="external" href="http://gla.defra.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1013276" title="Gangmasters Licensing Authority">Gangmasters Licensing Authority</a> </li>
  <li>by contacting the <a href="pay-and-work-rights-helpline" title="Pay and Work Rights Helpline">Pay and Work Rights Helpline</a>
</li>

<h2>Overtime</h2>

<p>You should be paid overtime if you work:</p>

<ul>
<li>more than 39 basic hours in a week</li>
  <li>more than 8 hours in a day</li>
  <li>any hours over the normal working hours in your employment contract</li>
  <li>on a public or bank holiday</li>
  <li>on a Sunday - if your contract started before 1 October 2006</li>
</ul>
<h2>Being paid on completing a task</h2>

<p>If you’re paid by the tasks you complete - eg per carton of picked fruit - your wage should not be less than the <abbr title="Agricultural Minimum Wage">AMW</abbr> (including overtime) for the hours you work.</p>

<h2>Night work</h2>

<p>Night work is any work done between 7pm and 6am. Your employer must pay you £1.33 per hour more than your basic pay rate.</p>

<h2>Dog allowance</h2>
<p>If you keep 1 or more dogs for your job, you’re entitled to £7.42 per week per dog.</p>

<h2>If you’re given somewhere to live as part of your job</h2>
<p>If your employer provides you with a house or ‘self-contained accommodation’ - they can deduct £1.50 per week from your <abbr title="Agricultural Minimum Wage">AMW</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you live in accommodation that isn’t a house - eg a caravan - they can deduct £4.73 for each day the accommodation is provided.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your accommodation must be safe, warm, secure - and have toilet and washing facilities and fresh drinking water.</p>

</article><article id="holiday-leave-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 4: Holiday leave and pay</h1>
  </header><p>The annual leave year starts on 1 October and ends on 30 September the following year.</p>

<p>The amount of leave you can take depends on the number of days you work each week.</p>

<p>Below is the annual leave entitlement for workers who work a complete annual leave year for the same employer.</p>

<table>

<p>Guaranteed overtime hours can be included in the number of days you work each week as long as:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have to work them as part of your contract</li>
  <li>you’re paid for this overtime even if there’s no work for you to do </li>
</ul>
<p>Any other overtime that you work can’t be counted.</p>

<h2>If you work a different number of days a week</h2>

<p>If you work a different number of days each week you need to calculate your annual leave entitlement separately.</p>

<p>‘Qualifying days’ are the number of days you work (including guaranteed overtime) or take:</p>

<ul>
<li>annual leave</li>
  <li>statutory ordinary adoption leave</li>
  <li>statutory ordinary maternity leave</li>
  <li>statutory paternity leave</li>
  <li>sick leave (paid or unpaid)</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate your leave entitlement you should:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Work out the number of weeks from 1 October to the day before you start your holiday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out the number of qualifying days in that time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide the number of qualifying days by the number of weeks in step 1 - this gives you the number of days you worked each week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out your annual leave entitlement using the above table.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Before going on leave, you work for 25 weeks.</p>

<p>In that time you’ve worked 125 days, taken 2 days’ sick leave and taken statutory paternity leave of 10 days.  </p>

<p>Divide total qualifying days (137) by weeks worked (25)  = 5.48 days worked on average per week.  </p>

<p>Annual leave entitlement = <strong>35 days</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Incomplete leave years</h2>

<p>If you’ve not been employed by the same employer for an entire leave year, you’ll need to calculate your annual leave differently.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>use the table above to work out what your annual leave would be for a year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work out the number of weeks you’ve worked continuously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>divide the number of weeks you have worked continuously by 52</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multiply the number of days from step one, by the answer to step three</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This gives you the amount of leave you have.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>You work more than 5 days but less than 6 days a week = 35 annual leave.</p>

<p>You’ve worked for 30 weeks continuously.</p>

<p>30 weeks divided by 52 = 0.576.</p>

<p>35 days multiplied by 0.576 = <strong>20 days</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Bank holidays</h2>

<p>Bank holidays are included in your annual leave entitlement.</p>

<p>If a public holiday falls on a day you normally work, your employer can either ask you:</p>

<ul>
<li>not to work - the day is an annual leave day</li>
  <li>to work - you should be paid overtime for the hours you worked (the day remains as annual leave to be taken in the future)</li>
