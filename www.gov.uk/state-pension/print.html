  </header><p>The basic State Pension is a regular payment from the government that you can get when you reach <a href="/calculate-state-pension" title="State Pension age calculator">State Pension age</a>.</p>

<p>To get it you must have paid or been credited with National Insurance contributions. </p>

<p>The most you can currently get is £107.45 per week. </p>

<ul>
<li>earnings - the average percentage growth in wages (in Great Britain)</li>
  <li>prices - the percentage growth in prices in the UK as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (<abbr title="Consumer Prices Index">CPI</abbr>) </li>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>The maximum you can get is £107.45 per week.</p>

<p>If you’re married or in a civil partnership and expect your basic State Pension to be below £64.40 per week you could top it up to that amount but there are <a href="/state-pension/eligibility" title="Eligibility">qualifying rules</a>.</p>

<p>You may have to <a href="/tax-national-insurance-after-state-pension-age/tax-on-your-state-pension-and-other-income" title="Paying tax on your State Pension">pay tax on your basic State Pension</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/calculate-state-pension" title="State Pension calculator">State Pension calculator</a> to get a quick estimate or apply for a detailed <a href="/state-pension-statement" title="State Pension statement">State Pension statement</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You might also qualify for the <a href="/additional-state-pension" title="Additional State Pension">Additional State Pension</a> or, if you’re on a low income, <a href="/pension-credit" title="Pension Credit">Pension Credit</a>.</p>

<h2>How it’s paid</h2>
<p>The basic State Pension is usually paid 4-weekly into an account of your choice. </p>

<p>There are different rules <a href="/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/how-to-claim" title="State Pension if you live abroad">if you live abroad</a>.</p>


</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>The earliest you can get the basic State Pension is when you reach <a href="/calculate-state-pension" title="calculate state pension age">State Pension age</a>.</p>

<p>Your basic State Pension depends on the number of years you’ve paid <a href="/national-insurance/overview" title="National Insurance">National Insurance</a> or got <a href="/boost-state-pension/overview" title="National Insurance credits">National Insurance credits</a>, eg while unemployed or claiming certain benefits.</p>

<p>To qualify for a basic State Pension at least one of the following must apply to you:</p>

<ul>
<li>you were working and paying National Insurance  </li>
  <li>you were getting certain benefits, eg for unemployment, sickness </li>
  <li>you were a parent or carer and claiming certain benefits or credits </li>
  <li>you have a spouse or civil partner whose National Insurance contributions cover you </li>
  <li>you were paying voluntary National Insurance contributions </li>
</ul>
<p>To get the full basic State Pension you need 30 years worth of contributions or credits. These are your ‘qualifying years’. If you have fewer than 30 years your State Pension will be less than £107.45 per week. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/calculate-state-pension" title="state pension calculator">State Pension calculator</a> to find out how many qualifying years you already have and what your State Pension would be now.</p>
</div>

<h2>You’re working</h2>
<p>When you’re working you pay National Insurance and get qualifying years if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re employed and earning over £5,564</li>
  <li>you’re self-employed and paying National Insurance contributions </li>
</ul>
<h2>You’re not working</h2>

<p>In some circumstances the government will give you <a href="/boost-state-pension/overview" title="National Insurance credits">‘National Insurance credits’</a> that count towards your basic State Pension.</p>

<p>Since April 2010 - you get credits if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you care for a child under 12</li>
  <li>you care for someone sick or disabled</li>
  <li>you are a registered foster carer</li>
  <li>you get Carer’s Allowance</li>
</ul>
<p>Before April 2010 - you got credits under Home Responsibilities Protection if any of the following applied:</p>

<ul>
<li>you claimed Child Benefit for a child under 16</li>
  <li>you cared for someone sick or disabled</li>
  <li>you worked as a registered carer</li>
</ul>
<p>You also got credits if you were on Carer’s Allowance or you might get <a href="/boost-state-pension/eligibility" title="Specified Adult Childcare credits">Specified Adult Childcare credits</a>.</p>

<h2>Married or in a civil partnership</h2>
<p>If you’re not eligible for a basic State Pension or not getting the full amount, you might be able to qualify or ‘top up’ to £64.40 through your spouse’s or civil partner’s National Insurance contributions if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have both reached State Pension age </li>
  <li>your spouse or civil partner qualifies for some basic State Pension (even if they haven’t claimed it)</li>
  <li>your wife or civil partner was born after 6 April 1950 (married men and civil partners only)</li>
</ul>
<p>You do this through <a href="/state-pension/how-to-claim" title="claim your State Pension">claiming your State Pension.</a> </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can no longer get the Adult Dependency Increase for someone who is looking after children or financially dependent on you. If you got it on or before 5 April 2010 you’ll keep it until 5 April 2020 provided you’re eligible until then.</p>
</div>

<h2>You don’t qualify for a full State Pension</h2>
<p>If you’re not covered by any of these groups but want a State Pension you might be able to <a href="/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions/why-pay-voluntary-contributions" title="voluntary National Insurance contributions">pay voluntary National Insurance contributions</a>. You might also be able to top up if you don’t have 30 qualifying years and want to increase the amount you get.</p>

<h2>Men born before 1945 and women born before 1950</h2>

<p>You need more qualifying years to get a full State Pension and a certain minimum number of years to get any State Pension at all. </p>

<h2>You want to keep working</h2>
<p>You can claim your State Pension even if you carry on working. However, you have the <a href="/deferring-state-pension/what-you-may-get" title="defer claiming your State Pension">option to defer</a> which can increase the amount you get. </p>

</article><article id="further-information"><header><h1>Part 5: Further information</h1>
  </header><h2>Your circumstances change</h2>
<p>You must <a href="/contact-pension-service" title="Contact the Pension Service">tell the Pension Service</a> if anything in your circumstances changes, eg if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>move home </li>
  <li>go into or come out of hospital </li>
  <li>move abroad or return to the UK </li>
  <li>go into a care home </li>
  <li>marry or form a civil partnership </li>
  <li>get divorced or have your civil partnership dissolved</li>
  <li>are widowed or your civil partner dies </li>
</ul>
<h2>What happens to your State Pension when you die</h2>
<p>If your spouse or civil partner is over State Pension age when you die, they should <a href="/contact-pension-service" title="Contact the Pension Service">contact the Pension Service</a> to check what they can claim. They may be able to increase their basic State Pension by using your qualifying years if they don’t already get the full amount. </p>

<p>If they are under State Pension age when you die any State Pension based on your qualifying years will be included when they claim their own State Pension. For this to happen they can’t have remarried or formed a new civil partnership by the time they reach State Pension age.</p>

<h3>You’re single or divorced</h3>
<p>If you’re single, divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved and you die after you’ve reached State Pension age, your estate can claim up to 3 months of your basic State Pension. They can only do this if you hadn’t claimed it. </p>

<h3>Extra money from deferring your State Pension</h3>
<p>If you decided to <a href="/deferring-state-pension" title="Deferring your State Pension">defer your State Pension</a> and built up an extra amount, your spouse or civil partner may either claim the extra State Pension or get a lump sum. </p>

<p>If you deferred for less than 12 months your spouse or civil partner can only get extra State Pension, not a lump sum. </p>

<p>If you deferred for 12 months or more they can choose to get extra State Pension or a lump sum payment. Provided they haven’t remarried or formed a new civil partnership since your death they can get this when they reach State Pension age.</p>
