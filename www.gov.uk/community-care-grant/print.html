    <section role="main"><header><h1>Benefits &amp; credits: Community Care Grants</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You could get a Community Care Grant to help you:</p>

<ul>
<li>return to the community after being in care </li>
  <li>stay in your home rather than go into care </li>
  <li>care for a prisoner or young offender when they leave prison on temporary licence</li>
  <li>pay for certain travel expenses, eg going to a family funeral or visiting someone who’s ill</li>
</ul>
<p>How much <a href="/community-care-grant/what-youll-get" title="Money you'll get">money</a> you get depends on your circumstances - there’s no maximum amount. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Any money you get doesn’t have to be paid back and won’t affect your other benefits.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>How much money you get depends on your circumstances - there’s no maximum. However a grant of less than £30 can only be paid for travel costs or living expenses.</p>

<h2>Savings</h2>

<p>You may get less if you have savings: </p>

<ul>
<li>over £500 - where you and your partner are aged under 60</li>
  <li>over £1,000 - where you and or your partner are aged over 60</li>
</ul>
<p>Savings over these limits will reduce what you can get, eg savings of £501 will reduce your grant by £1.</p>

<h2>How you’re paid</h2>

<p>All benefits, pensions and allowances are <a href="/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid" title="How you're paid">paid into an account</a>, eg a bank account. You may be asked to provide receipts if the grant is £500 or more.</p>

</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>You may be able to get a grant if you’re getting one of these benefits (or are likely to get one in the next 6 weeks if you’re due to leave care): </p>

<ul>
<li>Income Support</li>
  <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
  <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Pension Credit</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, one of the following must apply, you: </p>

<ul>
<li>are leaving residential or institutional care - eg a care home or prison </li>
  <li>are being resettled into a new home by your council or a voluntary organisation following an unsettled period in your life</li>
  <li>are looking after someone who is ill, disabled or just out of prison</li>
  <li>need help to stay in your home and not go into residential care or hospital </li>
  <li>need help with expenses to go to a relative’s funeral or visit someone who is ill </li>
  <li>need help because you or your family face exceptional pressure - eg because of a family breakdown or illness </li>
</ul>
