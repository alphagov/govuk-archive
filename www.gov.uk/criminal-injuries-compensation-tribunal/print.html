  </header><p>You can appeal to a tribunal if you disagree with a decision by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (<abbr title="Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority">CICA</abbr>) on your claim for compensation.</p>

<p>You may want to appeal if you are refused compensation or are unhappy with the amount.</p>

<p>The tribunal can:</p>

<ul>
<li>uphold the <abbr title="Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority">CICA</abbr>’s decision</li>
  <li>increase or reduce your award</li>
  <li>decide you shouldn’t get anything</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You have 90 days to appeal to the tribunal from the date of the <abbr title="Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority">CICA</abbr>’s review decision.</p>
</div>

<p>If you miss the deadline, explain why you’re late - eg if you’re waiting for medical reports.</p>

<h2>Help and advice</h2>

</article><article id="after-you-send-your-appeal"><header><h1>Part 3: After you send your appeal</h1>
  </header><p>The tribunal will send a copy of your appeal form to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (<abbr title="Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority">CICA</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority">CICA</abbr> will aim to respond to your appeal within 6 weeks.</p>

<p>You will then have a month to get back to the tribunal with any extra information or arguments.</p>

<h2>How your appeal will be decided</h2>

<p>The tribunal will write to tell you if your appeal will be decided using:</p>

<ul>
<li>the paperwork in the case</li>
  <li>a hearing</li>
</ul>
<p>If your appeal is decided using paperwork, the tribunal judge’s decision will be sent to you by post.</p>

<p>You will be given at least 14 days’ notice of any hearing.</p>

<h2>Hearings</h2>

<p>The hearing will usually be held in the area covered by the police force which investigated the crime.</p>

<p>The hearing will be attended by:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 or 3 tribunal judges or members</li>
  <li>a clerk</li>
  <li>a representative from the <abbr title="Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority">CICA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>any witnesses</li>
</ul>
<p>A police officer who knows about your case may also attend if they can help the tribunal.</p>

<p>Offenders don’t usually attend tribunal hearings.</p>

<h2>What happens at a hearing</h2>

<p>You will be asked questions about the crime and your injuries.</p>

<p>Other witnesses will only come into the hearing room to give evidence, and will then leave.</p>

<p>You or your representative can ask questions during the hearing, and can make points at the end.</p>

<p>You will usually get the tribunal’s decision on the day of the hearing.</p>

<h2>Expenses for going to the hearing</h2>

<p>The tribunal will send you information on how to claim expenses for going to the hearing, such as travel costs.</p>


</article><article id="if-you-lose-your-appeal"><header><h1>Part 4: If you lose your appeal</h1>
  </header><p>The tribunal’s decision is final.</p>

<p>You may be able to ask for a ‘judicial review’ of the decision if you think the decision was wrong for a legal reason.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure about this, you can get <a rel="external" href="http://legaladviserfinder.justice.gov.uk/AdviserSearch.do" title="legal advice">legal advice.</a></p>

<p>Before applying for a judicial review:</p>

<ul>
<li>write to the tribunal, saying why you think the decision was wrong</li>
  <li>ask for written reasons for its decision</li>
</ul>
<p>You must do this within 1 month of the date of the decision.</p>

<h2>Asking for a judicial review</h2>

<h3>England and Wales</h3>
