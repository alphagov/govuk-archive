<h2>Making ‘payments on account’</h2>

<p>It may take you some time to finalise the financial affairs of the person who has died. You can make early Inheritance Tax payments before you know the exact amount the estate owes - these are called ‘payments on account’.</p>

<p>If you do, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) may <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/iht-interest-rates.htm" title="Inheritance Tax interest rates">pay interest on these payments.</a> </p>


</article><article id="pay-through-your-bank-or-by-post"><header><h1>Part 2: Pay through your bank or by post</h1>

<p>You’ll need your <a href="/paying-inheritance-tax/overview" title="Get an Inheritance Tax reference number">Inheritance Tax reference number</a> to pay Inheritance Tax.</p>

<p>It’s your responsibility to make sure payments reach HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) on time. Check your bank’s transaction limits and processing times.</p>

<h2>Online and telephone banking or CHAPS</h2>

<p>Use <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s bank details and your Inheritance Tax reference number as the payment reference.</p>

<h2>Applying for confirmation in Scotland</h2>

</article><article id="paying-in-yearly-instalments"><header><h1>Part 6: Paying in yearly instalments</h1>
  </header><p>You can pay in instalments over 10 years on things that may take time to sell if you’ve said you want to on the IHT400 Inheritance Tax form.</p>

<p>You pay 10% per year. The deadline for the first payment is the end of the sixth month after the death.</p>

<p>There will be <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/inheritancetax/paying-iht/yearly-instalments/interest-instalments.htm" title="interest on instalments">interest to pay</a> on instalments.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must pay the tax in full when the assets are sold.</p>
</div>

<h2>Deadlines</h2>

<p>The first instalment is due at the end of the month 6 months after the death. The second instalment is due 12 months after that, etc.</p>

<h2>What you can pay in instalments on</h2>

<h3>Buildings</h3>

<p>For example, the deceased’s house.</p>

<h3>Gifts</h3>

<p>If the deceased gave you something and there’s still Inheritance Tax to pay on it, you can pay in instalments. If the gift was an unlisted share or security, it must still have been unlisted at the time of the death.</p>

<h3>Shares and securities</h3>

<p>You can pay in instalments if the shares or securities allowed the deceased to control more than 50% of a company’s voting powers.</p>

<p>You can also pay in instalments for ‘unlisted’ shares or securities (ie they’re not traded on a recognised stock exchange) in any of the following cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>they’re worth more than £20,000 and represent at least 10% of the ‘nominal’ value of the company’s share capital (sometimes called the face value), or at least 10% of the nominal value of the company’s ordinary share capital if they are ‘ordinary shares’</li>
  <li>at least 20% of what’s owed is on assets that qualify for payment by instalments</li>
  <li>you’re able to show that the Inheritance Tax on the shares or securities could not be paid in 1 lump sum without causing significant difficulties</li>
</ul>
<h3>Business run for profit</h3>

<p>You can pay in instalments on the net value of a business (but not the business’ assets).</p>

<h3>Agricultural land and property</h3>

<p>This is rare because most agricultural land and property is <a href="/inheritance-tax/gifts-and-exemptions" title="gifts and exemptions">exempt from Inheritance Tax</a>.</p>
