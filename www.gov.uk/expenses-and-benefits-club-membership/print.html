  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer covering the cost of club membership for your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<p>What you have to report and pay depends on who arranges the membership, and who pays the club.</p>


</article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to pay or report anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> if both the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you arrange your employee’s membership and pay the club directly</li>
  <li>the employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or less a year</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the club membership isn’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-club-membership/whats-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you must report it to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and you may have to deduct and pay tax and National Insurance. </p>

<p>This depends on who arranges the membership and who pays the club.</p>

<h2>If you pay fees for an employee</h2>

<p>For employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or more a year, or directors, report the amount you pay on form P11D, section M and pay Class 1A National Insurance.</p>

<h2>If your employee arranges membership but you pay the fees</h2>
