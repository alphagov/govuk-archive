</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer, you might have to pay tax and National Insurance on tips or service charges that employees get from customers. You don’t have to report them to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The tax you have to pay depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>whether the customer chooses to leave money or pays a compulsory service charge</li>
  <li>how the money is then given to staff </li>
</ul>
<p>Money can either be given to staff directly or it can go into a central fund called a ‘tronc’. Someone is appointed to be the ‘troncmaster’ and they divide up the tronc between employees.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> who the troncmaster is so that they can set up a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme for the tronc.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to pay tax and National Insurance if your employees receive tips directly from your customers and they’re allowed to keep them. </p>

</article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If tips aren’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-tips-and-service-charges" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you may have to pay tax and National Insurance on them.</p>

<p>What you need to pay depends on the type of payment (compulsory or voluntary) and how it’s distributed. </p>

<h2>If employees receive money from compulsory service charges</h2>

<p>This counts as earnings, so:</p>

<ul>
<li>add it to your employee’s other earnings</li>
  <li>deduct and pay <abbr title="Pay as you earn">PAYE</abbr> tax and Class 1 National Insurance through payroll</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips and voluntary service charges you distribute to employees</h2>
