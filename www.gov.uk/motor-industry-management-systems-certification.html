<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Motor manufacturers and their supply chains can benefit by introducing quality management systems into their business processes. There are a number of internationally recognised certification schemes, some of which are designed specifically for the industry.</p>

<p>Gaining recognition through the certificate scheme is a way of showing customers that your business is committed to quality in its processes and products. In addition to this, formal certification to a recognised standard is often a condition of supply. There are also schemes to help you implement procedures to reduce your business’ environmental impact and manage issues such as health and safety.</p>

<p>This guide gives an overview of quality management systems you may want to consider. You will also find out where to go if you want to apply for certification and how to find accredited certification bodies in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="quality-schemes-relevant-to-the-automotive-industry">Quality schemes relevant to the automotive industry</h2>

<p>The most relevant quality certification system for the motor industry is the <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>/TS 16949 standard. This was developed by the International Automotive Task Force (<abbr title="International Automotive Task Force">IATF</abbr>) in cooperation with the International Standards Organisation (<abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>/TS 16949 integrates US and European automotive standards into a single standard for the entire automotive industry. It sets out requirements for the design, servicing, installation and production of automotive-related products.</p>

<p>There are also several additional standards that are relevant to the automotive industry. These systems are designed by international authorities such as the <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>, and so are internationally recognised. They include:</p>

<ul>
<li>generic schemes such as <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 9001, which relate to quality management processes within your business - administration, customer relations etc</li>
  <li>environmental accreditation systems such as <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 14001 and the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (<abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme">EMAS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>health and safety standards such as OHSAS 18001</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-quality-management-in-the-automotive-industry">The benefits of quality management in the automotive industry</h2>

<p>Quality management certification is a way of proving to your customers that they can trust your business’ capabilities as a supplier, and the quality and consistency of the products you will deliver.</p>

<p>Following environmental and health and safety certification schemes can also help your business. Environmental schemes help you to minimise costs by reducing your consumption of energy and materials, therefore reducing the cost of disposing of or recycling your waste. Health and safety schemes provide a framework for your business to manage these issues effectively.</p>

<p>Increased confidence among your buyers can bring obvious competitive advantages. Increasingly, customers or suppliers will only enter into contracts with businesses that have a certified quality management scheme.</p>

<p>By becoming certified and building customer confidence, your business could benefit from:</p>

<ul>
<li>improved operational efficiency and productivity</li>
  <li>an increased market share</li>
  <li>less waste and fewer defects, and the associated savings</li>
  <li>consistently improved productivity, strengthened by a common approach to standards throughout the automotive industry structures that will deliver continued improvements in business processes and customer satisfaction</li>
  <li>increased stability, boosting employee motivation and involvement</li>
  <li>a structure in place for training and improvement</li>
  <li>a framework to assess the effectiveness of the system and controls in place</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-route-to-isots-16949-certification-for-automotive-businesses">The route to <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>/TS 16949 certification for automotive businesses</h2>

<p><abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>/TS 16949 is a quality standard specific to the automotive industry. It aims to harmonise the various quality systems that already exist in the automotive supply chain.</p>

<p>The standard specifies requirements for the design, development, production, installation and servicing of automotive-related products.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="International Automotive Task Force">IATF</abbr> developed the standard in cooperation with the <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>. It is based on the structure of <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 9001:2000, and replaced the QS-9000 automotive quality standard in 2006.</p>

<p>Businesses working towards the <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>/TS 16949 standard must carry out process-based internal auditing. The standard is commonly known as ‘TS2’, and includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a commitment to quality</li>
  <li>a focus on meeting customer requirements</li>
  <li>a commitment to being adequately resourced and competently staffed</li>
  <li>quality in process management (production, service, administrative) and in monitoring those processes</li>
  <li>a commitment to prevent and resolve customer complaints, to drive continual improvement</li>
  <li>gauging customer perception of quality of your business’ goods/services</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030208530">buy the full text of the <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>/TS 16949:2009 standard online on the British Standards Institute (<abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pre-assessment-and-training">Pre-assessment and training</h3>

<p>If you are considering <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>/TS 16949 certification, you may want to employ a consultant to audit your current management practices. The consultant will explain the improvements that may have to be made before your business would comply with certification requirements.</p>

<p>Various businesses offer training courses and seminars that are tailored to <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>/TS 16949. These courses can give your implementation team the skills they need to bring your business practices in line with the standard.</p>

<h2 id="other-management-system-standards-for-the-automotive-industry">Other management system standards for the automotive industry</h2>

<p>As well as the <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>/TS 16949 quality management standard, there are a number of additional <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> standards that your business should be aware of.</p>

<h3 id="iso-9001">
<abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 9001</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 9000 series of quality standards are recognised worldwide. They are designed to apply to all businesses, whether you are a manufacturer or service provider.</p>

<p><abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 9001 includes the ‘Plan, Do, Check, Act’ cycle, which is the operating principle of all the <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>’s management system standards:</p>

<ul>
<li>plan - analyse your business’ situation, establish your overall objectives and set your interim targets and develop plans to achieve them</li>
  <li>do - implement your plans</li>
  <li>check - measure/monitor how far your actual achievements meet your planned objectives</li>
  <li>act - correct and learn from your mistakes to improve your plans so you can achieve better results next time - find out more from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm">International Organization for Standardization</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iso-14001">
<abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 14001</h3>

<p><abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 14001 is an internationally recognised environmental management system standard. It is designed to help your business comply fully with environmental regulations, and make continuous improvements in its environmental performance.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 14001 standard requires your business to:</p>

<ul>
<li>create an environmental policy</li>
  <li>communicate your environmental policy and approach to staff and stakeholders</li>
  <li>appreciate environmental issues and your environmental impact</li>
  <li>implement formal control systems and monitoring procedures</li>
  <li>set objectives and targets</li>
  <li>comply with all relevant legislation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-eco-management-and-audit-scheme">The Eco-Management and Audit Scheme</h3>

<p><abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme">EMAS</abbr> is a voluntary scheme based on <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 14001, which is also aimed at helping you manage your environment impact. The key difference from the <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 14001 standard is that <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme">EMAS</abbr> requires the public reporting of your performance. Businesses are increasingly able to use these environmental reports in their investor and public relations materials and annual reports.</p>

<h3 id="ohsas-18001">OHSAS 18001</h3>

<p>Following the same approach as the environmental standard <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 14001, OHSAS 18001 aims to give a framework for providing a safe and healthy working environment. The standard also provides guidelines on how to integrate health and safety policies into your overall management system. The key requirements of the standard include:</p>

<ul>
<li>creation of a health and safety policy</li>
  <li>appreciation of your health and safety issues and their potential impact</li>
  <li>formalising your control systems and monitoring processes</li>
  <li>communication of your health and safety policy and approach to staff and stakeholders</li>
  <li>setting objectives and targets</li>
  <li>complying with relevant legislation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-apply-for-management-systems-certification">How to apply for management systems certification</h2>

<p>Once you have decided to apply for management systems certification, you must choose a certification/inspection body. This should ideally have been accredited or recognised by the appropriate organisation. For <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 9001, <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> 14001, Acorn and OHSAS 18001, this will be the UK Accreditation Service (<abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>).</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukas.com/About-Accreditation/Accredited-Bodies/certification-body-schedules.asp">view a list of accredited certification bodies on the <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>/TS 16949 the accrediting body is the International Automotive Task Force (<abbr title="International Automotive Task Force">IATF</abbr>), through the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Limited.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.iatfglobaloversight.org/certBodies.aspx">view a list of recognised <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr>/TS16949 certification bodies on the <abbr title="International Automotive Task Force">IATF</abbr> website</a>.</p>
