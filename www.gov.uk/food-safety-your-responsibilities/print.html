<h3>Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (<abbr title="Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Principles">HACCP</abbr>) plan</h3>

<p>If you run a food business, you usually have to write a plan based on the <a href="/food-safety-hazard-analysis" title="HACCP principles"><abbr title="Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Principles">HACCP</abbr> principles</a>. This keeps your food safe from biological, chemical and physical safety hazards. </p>

<h3>Food contact materials</h3>

<ul>
<li>packaging</li>
  <li>food processing equipment</li>
  <li>cookware </li>
  <li>work surfaces</li>
</ul>
<h3>To keep food safe for consumption:</h3>

<ul>
<li>make sure food contact materials don’t transfer anything to food they touch</li>
  <li>make sure food contact materials don’t change the food they touch</li>
  <li>when inspected, be able to show where the food contact materials came from</li>

</article><article id="food-inspections"><header><h1>Part 3: Food inspections</h1>
  </header><p>You can be inspected by your local council at any point in the food production and distribution process.  All inspectors must follow the <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/enforcement/enforcework/foodlawcop/" title="Download the Food Law Code of Practice">Food Law Code of Practice.</a> Usually, you won’t be told an inspection is going to happen.</p>

<p>How often you’re inspected depends on the risk your business poses to public health.  You might not be inspected as often if you’re a member of a recognised assurance scheme.  You can search for a registered assurance scheme online.</p>

<p>If you’re a <a rel="external" href="http://food.gov.uk/foodindustry/regulation/hygleg/hyglegresources/sfbb/sfbbretail/" title="Food Standards Agency">food retailer</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://food.gov.uk/foodindustry/regulation/hygleg/hyglegresources/sfbb/sfbbcaterers/" title="Food Standards Agency">caterer</a> you will be inspected on a more regular basis to make sure you comply with food safety laws.</p>

<h2>After the inspection</h2>

<p>You’ll be sent a letter confirming any improvements you need to make and by when. Usually, you’re responsible for confirming these
improvements have been made.</p>

<p>For serious food safety problems you may be sent a ‘notice’. The notice can include banning you from using certain equipment or processes until improvements have been made. Your business will be revisited to make sure you have followed the improvements in the notice. Example notices include a:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hygiene Improvement Notice</li>
  <li>Hygiene Emergency Prohibition Notices - banning you from using certain equipment or following certain processes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Appeals</h2>

<p>Your letter or notice should tell you how you can appeal a decision by an inspector.</p>
