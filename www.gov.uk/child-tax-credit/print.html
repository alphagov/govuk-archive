<ul>
<li>under 16 </li>

<p>You don’t need to be working to claim Child Tax Credit.</p>

<p>You get <a href="child-tax-credit/what-youll-get" title="Money you can get">money</a> for each child that qualifies and Child Tax Credit won’t affect your Child Benefit. </p>

<p>How much you get depends on your circumstances - you can use the <a href="/tax-credits-calculator" title="Tax credits calculator">tax credit calculator</a> to work this out. </p>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>You get a basic amount and extra (known as ‘elements”) on top of this. </p>

<p>How much you get depends on things like your income and circumstances (eg if your child is disabled). </p>

<p>The basic amount is up to £545 a year.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/tax-credits-calculator" title="tax credit calculator">tax credit calculator</a> to work out how much you can get.</p>
</div>

<h2>How you’re paid</h2>

<p>All benefits, pensions and allowances are paid <a href="/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid" title="How to have your benefits paid">into an account</a> (eg a bank account) of the person mainly responsible for the child.</p>

<p>You’re paid from the date of your claim up to the end of the tax year (5 April). </p>

<h2>If your circumstances change</h2>

<p>Your tax credits you get can go up or down if your family or work life change - you must <a href="/changes-that-affect-your-tax-credits" title="Changes that affect your tax credits">report these changes</a> to the Tax Credit Office. For example, your income changes by more than £2,500 or your child leaves home.</p>

</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>Eligibility depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the child’s age </li>
  <li>your income </li>
  <li>if you’re responsible for the child </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/qualify-tax-credits-quick-questionnaire" title="Tax credit questionnaire">tax credit questionnaire</a> to check if you qualify.</p>
</div>

<h2>The child’s age</h2>

<p>To qualify the child must be:</p>

<ul>
<li>under 16 - you can claim up until the 31st August after their 16th birthday</li>
  <li>under 20 - if they’re in approved education or training</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your income</h2>

<p>There’s no set limit for income because it depends on your circumstances (and those of your partner). For example, it’s sometimes £26,000 for a 1 child family but can be higher if you pay for <a href="/childcare-tax-credits" title="Childcare and tax credits">approved childcare</a> or one of you is disabled. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/tax-credits-calculator" title="Tax credit calculator">tax credit calculator</a> to check if your income is too high for tax credits.</p>
</div>

<h2>Responsibility for a child</h2>

<p>You’re usually responsible for a child if they: </p>

<ul>
<li>live with you all the time</li>
  <li>they normally live with you and you’re the main carer</li>
  <li>they live in Europe but are financially dependent on you</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact the Tax Credit Helpline if you’re not sure you’re responsible for the child. </p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Tax Credit Helpline</strong><br><strong>Telephone:</strong> 0345 300 3900<br><strong>Textphone:</strong> 0345 300 3909</p>
</div>

<h2>If the child is disabled</h2>

<p>You may get extra Child Tax Credits if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the child gets Disability Living Allowance</li>
  <li>the child is registered blind (or was within 28 weeks of your tax credits claim)</li>
</ul>
<p>You still qualify if Disability Living Allowance stops because the child goes into hospital.</p>

</article><article id="how-to-claim"><header><h1>Part 4: How to claim</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re new to tax credits, contact the Tax Credit Helpline for a claim form. It takes up to 2 weeks to arrive. </p>

<p>If you’re already claiming tax credits you don’t need a claim form - just call the helpline to update your claim.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Tax Credit Helpline</strong><br><strong>Telephone:</strong> 0345 300 3900<br><strong>Textphone:</strong> 0345 300 3909</p>
</div>

<h2>What you need to know</h2>

<p>Only one household can get Child Tax Credit for a child. </p>

<p>You can claim at any time of the year and apply for Child and Working Tax Credits on the same claim form. </p>

<p>You have to <a href="/renewing-your-tax-credits-claim" title="Renew your tax credits">renew your claim</a> once a year. </p>

<p>To support your claim, keep records about your income, bills, payslips, benefits, tax credits, child care and your child’s education. </p>
