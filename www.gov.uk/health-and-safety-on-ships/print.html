</div>

<h2>Writing a health and safety policy</h2>

<p>You must have a policy that sets out how you will manage health and safety on your ship. You can find advice on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/write.htm" title="health and safety policies">writing a health and safety policy</a> on the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website.</p>


</article><article id="risk-assessments"><header><h1>Part 2: Risk assessments</h1>
  </header><p>You must carry out regular risk assessments to see how accidents, injuries or illnesses could be caused on your ship and what you can do to reduce the chances of them happening.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must review risk assessments every year and whenever there are significant changes to the ship, or any working activities.</p>
</div>

<p>Chapter 1 of the ‘Code of safe working practices for merchant seamen: consolidated edition 2010’ explains basic requirements for risk assessments on board ships. </p>

</article><article id="safe-working-practices"><header><h1>Part 3: Safe working practices</h1>
  </header><h2>Code of safe working practices</h2>

<p>By law, you must carry up-to-date copies of the ‘Code of safe working practices for merchant seamen’ if you manage or operate a UK ship that’s not a fishing boat or pleasure craft.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must make a copy of the code available to any seaman who requests it.</p>
</div>

<p>The ‘Code of safe working practices for merchant seamen (Consolidated edition 2011)’ is available to buy from <a rel="external" href="http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?FO=1159966&amp;Action=Book&amp;ProductID=9780115532078&amp;From=SearchResults" title="Code of safe working practices for merchant seamen 2011">The Stationery Office.</a></p>

<h2>‘Permit to work’</h2>

<p>You can reduce the risk of accidents on board ship by using safe working systems like the ‘permit to work’. Under this system, seafarers must get written permission from a senior officer before they can perform hazardous tasks, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>working aloft and outboard</li>
  <li>working with boilers</li>
  <li>‘hot work’ (work which could result in the ignition of flammable material, eg welding) </li>
  <li>working in unmanned machinery spaces </li>
  <li>entry into enclosed spaces </li>
  <li>electrical testing</li>
