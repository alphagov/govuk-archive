  </header><p>You can get Child Benefit until your child turns 20 if they’re in eligible education. They must be accepted onto the course before they turn 19. </p>

<h2>Courses that count</h2>

<p>Education must be full-time (more than an average of 12 hours’ supervised study a week) and ‘non-advanced’. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>GCSEs</li>
  <li>A levels</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="National Vocational Qualification">NVQ</abbr>/<abbr title="Scottish Vocational Qualification">SVQ</abbr> level 1, 2 or 3</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Business and Technology Education Council">BTEC</abbr> National Diploma, National Certificate and First Diploma</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Scottish Certificate of Education">SCE</abbr> higher grade or similar</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t include ‘advanced’ education, eg:</p>

<abbr title="National Vocational Qualification">NVQ</abbr> level 4 or above</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Business and Technology Education Council">BTEC</abbr> Higher National Certificate (<abbr title="Higher National Certificate">HNC</abbr>) or Higher National Diploma (<abbr title="Higher National Diploma">HND</abbr>)</li>
  <li>teacher training</li>
</ul>
<h2>Study abroad</h2>

<p>If your child’s studying abroad, you can usually only get Child Benefit for the first 12 weeks they’re away. You’ll keep getting it after this if they’re only abroad because they’re either:</p>

<ul>
<li>on an educational exchange or visit (with written agreement from their school or college)</li>
  <li>in education that counts for Child Benefit in a country in the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) or Switzerland</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> countries</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>all <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm" title="countries in the EU">countries in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>

</div>

</article><article id="breaks-in-education-or-training"><header><h1>Part 4: Breaks in education or training</h1>
  </header><p>You may get Child Benefit for 6 months if the break is for a good reason, eg your child is ill, changing course or pregnant.</p>

<p>You may be able to get Child Benefit for longer than 6 months if your child is:</p>

<ul>
<li>in <a href="/child-benefit-hospital-residential-care" title="Child Benefit if your child is in hospital or residential care">hospital or residential care</a>
</li>
  <li>getting medical treatment abroad</li>
</ul>
<h2>Voluntary breaks</h2>

<p>You can’t normally get Child Benefit if your child has taken a voluntary break in education or training, eg if they travel overseas for personal reasons.</p>

<h2>After the break</h2>

<p>If your child goes back to education or training after a break, you should <a href="/child-benefit/how-to-claim" title="claim Child Benefit">make a new claim</a>.</p>

<div class="advisory">
<p><strong>If your child doesn’t go back into eligible education or training, you may have to pay back some of the payments you got during the break.</strong></p>
</div>


</article><article id="your-child-leaves-education-or-training"><header><h1>Part 5: Your child leaves education or training</h1>
  </header><p>If your child leaves education or training at or after 16, Child Benefit will stop. </p>

<p>When this happens depends on things like when your child’s birthday is, or the reasons why they left the education or training.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>When your child leaves</th>
      <th>When payments stop</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The year they turn 16</td>
      <td>31 August after their 16th birthday (if your child turns 16 on 31 August, payments stop then)</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>After age 16</td>
      <td>Last day of February, 31 May, 31 August or 30 November - whichever comes first</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

<p>Your child is 16 and gets their exam results in July. The results mean they can’t do the course they wanted. </p>

<p>Child Benefit payments will stop on 31 August.</p>
</div>

<p>You can apply for a <a href="child-benefit-extensions" title="Child Benefit extensions">20-week extension of Child Benefit</a> if your child is under 18 and leaves education or training if they register with local careers services or the armed forces.</p>

<p>Child Benefit stops straightaway if your child:</p>

<ul>
<li>starts paid work for 24 hours a week or more</li>
  <li>gets certain benefits (ie Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, tax credits, Incapacity Benefit or income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">

</div>

<h2>Your child returns to school or college for exams</h2>

<p>If your child was entered for exams before they left school or college, you can normally still get Child Benefit.</p>

<p>The exams must be for the course they were doing before they left - and the course must have been an eligible <a href="education" title="education that counts for Child Benefit">education</a> or <a href="training" title="training that counts for Child Benefit">training</a> course.</p>

<p>Child Benefit will normally carry on from the date of the last exam until the week that includes the earliest of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the last day of February</li>
  <li>31 May</li>
  <li>31 August</li>
  <li>30 November</li>
</ul>
<h2>If your child leaves education but then goes back</h2>

<p>If your child returns to education or training and it counts for Child Benefit, you can make another claim.</p>

<p>Your child needs to have started, enrolled or been accepted on a course before their 19th birthday.</p>

</article><article id="child-benefit-extensions"><header><h1>Part 6: Extensions: careers services and the armed forces</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for a 20-week <a rel="external" href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CBOCH299e?dept-name=CBO&amp;sub-dept-name=&amp;location=3&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk" title="apply for a Child Benefit extension">Child Benefit</a> extension if your 16 or 17-year-old leaves education or training but registers with your local careers services or the armed forces.</p>

  <li>gets certain benefits (eg Income Support) or tax credits</li>
