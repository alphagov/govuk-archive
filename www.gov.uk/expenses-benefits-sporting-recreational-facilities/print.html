  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer paying for sporting or recreational facilities for your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>This includes: </p>

<ul>
<li>sporting or recreational facilities that you provide directly, eg a gym</li>
  <li>vouchers that can be exchanged for the use of sporting or recreational facilities</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You won’t have to report anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or pay tax and National Insurance if the facilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>are available for use by all of your employees</li>
  <li>aren’t available to the general public</li>
  <li>are used mainly by employees, former employees or members of employees’ families and households (employees of any companies you’ve grouped together with to provide the facilities also count)</li>
  <li>are somewhere that isn’t a private home, holiday or other overnight accommodation (including any associated sporting facilities)</li>
  <li>don’t involve the use of a mechanically propelled vehicle (including road vehicles, boats and aircraft).</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You won’t have to report or pay anything if your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 per year, even if they don’t meet the conditions for exemption.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the facilities you provide aren’t <a href="/expenses-benefits-sporting-recreational-facilities/whats-exempt" title="facilities you provide aren’t exempt">exempt</a>, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>report on form P11D, section K</li>
  <li>pay Class 1A National Insurance on the value of the benefit</li>
</ul></article><article id="work-out-the-value"><header><h1>Part 4: Work out the value</h1>
  </header><p>The value to use is normally the cost to you of providing the facilities.</p>

<p>However, if there isn’t a simple way of working this out (eg if you provide shared access for several employees to a gym that’s also open to the general public), you should check with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s employer helpline.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> employer helpline</strong><br><strong>Telephone:</strong> 08457 143 143  <br><strong>Textphone:</strong> 0845 602 1380<br>
Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm <br>
Saturday, 8am to 4pm  <br>
Closed Sundays, Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day</p>
