</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you disagree with a decision about benefits, tax credits or a child support payment, you can appeal to the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal.</p>

<p>The tribunal is independent and can change the decision if they think it’s wrong.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>It can take the tribunal a few months to deal with your case.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who to appeal to</h2>

<p>You need to appeal to the organisation that made the decision:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Decision you’re appealing against</th>
      <th>Who to appeal to</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Benefits like Jobseeker’s Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance</td>
      <td>Department for Work and Pensions</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Child support payments</td>
      <td>Child Maintenance Group</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Tax credits</td>
      <td>HM Revenue and Customs</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Housing Benefit</td>
      <td>your local council</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Council Tax Benefit</td>
      <td>your local council</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Before you appeal, ask the department or council if they can look at the decision again, and reconsider it.</p>

<h2>How to appeal</h2>

<p>You can appeal by letter or filling in a form - details will be on the letter giving you the decision.</p>

<p>Include any evidence or information supporting your appeal - eg a letter from your doctor.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You usually have one month to appeal against a decision - if you miss the deadline, explain why you’re late.</p>
</div>

<h2>What the department or council will do with your appeal</h2>

<p>After you send your appeal, the council or department may change their decision - eg let you have the benefit or tax credit.</p>

<p>If they disagree with your appeal, they will forward the documents in the case to you and the tribunal.</p>

<p>The tribunal will let you know if it can look into your case. If it can’t, it will explain why.</p>

</article><article id="after-you-send-your-appeal"><header><h1>Part 2: After you send your appeal</h1>
  </header><p>The tribunal will send you an ‘enquiry form’, like the one below, asking how you want your case to be dealt with.</p>

<div class="form-download">

</div>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/guidance/courts-and-tribunals/tribunals/social-security-and-child-support/forms-and-how-to-appeal/enquiry-form/InformationLeaflet.pdf" title="Download 'enquiry form guidance notes' (PDF, 26KB)" rel="external">Download ‘enquiry form guidance notes’ (PDF, 26KB)</a></p>
</div>

<h2>How your case will be dealt with</h2>

<p>On the form, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>say if you want to go to a hearing about the case, to put your case in person</li>
  <li>ask the tribunal to reach its decision by looking at the paperwork</li>
</ul>
<p>If there isn’t a hearing, the tribunal will send you a copy of its decision in the post.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You have to return the enquiry form to the tribunal within 14 days.</p>
</div>

<h2>Evidence supporting your appeal</h2>

<p>You can use documents to support your appeal, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>a letter from your doctor</li>
  <li>accounts showing your earnings if you’re self-employed</li>
  <li>letters to your former partner about child care arrangements</li>
</ul>
<p>Send copies of these documents to the tribunal as soon as you can. </p>

<p>This will give the department or council a chance to look at the evidence, and they could change their decision as a result.</p>

<h2>Where a hearing can take place</h2>

<p>The tribunal will give you at least 14 days’ notice of the date of any hearing - this will usually be within the following 6 weeks.</p>

<p>The tribunal will try to hold the hearing near your home. You can ask for it to be held at another <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/sscs/venues" title="tribunal venue">tribunal venue.</a></p>

</article><article id="going-to-a-tribunal-hearing"><header><h1>Part 3: Going to a tribunal hearing</h1>
  </header><p>When you go to the tribunal hearing, take your appeal papers and the documents you’re using as evidence with you.</p>

<h2>Who will be at the hearing</h2>

<p>The tribunal can be made up of a judge and experts - eg a GP or an accountant (depending on what the case is about).</p>

<p>The department or council may send a representative, known as a ‘presenting officer’, to your hearing.</p>

<p>You can bring someone to the hearing to help you - eg a friend, neighbour, relative or someone from an advice centre.</p>

<h2>What happens at the hearing</h2>

<p>The judge and tribunal members will ask you questions about your case.</p>

<p>They will then question anyone you’ve brought to the hearing to support your case.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You normally get the tribunal’s decision on the day, but it may be sent in the post a few days after the hearing.</p>
</div>

<h2>Claiming expenses</h2>

<p>You may be able to claim for expenses for going to the tribunal:</p>

<ul>
<li>travelling expenses - the fare on public transport</li>
  <li>meals - £4.75 if you’re away for more than 5 hours, or £9.30 for more than 10 hours</li>
  <li>loss of earnings - £30.50 if you’re away from work for more than 4 hours, or £60.50 for more than 10 hours</li>
  <li>care expenses (eg for a child-minder) - £5.73 an hour for each child or adult</li>
</ul>
<p>The clerk will help you fill in a claim form when you go to the hearing.</p>

<p>Make sure you take receipts, and a letter from your employer for loss of earnings.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Contact the tribunal as soon as possible if you need to get a taxi, or have to stay away from home overnight.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="if-you-lose-your-appeal"><header><h1>Part 4: If you lose your appeal</h1>
  </header><p>If you lose your appeal, you can ask for permission to appeal to a higher tribunal, called the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber).</p>

<p>The upper tribunal can look at the case to see if the original decision was correct.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must ask for permission to appeal within one month of getting the decision.</p>
</div>

<h2>Reasons for appealing</h2>

<p>You can only appeal if you think the decision was wrong for a legal reason, eg if the tribunal didn’t:</p>

<ul>
<li>follow the right procedures - eg didn’t tell you in time about the hearing</li>
  <li>give proper reasons for its decision, or back up the decision with facts</li>
  <li>apply the law properly</li>
</ul>
<p>Before appealing, ask the original tribunal for the ‘statement of reasons’ for its decision.</p>

<p>If you still think the decision was wrong, fill in the form below:</p>

</div>

<p>Send the form to the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal.</p>

<p>If the tribunal doesn’t give you permission to appeal, you can use the same form to apply directly to the upper tribunal.</p>

<h2>What the upper tribunal can do</h2>

<p>The upper tribunal can:</p>

<ul>
<li>cancel the decision and refer the case to a new hearing</li>
  <li>come to its own decision on the case, replacing the original decision</li>
  <li>reject the appeal</li>
</ul>
