    <section role="main"><header><h1>Compensation after an accident or injury, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="write-a-letter-complain-or-try-mediation"><header><h1>Part 1: Write a letter, complain or try mediation</h1>
  </header><p>You can get compensation by taking legal action, but it could cost you money and you may not win your case against the person or organisation to blame.</p>

<h2>Writing a letter or making a complaint</h2>

<p>If it’s not a serious injury, you may be able to solve the issue by writing a letter or making a complaint - use the complaints procedure if there is one.</p>

<p>Explain what went wrong and tell them how much compensation you want or how they can make up for the injury.</p>

<h2>Using mediation</h2>

<p>You may want to use a <a rel="external" href="http://www.civilmediation.justice.gov.uk/" title="mediation service">mediation service</a> to negotiate a settlement.</p>

<p>There is usually a fee, but it can be cheaper, quicker and easier than going to court.</p>

</article><article id="check-your-insurance-policies"><header><h1>Part 2: Check your insurance policies</h1>
  </header><p>You may already have insurance to pay for legal costs.</p>

<ul>
<li>check your insurance policies (like motor, home contents or holiday insurance policies) to see if they include ‘legal expenses insurance’</li>
  <li>check if you have legal cover as a member of a trade union, or an organisation like the RAC or the AA</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Policies normally only cover you for some types of legal problem and have other terms and conditions.</p>
</div>

<h2>‘After the event’ insurance</h2>

<p>If you’re not insured, you could take out insurance after the incident to protect yourself against a large legal bill.</p>

<p>A solicitor can help you choose an ‘after-the-event’ insurance policy and may take it out on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you win, you may be able to get some of the costs back from the losing side.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Some insurance companies will not insure you if they think you’re unlikely to succeed, and some policies are very expensive.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="using-a-solicitor-or-a-claims-company"><header><h1>Part 3: Using a solicitor or a claims company</h1>
  </header><p>You can’t usually get legal aid for personal injury cases.</p>

<p>A solicitor should advise you on costs before you agree to hire them.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Get advice from <a href="http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/index/contact_us.htm" title="Contact Citizens Advice" rel="external">Citizens Advice</a> on what’s involved in taking legal action and how much it will cost you.</p>
</div>

<h2>Claims companies</h2>

<p>Businesses known as claims companies can help you find a solicitor.</p>

<p>Most claims handlers aren’t solicitors, and so won’t be able to represent you in court.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Check that a claims company is authorised: <a href="http://www.claimsregulation.gov.uk/search.aspx/" title="business search" rel="external">business search.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>‘No win, no fee’ deals</h2>

<p>If you use a ‘no win, no fee’ agreement, you will only have to pay the solicitor’s fee if you win the case.</p>

<p>You may still have to pay for some other costs, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>fees to pay for experts </li>
  <li>court fees </li>
  <li>travelling expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>If you lose, you will also have to pay for:</p>

<ul>
<li>the other side’s legal costs </li>
  <li>other expenses and charges, such as fees for witnesses</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The solicitor may charge a fee for winning the case.</p>
