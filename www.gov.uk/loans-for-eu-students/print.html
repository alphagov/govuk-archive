  </header><h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>Eligibility depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>your nationality or residency status</li>
  <li>your course</li>
  <li>your university or college</li>
</ul>
<h2>EU students</h2>
<p>To get a <strong>Tuition Fee Loan</strong> you must be an EU national, or the family member of an EU national</p>

For more detail <a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@educ/documents/digitalasset/dg_200470.pdf" title="Download the guide 'How you are assessed and paid' (PDF, 300KB)">download the guide ‘How you are assessed and paid’ (PDF, 300KB).</a></p>

<h2>Your course</h2>
<p>This should be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a first degree, eg, a Bachelor of Arts, Science or Education (BA, BSc or BEd)</li>
  <li>a Foundation Degree</li>

  <li>a Higher National Diploma (HND)</li>
  <li>Initial Teacher Training</li>
  <li>further training of youth and community workers</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally you’ll only get student finance if you’re doing your first higher education qualification. However, you may still get it if, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’ve changed course</li>
  <li>you’ve withdrawn from your course but decide to start again</li>
  <li>you’re ‘topping up’ a higher education qualification – for example, you’ve finished a foundation degree and now want to do an honours degree</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part-time courses</h3>
<p>Part-time courses need to be least 25% of an equivalent full-time course (for example 4 years part-time instead of 1 year full-time). This is known as ‘course intensity’. You can check course intensity with your university or college.</p>

<h2>Your university or college</h2>
<p>This should be at a university, college or other institution that offers a qualifying course. </p>
