  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You must wear a seat belt if one is fitted in the seat you’re using - there are only a few exceptions.</p>

<p>You’re also only allowed one person in each seat fitted with a seat belt.</p>

<p>Children must use the <a href="/child-car-seats-the-rules" title="correct car seat">correct car seat</a> for their weight until they reach 135 centimetres tall or their 12th birthday, whichever is first.</p>

<p>If you don’t wear a seat belt and you’re caught you could face a fixed penalty of £60 or a fine of up to £500 if the case goes to court.</p>

</article><article id="when-you-dont-need-to-wear-a-seat-belt"><header><h1>Part 2: When you don't need to wear a seat belt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t need to wear a seat belt if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>a driver who is reversing, or supervising a learner driver who is reversing</li>
  <li>in a vehicle being used for police, fire and rescue services</li>
  <li>a passenger in a trade vehicle and you’re investigating a fault</li>
  <li>driving a goods vehicle on deliveries that is travelling no more than 50 metres between stops</li>
  <li>a licensed taxi driver who is ‘plying for hire’ or carrying passengers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Medical exemptions</h2>

<p>Your doctor may say you don’t have to wear a seat belt for a medical reason. They’ll give you a ‘Certificate of Exemption from Compulsory Seat Belt Wearing’. You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep this in your vehicle</li>
  <li>show it to the police if you’re stopped</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need to tell your car insurer.</p>

<p>Talk to your doctor for more information and download the leaflet to find out more.</p>

<h3>Wearing a seat belt if you’re disabled</h3>

<p>You must wear a seat belt if you’re a disabled driver or passenger, unless you don’t have to for medical reasons. You may need to adapt your vehicle.</p>

</article><article id="if-your-vehicle-doesnt-have-seat-belts"><header><h1>Part 3: If your vehicle doesn’t have seat belts</h1>
  </header><p>If your vehicle doesn’t have seat belts, for example it’s a classic car, you aren’t allowed to carry any children under 3 years old in it.</p>

<p>Children over 3 are only allowed to sit in the back seats.</p>

<p>These rules only apply if your vehicle was originally made without seat belts.</p>
