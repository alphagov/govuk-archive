  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><h2>Work in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country</h2>
<p>As a UK citizen, you have the right to work in any country in the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) without a work permit.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>all <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm" title="Countries in the EU: Europa">countries in the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your rights</h3>
<p>You’ll have the same rights as nationals of the country you’re working in when it comes to:</p>

<ul>
<li>working conditions</li>
  <li>pay</li>
  <li>social security (eg benefits)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work in a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country</h2>
<p>As a UK citizen, you will need a work permit to work in most non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries. In most cases, you’ll need a job offer from your chosen country so that you can get a visa to move there. Some countries, like Australia, Canada and New Zealand, use a points system to decide whether you’re eligible for a visa. </p>

<p>Check with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/what-we-do/protocol/embassies-in-uk/" title="Embassies in the UK">UK-based embassy</a> of the country you want to work in to see what you need to do.</p>


</article><article id="healthcare-and-insurance"><header><h1>Part 2: Healthcare and insurance</h1>
  </header><p>The UK has ‘reciprocal’ healthcare arrangements with most European countries. This means that UK citizens get free or reduced cost medical treatment. If you’re going to be working in a European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) country, you need to get an <a href="/apply-renew-european-health-insurance-card" title="Apply for or renew an EHIC"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> (European Health Insurance Card)</a> to get this treatment.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>all <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm" title="Countries in the EU: Europa">countries in the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>, you usually have to pay for any medical treatment, although there are a few exceptions to this. A <a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/countryguide/NonEEAcountries/Pages/Non-EEAcountries.aspx" title="Country by country guide to healthcare in non-EEA countries">country-by-country guide</a> to what you can get is on the NHS Choices website. </p>


</article><article id="posted-workers"><header><h1>Part 3: Posted workers</h1>
  </header><p>If your employer temporarily sends you from one <a href="/working-abroad/overview" title="Work in another EU country - overview">European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>)</a> country to another, you’re a ‘posted worker’.</p>

<h3>Protection for posted workers</h3>

<p>Your employer must follow some of the employment rules of the country you’ve been posted to. These are the ones relating to:</p>

<ul>
<li>maximum work periods and minimum rest periods</li>
  <li>minimum paid annual holidays</li>
  <li>the minimum rates of pay (including overtime)</li>
  <li>health and safety at work</li>
  <li>protection for women who are pregnant or have just given birth</li>
  <li>equal treatment for men and women and other rules to prevent discrimination</li>
  <li>hiring out agency workers</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
If the country you’re posted to has a higher minimum wage, your employer must give you that rate or higher.</p>
</div>

<p>Your employer is allowed to offer you better employment terms and conditions than the minimum in the country you’ve been posted to.</p>


</article><article id="national-insurance"><header><h1>Part 4: National Insurance</h1>
  </header><p>If you go to work in an <a href="/working-abroad/overview" title="Work in another EU country - overview">European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>)</a> country, you may have to pay National Insurance Contributions for the time you’re abroad. </p>

<p>Normally, this means you won’t have to pay contributions to the other country’s social security scheme. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/international/ni-abroad.htm" title="National Insurance contributions when you work outside the UK">More information</a> is on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website. </p>

<p>Wherever you’re going, you can also choose to <a href="/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions/why-pay-voluntary-contributions" title="Find out more about voluntary contributions">pay voluntary contributions</a> so that there aren’t gaps in your National Insurance Contributions record if you return to the UK. </p>


</article><article id="tax"><header><h1>Part 5: Tax</h1>
  </header><p>Depending on your residency status (ie whether you’ll be a permanent or temporary resident, or something else) in the country you’re going to, you might still have to pay UK income tax.</p>

<p>Fill in Form P85 to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> that you’ve left or are about to leave the UK to live or work abroad.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will tell you if you’re owed a tax refund and will work out if you’ll become ‘non-resident’ in the UK and how this affects your tax.</p>
