  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="checks-on-your-vehicle"><header><h1>Part 1: Checks on your vehicle</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re a commercial driver, you might be asked to stop by the police or a Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) officer. They can stop lorries, buses and coaches.</p>

<p>The police and <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> have the power to carry out spot checks on your vehicle and issue <a href="/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers/roadside-prohibitions" title="roadside prohibitions">prohibitions</a> if necessary. If there’s a problem with your vehicle, a prohibition prevents you from driving until you get it fixed.</p>

<p>Police and <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> officers can also issue <a href="/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers/fixed-penalties" title="fixed penalties">fixed penalties</a> if you commit an offence. Some of these are graduated depending on the circumstances and seriousness of the offence.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>It’s your responsibility to make sure your vehicle is <a href="/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers/making-sure-your-vehicle-is-roadworthy" title="making sure your vehicle is roadworthy">roadworthy</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to recognise a <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> officer</h2>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> officers wear yellow visibility jackets with the <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> logo and they’ll always carry a <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> warrant.</p>

<p>Their vehicles are marked with a black and yellow print on the side and a <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> logo on the bonnet.</p>

<h2>What happens when you’re stopped</h2>

<p>The checks are carried out either at the roadside or dedicated testing
sites. The checks are used to keep unsafe vehicles off the road.</p>

<p>The officer checks that the vehicle isn’t breaking any rules and regulations. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>checking authorised load weights and type of load permitted</li>
  <li>checking vehicles for roadworthiness and mechanical faults</li>
  <li>looking at your tachograph records</li>
  <li>making sure you have a valid <a href="/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers/driving-without-a-valid-operators-licence" title="driving without a valid operator's licence">occupational driving licence</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>If you commit a series of serious offences, your vehicle could be impounded.</p>

<p>Foreign-registered vehicles are subject to the same rules as vehicles registered in the UK.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re carrying a high-value load you can keep your engine running, doors locked and windows closed until you’re sure you’ve been stopped by a genuine police or <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> officer.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you don’t stop</h2>

<p>Not stopping when asked to by a uniformed officer is an offence. The incident will be officially recorded and you’ll be interviewed later on. </p>

<p>You may then face court action or be reported to the Traffic Commissioner, who may remove or suspend your operator’s licence.</p>


</article><article id="making-sure-your-vehicle-is-roadworthy"><header><h1>Part 2: Making sure your vehicle is roadworthy</h1>
  </header><p>You’re responsible for maintaining the roadworthiness of your vehicle. This will help avoid problems with vehicle checks.</p>

<h2>Driver responsibilities</h2>

<p>You must ensure your vehicle is safe to drive before setting off on a journey. You should carry out a walkaround check of the vehicle before your journey and check the:</p>

<ul>
<li>lights</li>
  <li>tyres</li>
  <li>wheel fixings</li>
  <li>bodywork</li>
  <li>trailer coupling</li>
  <li>load and other equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>You’re also responsible for reporting any defects in writing to whoever’s in charge of sorting out vehicle defects in your organisation. Reports should include the:</p>

<ul>
<li>vehicle registration or identification mark</li>
  <li>date of inspection</li>
  <li>details of the defects</li>
  <li>name of the person reporting the defects</li>
</ul>
<h2>Operator responsibilities</h2>

<p>You must carry out safety inspections before you use a vehicle for the first time - even if you’re just leasing, hiring or borrowing them.</p>

<p>You must also:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure that regular safety inspections are made</li>
  <li>give drivers clear written instructions of their responsibilities so they understand what they should do</li>
  <li>have a system to ensure that non-roadworthy vehicles are taken out of service</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Safety inspections must be carried out by trained inspectors with a good knowledge of the appropriate Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) inspection manuals.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="roadside-prohibitions"><header><h1>Part 3: Roadside prohibitions</h1>
  </header><p>You could be given a prohibition by a police officer or an officer from the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>). You could either get an immediate or delayed prohibition, depending on how dangerous your vehicle is before the faults are fixed.</p>

<h2>Immediate prohibition</h2>
<p>If you get a prohibition that comes into effect immediately, it’s likely that your vehicle will be <a href="/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers/what-happens-if-your-vehicle-is-immobilised" title="immobilised">immobilised</a> and you won’t be able to drive it. You could also be prosecuted.</p>

<h2>Delayed prohibition</h2>
<p>If you get a prohibition with a delayed effect, you’ll be able to drive your vehicle away and the operator will have up to 10 days to get it fixed. It will then need to be reinspected and the prohibition removed before it can be used on the road again.</p>

<h2>Types of prohibition</h2>

<p>Some of the prohibitions that could be placed on your vehicle are listed below.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you get a prohibition notice, make sure it’s given to the vehicle operator and owner. The details of how to clear it are on the back of it.</p>
</div>

<h3>Overload prohibition notice</h3>

<p>If your vehicle is overloaded then you will be issued with an immediate prohibition notice and your vehicle may be immobilised. Examiners can also direct the vehicle to somewhere nearby, where the load can be redistributed or removed.</p>

<p>A copy of the notice is sent to the owner or operator of the vehicle.</p>

<h3>Roadworthiness prohibition (PG9)</h3>

<p>This is given for mechanical problems or for the condition of a vehicle’s bodywork and equipment. It could have an immediate or delayed effect depending on how severe the defect is.</p>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has published a list of defects explaining whether immediate or delayed prohibitions are issued.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/repository/Categorisation%20of%20Defects.pdf" title="Download 'List of vehicle defects and prohibitions' (PDF, 455KB)" rel="external">Download ‘List of vehicle defects and prohibitions’ (PDF, 455KB)</a></p>
</div>

<h3>‘S’ marked roadworthiness prohibition</h3>

<p>This is given when the examiner believes a severe defect is due to significant breakdown in the vehicle’s maintenance procedures.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t get this type of prohibition for defects you can’t have known about before your journey, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>a problem that could have occurred during the journey</li>
  <li>a problem you couldn’t reasonably have been expected to have noticed (eg an underside defect)</li>
</ul>
<p>You could get an ‘S’ marked prohibition if the examiner believes there’s been a significant breakdown in the maintenance procedures agreed as part of the operator’s licence. </p>

<p>The prohibition can start immediately and you or the operator could be prosecuted. <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> will follow up with an assessment of the operator’s maintenance procedures.</p>

<h3>Variation of roadworthiness prohibition</h3>

<p>You could get this if an immediate problem with your vehicle has been temporarily or permanently fixed at the roadside but others remain. </p>

<p>It means you can return to your operating centre or garage to permanently repair the initial problem and other faults.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
If a damaged vehicle wing is in danger of falling off a vehicle - and is a potential road safety hazard - the examiner would give you an immediate prohibition notice. However, they might be satisfied if you can temporarily secure the wing back in place. </p>

<p>The examiner can then give you a ‘variation of roadworthiness prohibition’ - changing an immediate notice to a delayed one.</p>
</div>

<h3>Drivers’ hours prohibition</h3>

<p>You get this if you haven’t followed the rules for <a href="/drivers-hours" title="drivers hours">drivers’ hours</a> and <a href="/tachographs" title="tachographs">tachographs</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll usually get a fine - but you could also be prosecuted or have your vehicle immobilised.</p>

<h3>Hazchem prohibition</h3>

<p>This is given when a problem with carrying dangerous goods is found. Fixing the problem is usually enough to get the prohibition lifted.</p>


</article><article id="driving-without-a-valid-operators-licence"><header><h1>Part 4: Driving without a valid operator's licence</h1>
  </header><p>You need a valid operator’s licence if you drive the following for any type of business:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a href="/psv-operator-licences" title="operator licences for public service vehicles">public service vehicle</a>
</li>
  <li>a <a href="/being-a-goods-vehicle-operator" title="operator licences for heavy goods vehicles">heavy goods vehicle</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>If you or your employer don’t have a valid operator’s licence, your vehicle could be impounded and scrapped after 21 days unless you or your employer appeal to the local <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/contactus/vosalocationsandofficesofthetrafficcommissioners/centralisedlicensingunitandofficesofthetrafficcommissioners.htm" title="Traffic Commissioners' offices">Traffic Commissioner.</a></p>

<p>Appeals can only be made when:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can prove that the vehicle was seized wrongly (ie you or your employer had an operator’s licence when it was seized) </li>
  <li>the vehicle was exempt from operator licensing when it was impounded</li>
  <li>the vehicle was being used illegally without the owner’s knowledge</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you appeal and the Traffic Commissioner rules that the impounding was correct, your vehicle may still be scrapped.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="fixed-penalties"><header><h1>Part 5: Fixed penalties</h1>
  </header><p>If you get a fixed penalty from a <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> officer or the police, the amount you have to pay could depend on the circumstances and seriousness of the offence.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>If your vehicle exceeds its maximum permitted axle weight, the penalties are:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Vehicle overweight by</th>
      <th>Penalty</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5% to 10%</td>
      <td>£60</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>10% to 15%</td>
      <td>£120</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>15% to 30%</td>
      <td>£200</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>more than 30%</td>
      <td>Court summons</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For drivers’ hours offences, the penalties are:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Maximum daily driving time exceeded by</th>
      <th>Penalty</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Up to an hour</td>
      <td>£60</td>

<tr>
<td>1 to 2 hours</td>

<tr>
<td>2 or more hours</td>

    </tr>
</tbody>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has published a guide to fixed penalties as well as a policy for road traffic offences, which includes a list of offences and penalty fine levels.</p>

</div>

<h2>Endorsements to your driving licence</h2>

<p>For some offences, you’ll get points added to your licence (endorsements) as well as a fine. For example, if your vehicle has defective brakes, you’ll be given a £60 fine and 3 points on your licence.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the offence is endorsable, you must present your driving licence within 14 days.</p>
</div>

<h2>Fixed penalty notices</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must have a UK address you can be easily contacted through. B&amp;B, hotel, agency or solicitor addresses aren’t normally accepted.</p>
</div>

<p>If you have a satisfactory UK address, you’ll have 28 days from when you’re given a fixed penalty notice to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay the fine</li>
  <li>ask for a court hearing if you want to appeal</li>
</ul>
<p>In Scotland, you’ll get a ‘conditional offer’ instead of a fixed penalty notice. You get 28 days from the date of issue to pay the fine. After this, you could be prosecuted if you don’t pay.</p>

<h3>If you don’t have a satisfactory UK address</h3>

<p>You’ll have to pay a ‘financial penalty deposit’. This will be either:</p>

<ul>
<li>the total of all fixed penalty notices issued (if you want to appeal, you must do so within 28 days)</li>
  <li>£300 per offence if you go to court (this depends on the seriousness and number of offences - you’ll have to pay on the spot and and go to court later)</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases the maximum amount you’ll have to pay as a deposit is £900. You have to pay this straight away - if you don’t, you might not be allowed to drive your vehicle.</p>

<p>The money from deposits is used to pay any fixed penalties or court fines. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll be refunded any money left over from your deposit after fines have been paid.</p>
</div>

<p>If you don’t pay the deposit, your vehicle will be <a href="/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers/what-happens-if-your-vehicle-is-immobilised" title="what happens if your vehicle is immobilised">immobilised</a>.</p>


</article><article id="what-happens-if-your-vehicle-is-immobilised"><header><h1>Part 6: What happens if your vehicle is immobilised</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re stopped by a Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) officer or the police, they might immobilise your vehicle.</p>

<p>This might happen if you’ve committed a serious enough offence to get an <a href="/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers/roadside-prohibitions" title="immediate prohibition">‘immediate prohibition’</a>. </p>

<p>An immediate prohibition is used to prevent risks to road safety (eg an unroadworthy vehicle or a tired driver). It means you won’t be able to drive your vehicle until the problem is sorted out. </p>

<h2>When your vehicle could be immobilised</h2>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> or the police can also immobilise your vehicle at the roadside if an immediate prohibiton is issued for any of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’ve broken the rules on drivers’ hours and tachographs</li>
  <li>your vehicle isn’t roadworthy</li>
  <li>your vehicle is overloaded</li>
  <li>you’ve been given a fixed penalty notice but can’t or won’t pay a financial penalty deposit</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all vehicles given an immediate prohibition will be immobilised. Special circumstances will be considered, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>the type of load you’re carrying</li>
  <li>if you’re carrying passengers on a public service vehicle who’d be inconvenienced if it was immobilised</li>
</ul>
<h2>How your vehicle is immobilised</h2>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> and the police use a steel cable secured by a padlock to immobilise vehicles. It’s fitted around the wheels of the vehicle and a warning notice is attached to the vehicle.</p>

<p>The notice tells you how to get the vehicle released. You have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>satisfy <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> that the causes of the immediate prohibitions have been dealt with </li>
  <li>pay an £80 release charge </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>It’s an offence to remove the warning notice or interfere with the immobilising device.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has produced a guide to vehicle immobilisation with more information, including advice on how to avoid it.</p>
