<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Electronic Recording and Reporting of Fishing Activity Scheme (<abbr title="Electronic recording system">ERS</abbr>) project is a joint exercise of the UK fisheries administrations to comply with <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/documents/1224-2009.pdf">European Council Regulation 1224/2009 (PDF 1.8MB)</a>. This requires sales notes and logbook data to be submitted electronically to fishing authorities.</p>

<p>This guide explains how the new regulations will affect buyers and sellers of first sale fish and masters of fishing vessels. It describes what you should do to comply, how to submit your information electronically and key deadlines for different sizes and types of vessel.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-electronic-sales-notes">What are electronic sales notes?</h2>

<p>Under the regulation, it is compulsory for buyers and sellers with an annual turnover of over €200,000 to submit sales notes of first sale fish electronically.</p>

<p>Buyers and sellers with an annual turnover below €200,000 can also submit sales notes electronically if they choose to.</p>

<p>You should do this by registering with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fishregister.gov.uk">www.fishregister.gov.uk</a>, the UK fisheries administrations’ electronic reporting system. You should complete <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/forms/rbs5.pdf">RBS 5: Access to online electronic salesnote system (PDF 186KB)</a> to register.</p>

<p>You will then be able to make electronic submissions on the site.</p>

<p>On the site you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>submit electronic sales notes of first sale fish to the relevant UK fisheries administration</li>
  <li>manage sales notes (registered companies only)</li>
  <li>submit takeover declarations </li>
</ul>
<p>The website also has:</p>

<ul>
<li>a searchable vessel register and register of buyers and sellers</li>
  <li>registration forms and guidance for buyers and sellers of first sale fish</li>
</ul>
<p>When you log on to the register, it will use your user name to retrieve your details and save you time in completing and submitting sales notes. The system will then securely store your submissions for you to access in the future.</p>

<p>The basic unit of transmission is the sales note line. Each line provides for identifying the landed catch including grade, price and size as well as the port of landing, date, landing ID and the identity of the vessel landing the fish.</p>

<p>If you submit data electronically through the site you will no longer be required to provide paper copies of sales notes.</p>

<p>You can find out further information on how to use the site by contacting the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> IT Helpdesk on Tel 0191 376 2661, or emailing them at <a href="mailto:it.helpdesk@marinemanagement.org.uk">it.helpdesk@marinemanagement.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-electronic-logbooks">What are electronic logbooks?</h2>

<p>An electronic logbook (eLogbook) is software installed on your fishing vessel that allows you to electronically record and submit the fishing activity of your vessel.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Council Regulation 1224/2009 requires all vessels registered in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to submit their fishing activity electronically in this way.</p>

<p>eLogbooks will replace paper logbooks, which will be withdrawn. Vessels will have to submit all daily activity by midnight each day. This applies whether a vessel is fishing or not during the voyage, and in any waters.</p>

<p>Approved logbook software has been available in the UK since May 2010. Vessels over 24 metres overall length have been electronic logbook only since 8 April 2012.</p>

<p>Vessels between 15 and 24 metres overall length will need to be compliant by the following dates:</p>

<ul>
<li>vessels that fish outside European Community (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) waters should have the software installed by 1 January 2011</li>
  <li>vessels that do not fish outside <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> waters should have the software installed by 1 July 2011</li>
</ul>
<p>Approved software has been through an extensive testing process commissioned by the UK fisheries administrations testing agent, NCC Group. This is to ensure that it meets the published specification required to communicate with the central system – the UK Hub.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/documents/elb_questions.pdf">download eLogbooks questions and answers from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website (PDF 54KB)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="key-dates-for-electronic-record-requirements">Key dates for electronic record requirements</h2>

<p>Under the regulation European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) member states must implement the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>electronic sales notes from 1 January 2009</li>
  <li>electronic logbooks from 1 January 2010 for vessels over 24 metres overall length</li>
  <li>electronic logbooks from 1 January 2011 for vessel over 15 metres overall length that operate exclusively outside of Community waters</li>
  <li>electronic logbooks from 1 July 2011 for vessels over 15 metres overall length</li>
  <li>electronic logbooks from 1 January 2012 for vessels over 12 metres overall length</li>
  <li>there will still need to be paper logbook records kept for vessels 12 metres or less in length and paper sales notes for companies with a turnover of less than €200,000 a year</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful implementation of the regulation will mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>compliance with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and UK regulations real-time catch information from eLogbooks, leading to improved data quality as well as onward marketing of their catch (traceability)</li>
  <li>access to electronic records on catch as well as fish sold</li>
  <li>the availability of cumulative data for the UK fishing industry</li>
  <li>more effective monitoring, control and surveillance operations as a result of being able to cross-check landing declarations and sales notes more quickly and comprehensively to establish the origin of fish</li>
  <li>improved data sharing between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states and third countries</li>
  <li>a better data set of fishing activity maintained by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states and third countries</li>
  <li>online registration of buyers and sellers</li>
  <li>improved data quality and more timely monitoring of quotas as a consequence of reduction of the current requirement for considerable re-entry of data by the UK fisheries administrations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-of-electronic-records-on-registered-buyers-or-sellers-of-first-sale-fish">Impact of electronic records on registered buyers or sellers of first sale fish</h2>

<p>If you are a registered buyer or seller with an annual turnover in fishery products of more than €200,000, you are required to record and submit your records of first sales of fish to the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> by electronic means. You will no longer have to submit paper copies of sales notes.</p>

<p>You will also be able to record and submit your sales note electronically even if your turnover in fisheries products is below €200,000. If you choose to do this you will not have to submit paper copies.</p>

<p>If you already have electronic records or a database containing the information, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will provide you with a submission format and codes to use to transmit that information to them. You will then be able to email the information in line with the requirement to submit sales notes within 48 hours of completion of sale.</p>

<p>If you do not currently have electronic records or databases, you can use the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fishregister.gov.uk">www.fishregister.gov.uk</a> to enter and submit individual sales notes electronically. </p>

<h3 id="take-over-declarations">Take-over declarations</h3>

<p>Under current <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules, where fish is landed but is not offered for sale or is intended for sale at a later date, the owner of the fish or their agent (“the holder”) must complete and submit a take-over declaration. This document must contain similar information to the sales note information (except for the price paid) and must also indicate the place where the products are stored. Under the new regulations the ‘holder’ of the fish, must submit this information to fisheries administrations by electronic means.</p>

<p>Please note: These regulations do not change the actual requirement for information to be provided on a sales note or the deadlines for submission of information.</p>

<h2 id="impact-of-electronic-records-on-fishing-vessel-owners-and-masters">Impact of electronic records on fishing vessel owners and masters</h2>

<p>If you are a master of a fishing vessel you are required to record and submit logbooks, transhipment and landing declarations electronically from the following dates:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 January 2010, if your vessel is over 24 metres in overall length</li>
  <li>1 July 2011, if your vessel is between 15 and 24 metres in overall length</li>
  <li>1 January 2012, if your vessel is over 12 metres overall length</li>
</ul>
<p>You will no longer have to complete paper copies of these documents. Also, when landing abroad you will no longer have to provide copies to that country’s authorities. Instead, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will forward copies to them of the relevant electronic logbooks (eLogbooks) and landing declarations.</p>

<p>The official logbook for vessels using eLogbooks will now lie with fisheries administrations, rather than on board the vessel.</p>
