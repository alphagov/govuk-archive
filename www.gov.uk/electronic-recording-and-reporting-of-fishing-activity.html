<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Electronic Recording and Reporting of Fishing Activity project is a joint exercise of the UK fisheries administrations to comply with European Commission Regulation 1077/2008. This requires sales notes and logbook data to be submitted electronically to fishing authorities. </p>

<p>This guide explains how the new regulations will affect buyers and sellers of first sale fish and masters of fishing vessels. It describes what you should do to comply, how to submit your information electronically and key deadlines for different sizes and types of vessel.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-esales-notes">What are eSales notes?</h2>

<p>Under European Commission Regulation 1077/2008, it is compulsory for buyers and sellers with an annual turnover of over €400,000 to submit sales notes of first sale fish electronically.</p>

<p>Buyers and sellers with an annual turnover below €400,000 can also submit sales notes electronically if they choose to.</p>

<p>You should do this by registering with the Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) Electronic Reporting System (the ‘Fish Register’), and submitting your information via the website. Make electronic submissions on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fishregister.gov.uk/Home.aspx">Fish Register website</a>.</p>

<p>On the site you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>electronically submit sales notes of first sale fish to the relevant UK fisheries authority</li>
  <li>manage sales notes (registered companies only)</li>
  <li>submit takeover declarations </li>
</ul>
<p>The website also has:</p>

<ul>
<li>a searchable vessel register and register of buyers and sellers</li>
  <li>registration forms and guidance for buyers and sellers of first sale fish</li>
</ul>
<p>When you log on to the register, it will use your user name to retrieve your details and save you time in completing and submitting sales notes. The system will then store your submissions securely for you to access for your own purposes at any future date.</p>

<p>The basic unit of transmission is the Sales Note line. Each line provides the identification of the landed catch including grade, price and size as well as the port of landing, date, landing id and the identity of the vessel landing the fish.</p>

<p>If you submit data electronically through the site you will no longer be required to provide paper copies of sales notes.</p>

<p>You can find out further information on how to use the site by contacting the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> IT Helpdesk on Tel 0191 376 2661, or emailing them at <a href="mailto:it.helpdesk@marinemanagement.org.uk">it.helpdesk@marinemanagement.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-elogbooks">What are eLogbooks?</h2>

<p>An electronic logbook (eLogbook) is software installed on your fishing vessel that allows you to electronically record and submit the fishing activity of your vessel.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Council Regulations 1966/2006, 1006/2008, Commission Regulation 1077/2007 and Council Regulation 1224/2009 require all vessels registered in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to submit their fishing activity electronically in this way.</p>

<p>eLogbooks will replace paper logbooks, which will be withdrawn. Vessels will have to submit all daily activity by midnight each day. This applies whether a vessel is fishing or not during the voyage, and in any waters.</p>

<p>Approved logbook software has been available in the UK since May 2010. The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> expects owners of vessels over 24 metres overall length to show their intention to comply no later than 1 October 2010. This should be by either having approved software installed and working, or by being able to provide evidence of taking specific steps to have a system installed.</p>

<p>Vessels between 15 and 24 metres overall length will need to be compliant by the following dates:</p>

<ul>
<li>vessels that fish outside European Community (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) waters should have the software installed by 1 January 2011</li>
  <li>vessels that do not fish outside <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> waters should have the software installed by 1 July 2011</li>
</ul>
<p>Grant aid is currently available towards the cost of the eLogbook software for vessels over 15 metres overall length. You can download the eLogbook grant claim form (ELB3) from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/forms/elb3.pdf"><abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website (PDF, 177KB)</a>.</p>

<p>Only approved software is eligible for grant. Approved software has been through an extensive testing process to ensure that it meets the published specification required to communicate with the central UK Hub.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/documents/elb_questions.pdf">download eLogbooks frequently-asked questions from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website (PDF, 45KB)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="key-dates-for-electronic-record-requirements">Key dates for electronic record requirements</h2>

<p>Under European Commission Regulation 1077/2008, European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) member states must implement the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Electronic sales notes (eSales Notes) - these have been in operation since 1 January 2009. </li>
  <li>Electronic logbooks (eLogbooks) - these must have been implemented for vessels over 24 metres since 1 January 2010, and should be implemented for vessels between 15 and 24 metres from 1 July 2011. </li>
</ul>
<p>Paper logbook records will still need to be kept for vessels 15 metres or less in length, and paper sales notes for companies with a turnover of less then €400,000 a year.</p>

<p>Successful implementation of the regulation will mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>compliance with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and UK regulations real-time catch information from eLogbooks, leading to improved data quality as well as onward marketing of their catch (traceability)</li>
  <li>access to electronic records on catch as well as fish sold</li>
  <li>the availability of cumulative data for the UK fishing industry</li>
  <li>more effective monitoring, control and surveillance operations as a result of being able to cross-check landing declarations and sales notes more quickly and comprehensively to establish the origin of fish</li>
  <li>improved data sharing between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states and third countries</li>
  <li>a better data set of fishing activity maintained by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states and third countries</li>
  <li>online registration of buyers and sellers</li>
  <li>improved data quality and more timely monitoring of quotas as a consequence of reduction of the current requirement for considerable re-entry of data by the UK fisheries administrations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-of-electronic-records-on-registered-buyers-or-sellers-of-first-sale-fish">Impact of electronic records on registered buyers or sellers of first sale fish</h2>

<p>If you are a registered buyer or seller with an annual turnover in fishery products of more than €400,000 (around £240,000), you are required to record and submit your records of first sales of fish to the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> by electronic means. You will no longer have to submit paper copies of sales notes.</p>

<p>You will also be able to record and submit your sales note electronically even if your turnover in fisheries products is below €400,000. If you choose to do this you will not have to submit paper copies.</p>

<p>If you already have electronic records or a database containing the information, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will provide you with a submission format and codes to use to transmit that information to them. You will then be able to email the information in line with the requirement to submit sales notes within 48 hours of completion of sale.</p>

<p>If you do not currently have electronic records or databases, you can use the Fish Register to enter and submit individual sales notes electronically. </p>

<h3 id="take-over-declarations">Take-over declarations</h3>

<p>Under current European Union rules, where fish is landed but is not offered for sale or is intended for sale at a later date, the ‘holder’ of the fish (the owner or their agent) must complete and submit a take-over declaration. This document must contain similar information to the sales note information (except for the price paid) and must also indicate the place where the products are stored.</p>

<p>Under the new regulations take-over declarations must be submitted electronically.</p>

<p>Please note that the new regulations do not change the actual requirement for information to be provided on a sales note or the deadlines for submission of information.</p>

<h2 id="impact-of-electronic-records-on-fishing-vessel-owners-and-masters">Impact of electronic records on fishing vessel owners and masters</h2>

<p>If you are a master of a fishing vessel you are required to record and submit logbooks, transhipment and landing declarations electronically from the following dates:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 January 2010, if your vessel is over 24 metres in overall length</li>
  <li>1 July 2011, if your vessel is between 15 and 24 metres in overall length</li>
</ul>
<p>You will no longer have to complete paper copies of these documents. Also, when landing abroad you will no longer have to provide copies to that country’s authorities. Instead, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will forward copies to them of the relevant electronic logbooks (eLogbooks) and landing declarations.</p>

<p>The official logbook for vessels using eLogbooks will now lie with fisheries administrations, rather than on board the vessel.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> may also decide to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply the rules earlier than the above dates.</li>
  <li>Require or allow smaller vessels to use eLogbooks and landing declarations.</li>
  <li>Exempt day boats (vessels carrying out fishing trips of 24 hours or less) from the need to complete logbooks and landing declarations electronically if they fish exclusively within British fishery limits. These vessels would have to continue completing paper copies of the forms.  </li>
</ul>
