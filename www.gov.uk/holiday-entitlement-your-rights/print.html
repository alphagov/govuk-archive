  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Workers are legally entitled to 5.6 weeks paid holiday per year (otherwise known as statutory leave entitlement or annual leave). </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Self-employed workers aren’t entitled to annual leave.</p>
</div>

<h2>Working 5 days a week</h2>

<p>Anyone who works a 5-day week, must receive 28 days paid statutory leave per year. This is calculated by multiplying a normal week (5 days) by the 5.6 entitlement.  </p>

<p>An employer can choose to include bank or public holidays as part of statutory leave. </p>

<h2>Working part-time</h2>

<p>Part-time, workers are still entitled to get their normal working week in paid holiday. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
If an employee works 3 days a week, their leave is calculated by multiplying 3 by 5.6 which comes to 16.8 days of annual paid leave.</p>
</div>

<h2>Irregular hours</h2>

<p>If someone works irregular hours - eg shift work - they will need to <a href="/holiday-entitlement-if-you-work-irregular-hours" title="Holiday entitlement if you work irregular hours">calculate their leave entitlement for irregular hours</a>. </p>

<h2>Limits on statutory leave</h2>

<p>The maximum amount of paid statutory leave a worker can have over one leave year is 28 days. This also applies to staff who work a 6-day week. An employer can choose to offer more leave as part of the contract of employment.  </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><a href="/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement" title="Calculate your statutory leave">Calculate statutory leave</a> to work out how much someone is entitled to.</p>
</div>

<h2>Contractual holiday entitlement</h2>

<p>An employer can choose to offer more leave than the legal minimum, which they may apply different rules to, eg the amount of time someone must be employed before their entitled to it.</p>

<p>This is known as contractual holiday entitlement and it must be clearly detailed in the staff employment contract, company handbook or intranet site.  </p>

<h2>Other holiday rights for employees</h2>

<p>Employees also have the right to:</p>

<ul>
<li>get paid for leave - the rate will depend on your circumstances</li>
  <li>build up holiday entitlement during maternity, paternity and adoption leave </li>
</ul>
<h2>Disputes</h2>

<p>Paid annual leave is a legal right that an employer must provide their employees.  </p>

<p>If an employee thinks their right to leave and pay are not being met they can <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute" title="Solve a workplace dispute">speak to their employer</a> or their trade union representative. </p>

</article><article id="bank-and-public-holidays"><header><h1>Part 2: Bank and public holidays</h1>
  </header><p><a href="/bank-holidays" title="Find out when UK bank and public holidays are">Bank or public holidays</a> do not have to be given as paid leave. An employer can choose to include these holidays as part of their staff’s statutory paid annual leave.</p>

</article><article id="holiday-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: Holiday pay</h1>
  </header><p>Workers are entitled to a week’s pay for each week of leave they take. </p>

<p>A week’s pay is worked out according to the kind of hours an employee works: </p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Working pattern</th>
      <th>Pay</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Fixed hours and pay</td>
      <td>A week’s holiday pay equals how much an employee gets for a week’s work (excluding non-guaranteed overtime payments)</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Shift work</td>
      <td>A week’s holiday pay equals the average weekly hours an employee worked in the previous 12 weeks at their average hourly rate</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Abnormal working hours</td>
      <td>A week’s holiday pay is the average pay an employee got over the previous 12 weeks (in which they were paid)</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Calculating average hourly rate</h2>

<p>To calculate average hourly rate, only the hours worked and how much was paid for them should be counted.  </p>

<h2>Rolled-up holiday pay</h2>

<p>Holiday pay should be paid for the time when annual leave is taken. An employer cannot include an amount for holiday pay in the hourly rate (known as ‘rolled-up holiday pay’). If a current contract still includes rolled-up pay, it needs to re-negotiated.</p>

</article><article id="calculate-leave-entitlement"><header><h1>Part 4: Calculate leave entitlement</h1>
  </header><p>Annual leave begins to build up (‘accrue’) as soon as an employee starts their job.</p>

<p>An employer can use a ‘leave year’ or an ‘accrual’ system to work out how much leave their staff should get. </p>

<h2>Leave year</h2>

<p>An employer must tell their staff the dates of their leave year as soon as they start working, eg it might run from 1 January to 31 December. </p>

<p>Employees must take their leave during this time. If a leave year isn’t set out in a contract then it will start: </p>

<ul>
<li>on the 1st day of a new job (if started after 1 October 1998)</li>
  <li>on 1 October (if started on or before 1 October 1998)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Leave entitlement when starting a new job</h3>

<p>If an employee starts their job part-way through a leave year, they’re only entitled to part of their total leave for the year. What they get depends on how much of the year is left. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement" title="calculate your holiday entitlement">holiday entitlement calculator</a> to work out how much leave someone has left.</p>
</div>

<h2>Accrual system</h2>

<p>An employer can use an accrual system to work out an employee’s leave during the first year of the job. Under this system, an employee gets one twelfth of their leave in each month. So by the 3rd month they’d be entitled to a quarter of of their total leave, eg 7 days out of 28 for a 5-day week.</p>

<h2>Carrying over leave</h2>

<p>Staff who work a 5-day week must use at least 20 out of their 28 days statutory annual leave. Whether or not they can carry over the remaining 8 days is up to the employer and what is stated in the employment contract. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Carrying over leave isn’t an automatic right and must be negotiated with the employer.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="booking-timeoff"><header><h1>Part 5: Booking time-off </h1>
  </header><p>The notice period for taking leave is at least twice as long as the amount of leave an employee wants to take, eg 2 day’s notice for 1 day’s leave. </p>

<p>An employer can refuse a leave request but they must give as much notice as the amount of leave requested, eg 2 weeks notice if the leave requested was 2 weeks.  </p>

<h2>Part leave days</h2>

<p>Some employees may be entitled to a part leave day -  eg if they’re part-time or have a half day’s leave to take. How a part day should be taken is up to the employer.</p>

<h2>Sickness during leave</h2>

<p>If an employee is ill just before or during their leave, they can <a href="/taking-sick-leave" title="Taking sick leave">take it as sick leave</a>. They should be able to take the missed leave later and should discuss this with their employer.  </p>

<h2>Being asked to take leave</h2>

<p>An employer can tell their staff to take leave, eg bank holidays or Christmas. There may be rules about this in the employment contract or it may be what normally happens in the workplace. The notice period for this is at least twice as long as the leave they want their staff to take.</p>


</article><article id="taking-holiday-before-leaving-a-job"><header><h1>Part 6: Taking holiday before leaving a job</h1>
  </header><p>When an employee leaves their job, their contract will say how long their notice period is. </p>

<p>During the notice period the employee can take whatever is left of their statutory annual leave. </p>

<p>Use the <a href="/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement" title="calculate your holiday entitlement">holiday entitlement calculator</a> to work this out. How much they get depends on how much of the holiday year has passed. </p>

<h2>Taking more leave than the entitlement</h2>

<p>If an employee has taken more leave than they’re entitled to, their employer must not take money from their final pay unless it’s been agreed beforehand. The rules in this situation should be outlined in the employment contract, company handbook or intranet site. </p>

<h2>Getting paid instead of taking holidays</h2>

<p>The only time someone can get paid in place of taking statutory leave (known as ‘payment in lieu’) is when they leave their job.</p>
