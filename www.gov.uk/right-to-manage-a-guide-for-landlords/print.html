  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="the-right-to-manage"><header><h1>Part 1: The Right to Manage</h1>
  </header><p>The Right to Manage (<abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr>) lets some leasehold property owners take over management of the building - even without the agreement of the landlord.</p>

<p>As a landlord, the leaseholders in your building will send you notice if they plan to do this. If they’re successful, you’ll still own the building but they’ll manage it. </p>

<p>This means they’ll be responsible for things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>collecting and managing the service charge</li>
  <li>upkeep of communal areas (eg communal hallways and stairs)</li>
  <li>upkeep of the structure of the building (eg the roof)</li>
  <li>dealing with complaints about the building from other leaseholders</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Qualifying leaseholders can use the Right to Manage for any reason - they don’t have to prove the building has been badly managed.</p>
</div>

<h2>Right to Manage companies</h2>
<p>To use the right, leaseholders must set up an <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company and follow certain procedures. The <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company can manage the building directly, or pay a managing agent to do it.</p>

<p>As landlord, you have the right to be a member of the <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company and to vote on decisions. You get at least 1 vote. How many votes you’ll get depends on how many flats you own in the building. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
There are 20 flats in the block. 16 are owned by leaseholders. 4 are owned by you and rented out on assured shorthold tenancies. You get 4 votes - 1 for each of the flats you own and rent out.</p>
</div>

<p>The <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company must pay for any costs you incur during the management transfer process - even if it doesn’t end up managing the building.</p>


</article><article id="qualifying"><header><h1>Part 2: Qualifying</h1>
  </header><p>To qualify for Right to Manage:</p>

<ul>
<li>the building must be made up of flats (houses don’t qualify)</li>
  <li>at least two-thirds of the flats in the building must be leasehold - with leases that were for more than 21 years when they were granted</li>
  <li>at least 75% of the building must be residential - eg if there’s a shop in the building, it can’t take up more than 25% of the total floor area</li>
  <li>you must live somewhere else if there are less than 4 flats in the block - unless the block was purpose-built as flats, rather than converted from another type of building</li>
  <li>any number of owners can set up an RTM company - but at least half of the flats in the building must be members of the company before it can actually take over management</li>
</ul></article><article id="notices"><header><h1>Part 3: Notices</h1>
  </header><p>Normally, the leaseholders will contact you once they’ve set up an <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company. You may get a ‘right to information’ notice from the company - asking for the information they need in order to claim their Right to Manage. </p>

<h2>You receive a ‘notice of claim’</h2>
<p>If you receive a ‘notice of claim’ it means that the <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company intends to take over management of the building. It will tell you:</p>

<ul>
<li>the date you must respond by</li>
  <li>the date the <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company intends to take over management of the building</li>
</ul>
<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>accept the claim</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/right-to-manage-a-guide-for-landlords/disputing-the-claim" title="If you want to dispute the claim">dispute the claim</a> - the notice of claim will tell you when you need to do this by, but the deadline can’t be less than 1 month from the date of the notice</p>
  </li>
</ul></article><article id="disputing-the-claim"><header><h1>Part 4: Disputing the claim</h1>
  </header><p>You can dispute the claim by serving a counter-notice to the Right to Manage (<abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr>) company. In it, you must give reasons why you think the company isn’t entitled to manage the building. </p>

<p>You can dispute the claim if you think:</p>

<ul>
<li>the building doesn’t qualify</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company doesn’t comply with the legal requirements</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company members don’t represent half the flats in the building</li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t dispute the claim for any other reason.</p>

<h2>Leasehold Valuation Tribunal</h2>
<p>If the members of the <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company think you’re wrong, the company must apply to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal (<abbr title="Leasehold Valuation Tribunal">LVT</abbr>) within 2 months of the date of the counter-notice. The <abbr title="Leasehold Valuation Tribunal">LVT</abbr> will then decide if the <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company can manage the building.</p>


</article><article id="transferring-management-of-the-building"><header><h1>Part 5: Transferring management of the building</h1>
  </header><p>If you accept the Right to Manage (<abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr>) company’s <a href="/right-to-manage-a-guide-for-landlords/notices" title="Right to Manage notices">notice</a>, or if you <a href="/right-to-manage-a-guide-for-landlords/disputing-the-claim" title="Disputing the claim">dispute the claim</a> and the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal (<abbr title="Leasehold Valuation Tribunal">LVT</abbr>) decides against you, the management of the building will transfer to the <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company.</p>

<p>The date the <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company takes over management responsibilities is called the ‘date of acquisition’. This will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>on the date given on the notice of claim - if you accept the claim</li>
  <li>3 months after the <abbr title="Leasehold Valuation Tribunal">LVT</abbr> decision becomes final - if you disputed the claim and lost</li>
  <li>3 months after agreement - if you originally disputed the claim but later came to an agreement with the <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company</li>
</ul>
<p>You must transfer any money you have from service charges on the acquisition date - or as soon after as is reasonably possible.</p>

<h2>Ongoing management</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company must tell you at least 30 days before approving:</p>

<ul>
<li>assignment (selling or transferring the flat into someone else’s name)</li>
  <li>a sublet</li>
  <li>a charge to leaseholders</li>
</ul>
<p>If the lease says your consent is needed, the <abbr title="Right to Manage">RTM</abbr> company must give you 30 days’ notice before approving:</p>

<ul>
<li>any changes to the structure of the building</li>
  <li>any changes to the use of the building</li>
</ul>
<p>For other approvals they must tell you at least 14 days in advance.</p>
