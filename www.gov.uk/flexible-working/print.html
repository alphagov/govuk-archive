  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Applying for flexible working means an employee asking to change their hours or days to suit their needs.</p>

<p>Anyone can ask their employer to work flexibly. However, <a href="/flexible-working/who-can-request-flexible-working" title="Who can request flexible working">some employees</a> have the legal (‘statutory’) right to ask for flexible working. This is also known as ‘making a statutory application’.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must be caring for someone, or expect to care for them, to make a statutory application.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="types-of-flexible-working"><header><h1>Part 2: Types of flexible working</h1>
  </header><p>Flexible working means an employer and employee making an arrangement to work different hours, days or location. There are different ways this can happen.</p>

<h2>Job sharing</h2>
<p>Having two people doing one job.</p>

<h2>Working from home</h2>
<p>It might be possible to do some or all of the work from home.</p>

<h2>Part time</h2>
<p>Working less than full-time hours (usually by working fewer days).</p>

<h2>Compressed hours</h2>
<p>Working the same hours over fewer days.</p>

<h2>Flexitime</h2>
<p>The employee chooses when to start and end work (within agreed limits) but always works a fixed time period (known as ‘core hours’ - for example 10am to 4pm) every day.</p>

<h2>Annualised hours</h2>
<p>The employee’s hours are worked out over a year, with the employee having some flexibility about when they work. There are sometimes ‘core hours’ which the employee regularly works each week, and they work the rest of their hours flexibly or when there’s extra demand at work.</p>

<h2>Staggered hours</h2>
<p>Where there are different start, finish and break times from other workers.</p>

</article><article id="who-can-request-flexible-working"><header><h1>Part 3: Who can request flexible working?</h1>
  </header><p>To qualify to make a statutory request, staff must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be classed as an employee (and not an agency worker or in the armed forces) - find out if they’re eligible by checking their <a href="/employment-status" title="employment status">employment status</a>
</li>
  <li>have worked for the employer for 26 weeks before applying</li>
  <li>not have made a statutory application to work flexibly in the last 12 months</li>
  <li>have (or expect to have) responsibility for a child aged 17 or under </li>
  <li>have (or expect to have) responsibility for a disabled child under 18 who gets <a href="/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit" title="Disability Living Allowance">Disability Living Allowance</a>
</li>
  <li>care for an adult who is a relation or who lives with them</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the employee is eligible, they have the right to ask for flexible working - it doesn’t have to be automatically approved.</p>
</div>

<h3>Parents who can make a request</h3>

<ul>
<li>the mother, father, adopter, guardian, special guardian, foster parent or private foster carer of the child </li>

<h2>Considering applications for flexible working</h2>

</article><article id="making-an-application"><header><h1>Part 4: Making an application</h1>
  </header><p>Employees can apply by:</p>

<ul>
<li>completing a <a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@employ/documents/digitalasset/dg_179564.rtf" title="Flexible working application letter">flexible working application letter (RTF, 1538K)</a>
</li>

</div>

<h2>Application requirements</h2>

<p>The application must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be in writing and dated</li>
  <li>say that the employee either has responsibility as a parent or carer (or expects to have it) – find out which <a href="/flexible-working/who-can-request-flexible-working" title="Who can request flexible working">parents, guardians and carers</a> can make a request</li>

<ul>
<li>include evidence that the employee is a parent or carer</li>
  <li>show why someone else can’t care for the person the employee is responsible for</li>
</ul>
<h2>Withdrawing an application</h2>

<p>Employees should tell the employer in writing as soon as possible if they decide to withdraw their application. The application will be treated as withdrawn if the employee misses 2 meetings (without good reason) that the employer arranges to discuss the request.</p>

<p>If the employee doesn’t provide extra information the employer needs to make the decision, the application might be treated as withdrawn.</p>

<p>If the application is withdrawn, the employee can’t make another application for 12 months.</p>

</article><article id="results-of-an-application"><header><h1>Part 5: Results of an application</h1>
  </header><p>Employers must make the decision about the request based on what effect it will have on the business.</p>

<h2>Agreeing the application</h2>

<p>If the employer agrees, they should give the employee a new contract. The employer should write to the employee within 28 days about this and the date the flexible working will start. </p>

<h2>Reasons for rejecting an application</h2>

<p>Employers can only reject an application for one of the following reasons: </p>

<ul>
<li>extra costs which would damage the business </li>
  <li>an effect on the business’s ability to meet customer demand</li>
  <li>the work can’t be reorganised among other staff</li>
  <li>people couldn’t be recruited to do the work</li>
  <li>an effect on the quality and performance of work done by the company</li>
  <li>a lack of work to do during the proposed working times </li>
  <li>planned structural changes to the business</li>
</ul>
<p>If the employer doesn’t agree to the request, they must have a meeting with the employee to discuss the reasons.</p>

<h2>Arranging a meeting to discuss the application</h2>
<p>The meeting must happen within 28 days of the employer receiving the application. Both the employer and employee should both agree to the date. </p>

<p>If the manager dealing with the application isn’t at work, the 28 day time limit starts when they get back.</p>

<h3>If the employee can’t attend</h3>
<p>The employee must give a reasonable explanation why they can’t attend the meeting. </p>

<p>If they don’t, the employer can treat the application as withdrawn and the employee can’t make another application for 12 months.</p>

<h3>Taking a work colleague or representative (‘rep’) to the meeting</h3>

<p>Employees can bring a work colleague or trade union representative to the meeting. The rep can discuss things with the employer and speak in the meeting but they can’t answer questions on behalf of the employee. </p>

<p>If the colleague or representative can’t make the meeting, it should be rearranged to take place within 7 days of the original date. The employer must allow the work colleague paid time off to attend.</p>

<h3>Letter about the employer’s decision</h3>
<p>The employer must write to the employee within 14 days of the meeting to tell you what the decision is. This time limit can be longer if you both agree.</p>

<p>If the application is rejected, the letter should have the date on and include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the business reasons for refusing</li>
  <li>an explanation of how the business reasons apply to the request</li>
  <li>how to appeal</li>
</ul></article><article id="appealing-against-the-decision"><header><h1>Part 6: Appealing against the decision</h1>
  </header><p>Employees can appeal against the decision for reasons like:</p>

<ul>
<li>the employer didn’t know something important related to the application when they made their decision</li>
  <li>the employee wants to challenge information used by the employer</li>
</ul>
<p>Employees can’t appeal if they only disagree with the business reasons for the rejection.</p>

</div>

<h3>Holding an appeal meeting</h3>

<p>The employer must hold a meeting with the employee within 14 days after the employee has told them they want to appeal. Both sides must agree on the date.</p>

<p>Employees can bring a work colleague or union rep with them to the meeting. The employer must write to the employee saying what the decision is within 14 days of the meeting.</p>

<p>If the employee misses 2 appeal meetings without a good reason, the employer can treat the appeal as withdrawn. The employee won’t be able to make another application for 12 months.</p>

</article><article id="resolving-problems-with-flexible-working-requests"><header><h1>Part 7: Resolving problems with flexible working requests</h1>
  </header><p>If an application or appeal is rejected or the employee has other problems making the application, they should be <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute" title="solve a workplace dispute">resolved with the employer</a>.</p>

<p>As a last resort, employees may be able to make a complaint to an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment tribunals">Employment Tribunal</a> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the employer didn’t follow the correct process when handling the application</li>
  <li>the appeal is refused but the employee still thinks they have grounds for an appeal</li>
  <li>they’re dismissed or are <a href="/discrimination-your-rights" title="Discrimination">treated unfairly</a> (for example refused a promotion or pay rise) because of the application</li>
