  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you become disabled, you have <a href="/rights-disabled-person/overview" title="disability rights">rights</a> to protect you from discrimination. You also might be entitled to certain benefits. </p>

<p>The main disability and sickness benefits are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit" title="Disability Living Allowance">Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/attendance-allowance" title="Attendance Allowance">Attendance Allowance</a></li>
  <li><a href="/employment-support-allowance" title="Employment and Support Allowance">Employment and Support Allowance</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What you’re entitled to depends on your circumstances - use the <a href="/benefits-adviser" title="benefits adviser">benefits adviser</a> tool to see what you might be able to get.</p>

<p>To get any benefits you’re entitled to, you need to register as a disabled person - there’s more information about this on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/2571.aspx?categoryid=155&amp;subcategoryid=155">NHS Choices website.</a></p>

<p>You might also be able to get:</p>

<ul>
<li>certain types of equipment or have adaptations made to your home without paying <a href="/financial-help-disabled/vat-reductions-on-equipment" title="VAT">VAT</a> </li>
  <li><a href="/council-tax/discounts-for-disabled-people" title="Council Tax discounts">Council Tax discounts</a></li>
  <li>a <a href="/free-discount-tv-licence" title="TV licence discount">TV licence discount</a>
</li>
  <li>a free <a href="/vehicle-exempt-from-car-tax" title="free vehicle tax disc">vehicle tax disc</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re in England you can get a <a href="/apply-needs-assessment-social-services" title="health and social care assessment">health and social care assessment</a> to find out what help you can get (eg equipment, home care, day centres) from your local council.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="if-youre-in-employment-and-become-disabled"><header><h1>Part 2: If you're in employment and become disabled</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer can’t discriminate against you because of your disability - you’re <a href="/rights-disabled-person/employment" title="disability rights at work">protected by the Equality Act 2010</a>. </p>

<p>They must also keep your job open for you and can’t put pressure on you to resign just because you’ve become disabled. </p>

<h2>Reasonable adjustments</h2>

<p>Your employer must make ‘reasonable adjustments’ for you so that you’re not disadvantaged compared to non-disabled people.</p>

<p>This could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a phased return to work – eg working flexible hours or part-time</li>
  <li>time off for medical treatment or counselling</li>
  <li>giving another employee tasks you can’t easily do</li>
  <li>providing practical aids and technical equipment for you</li>
</ul>
<h2>Time off from work</h2>

<p>If you’re an employee and can’t work because of your disability, you may be able to get <a href="/statutory-sick-pay-ssp" title="Statutory Sick Pay">Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>)</a>. Some employers have their own sick pay scheme instead.</p>

<p>If you still can’t work after 28 weeks, or you can’t get Statutory Sick Pay, you can apply for <a href="/employment-support-allowance" title="Employment and Support Allowance">Employment and Support Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>Time off from work should not be recorded as an ‘absence from work’ if you’re waiting for your employer to put reasonable adjustments in place.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Check your <a href="/employment-status" title="employment status">employment status</a> if you’re not sure whether you’re an employee or not.</p>
</div>

<h2>Dismissals and redundancy</h2>

<p>Your employer can’t dismiss you just because you’ve become disabled. </p>

<p>You can be dismissed if your disability means you can’t do your job even with reasonable adjustments. </p>

<p>You can’t be selected for <a href="/redundant-your-rights" title="redundancy your rights">redundancy</a> just because you’re disabled.</p>
