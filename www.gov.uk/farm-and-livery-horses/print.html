</header><article id="looking-after-horses"><header><h1>Part 1: Looking after horses</h1>
  </header><p>A horse is considered to be an agricultural animal if it is used to farm agricultural land or is farmed for meat or hides.</p>

<p>Horses on farms or in stables and livery yards are protected by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/45/contents" title="Animal Welfare Act">Animal Welfare Act.</a> If you own or are responsible for a horse, you have a duty to look after its basic welfare by:</p>

<ul>
<li>providing it with a suitable place to live</li>
  <li>giving it a suitable diet</li>
  <li>protecting it from pain, injury, suffering and disease</li>
  <li>making sure it can behave normally and naturally</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can be fined up to £20,000 or sent to prison for up to 6 months if you are cruel to an animal or don’t care for it properly. You may also be banned from owning animals in future.</p>
</div>

<p>The standards for looking after horses on farms or in livery yards are set out in the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) ‘Code of Practice for the Welfare of Horses, Ponies, Donkeys and their Hybrids’. </p>

</article><article id="dealing-with-waste"><header><h1>Part 3: Dealing with waste</h1>
  </header><h2>Horse manure</h2>
<p>Horse manure is not considered waste if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is used as soil fertiliser</li>
  <li>it is used lawfully for spreading on clearly identified pieces of agricultural land</li>
  <li>it is only stored to be used for spreading on agricultural land</li>
</ul>
<p>If you store or spread horse waste near to water, it can be a health hazard and could harm the environment. You will need to follow rules on <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/54714.aspx" title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">Nitrate Vulnerable Zones</a> and follow <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/regulation/31881.aspx" title="groundwater directives">rules on the pollution of groundwater.</a></p>

<h2>Getting rid of solid waste</h2>

<p>Solid waste includes things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>contaminated bedding</li>
  <li>food containers</li>
  <li>horse manure (if not used as soil fertiliser)</li>
  <li>empty pesticide and other chemical containers</li>
  <li>plastics such as silage wrap, bags and sheets</li>
  <li>tyres, batteries, clinical waste, old machinery and oil</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must use a licensed facility to get rid of solid waste - it’s against the law to dump or burn it.</p>

</article><article id="transporting-horses"><header><h1>Part 4: Transporting horses</h1>
  </header><p>All horses, ponies and donkeys must have a <a href="/horse-passport" title="getting and using a horse passport">horse passport.</a> Horses cannot be transported or exported without their passports.</p>

<h2>Fallen stock</h2>

<p>If a horse dies or has to be put down on your premises, you will have to arrange its disposal as fallen stock under <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/byproducts/" title="animal by-products controls">animal by-products (<abbr title="Animals by-products">ABPs</abbr>) controls.</a></p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>entire animal bodies</li>
  <li>parts of animals</li>
  <li>products of animal origin</li>
  <li>other products obtained from animals that are not for human consumption. </li>
</ul>
<p>You must deal with <abbr title="Animals by-products">ABPs</abbr> promptly to protect people, animals and the environment. In most cases, this will mean arranging for them to be taken away to approved premises, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>rendering plants</li>
  <li>incinerators</li>
  <li>collection centres</li>
  <li>storage plants</li>
</ul>
<p>Your local council can provide a list of approved premises for the disposal of <abbr title="Animals by-products">ABPs</abbr>. </p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.nfsco.co.uk/" title="National Fallen Stock Scheme">National Fallen Stock Scheme</a> is a not-for-profit scheme which helps farmers and animal owners to follow the law on disposing of fallen stock. </p>
