<p>If you have navigated to this guide then it is more than likely that you have been posted to or are considering a posting to Cyprus. The aim of this guide is to provide you with as much information as possible to assist you in your move and preparation for it.</p>

<p>Life in Cyprus is very different from life back in the UK, or in Germany for that matter. While you will undoubtedly have ‘fun in the sun’, a tour here will be operationally focused for most people. There are important jobs to do, which will require commitment and dedication. We are quite a long way from home, some of the accommodation is pretty old and we can’t replicate all of the health and social welfare facilities available in the UK.</p>

<p>However, there are many compensations – great weather for most of the year, plenty of opportunities for sport, hobbies and adventurous training, and many interesting places in the region to visit. There is much for everyone, no matter what age or inclination.</p>

<p>Within this guide we have sought to provide you with a brief history of Cyprus, detailed information about the Sovereign Bases, housing, healthcare, schooling, etc. I trust that you will find it useful and that, should you be posted to Cyprus, you will have a fulfilling as well as enjoyable time.</p>

<h2 id="cyprus-a-quick-guide">Cyprus: a quick guide</h2>

<p>Even if you’ve been here before, there’s always a new world to discover. Cyprus lies at the crossroads of three continents, where East meets West and a new experience awaits for you under the sun every day. Where Championship Golf courses, inviting beaches, and breathtaking mountain trails lie around luxurious hotels. Enjoy the island’s beauty once more.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-cyprus">History of Cyprus</h3>

<p>Cyprus was the site of early Phoenician and Greek colonies. For centuries its rule passed through many hands. It fell to the Turks in 1571, and a large Turkish colony settled on the island. </p>

<p>In World War I, at the outbreak of hostilities with Turkey, Britain annexed the island. It was declared a Crown colony in 1925. The Greek population, which regarded Greece as its mother country, sought self-determination and union (enosis) with Greece. In 1955, a guerrilla war against British rule was launched by the National Organisation of Cypriot Combatants (<abbr title="National Organisation of Cypriot Combatants">EOKA</abbr>). In 1958, Greek Cypriot nationalist leader Archbishop Makarios began calling for Cypriot independence rather than union with Greece. During this period, Turkish Cypriots began demanding that the island be partitioned between the Greek and Turkish populations.</p>

<p>Cyprus became an independent nation on Aug. 16, 1960, after Greek and Turkish Cypriots agreed on a constitution, which excluded both the possibility of partition as well as of union with Greece. Makarios became the country’s first president.</p>

<p>Fighting between Greek and Turkish Cypriots flared up in the early 1960s, and a <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> peacekeeping force was sent to the island in 1965.</p>

<h2 id="movements">Movements</h2>

<h3 id="unaccompanied-baggage">Unaccompanied baggage</h3>

<p>As soon as possible after receiving your posting authority it is advisable to contact your Unit Quartermaster Department/PD Clerk regarding the shipment of your unaccompanied baggage, they will confirm your allowance and entitlements. </p>

<p>You will be required to complete F/Mov/713A, prior to the collection of your unaccompanied baggage and you will be required to complete a customs form to enable you to import your personal goods into Cyprus. Do not be alarmed by this form and its completion. You should only list major electrical goods and furniture you will be sending eg fridge freezer, three-piece suite, microwave etc. Bearing in mind that your cubic capacity will limit what you can bring. The excess charge per cubic metre over your limit is expensive.  </p>

<p>Household furniture and other articles, which you do not wish to bring, can be stored in the UK at public expense. A removal service does operate in Cyprus, however the capacity is greatly reduced compared to that for a move within Europe. Although you might have been advised that it takes 6 weeks from time of collection to time of delivery, previous experience has shown that eight weeks is a more sensible timescale. </p>

<p>Unlike Europe there is no requirement to give a quarter address in Cyprus prior to shipment. All unaccompanied baggage received at the Port Unit in Limassol will be stored until your arrival. Please refer to the Baggage Scales (Entitlements) at Annex F.</p>

<p>Ensure your Movements Clerk submits the appropriate F Mov Forms to DPRC London.<br>
Continuity post personnel (HQ UNFICYP only) have an alternative travel option (see below)</p>

<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>

<p>Complete an F/Mov/713 form and return it to your Unit Families Office.  </p>

<p>M&amp;S Shipping will contract a civilian storage firm to collect and store the remainder of your personal belongings and household contents.</p>

<h2 id="posting-to-cyprus">Posting to Cyprus</h2>

<h3 id="what-to-bring">What to bring</h3>

<h4 id="lots-of-summer-clothes">Lots of summer clothes</h4>
<p>In the heat of the summer you may find yourselves having to change a couple of times a day.  </p>

<h4 id="lots-of-swimwear">Lots of swimwear</h4>
<p>Because of the time spent in the swimming pool and in the sea, swimwear does take a battering and the sun does something to the elastic!</p>

<h4 id="duvet">Duvet</h4>
<p>Whether or not you have central heating you will be cold in the winter, especially at night.</p>

<h4 id="bbq">BBQ</h4>
<p>Invaluable, but can be bought on the island at reasonable prices.</p>

<h4 id="dishwasher">Dishwasher</h4>
<p>Unless you constantly wash up this is a good idea as it is not advisable to leave dishes, etc, in the sink or on the side - within minutes they are covered in ants. Check first if there is plumbing in your quarter.</p>

<h4 id="microwave">Microwave</h4>
<p>Self-explanatory.</p>

<h4 id="bicycles">Bicycles</h4>
<p>There are great opportunities for biking - both flat and mountainous terrain.</p>

<h4 id="tumble-dryer">Tumble dryer</h4>
<p>During the winter months there is a lot of moisture in the air and very few married quarters (<abbr title="Married quarters">MQs</abbr>) are centrally heated.</p>

<h4 id="washing-machine">Washing Machine</h4>
<p>Some booklets advise against bringing your own machine. Machines can be hired but over a 2 or 3 year period for a machine that regularly breaks down, rent can be costly.  Bringing your own will save you money and most makes can be serviced on the Island.</p>

<h4 id="fridge-freezer">Fridge Freezer</h4>
<p>As above.  All quarters are issued with an adequate fridge/freezer but bring your own if only to be used as a drinks fridge!</p>

<h4 id="tv-and-tv-stand">TV and TV stand</h4>
<p>Quarters are only provided with a coffee table to put your TV on.</p>

<h4 id="computer">Computer</h4>
<p>Cheap to subscribe to the Internet and by far the cheapest way to contact family and friends.</p>

<h4 id="flat-pack-computer-table">Flat pack computer table</h4>
<p>Can be expensive to buy here.</p>

<h4 id="lamps">Lamps</h4>
<p>Not provided in <abbr title="Married quarters">MQs</abbr>.</p>

<h4 id="ornamentspictures-etc">Ornaments/pictures, etc</h4>
<p>Make your <abbr title="Married quarters">MQ</abbr> a home.</p>

<h4 id="telephone">Telephone</h4>
<p>Not issued in quarters. Same connection as UK.</p>

<h4 id="winter-clothes">Winter clothes</h4>
<p>It does get very cold in winter and is often wet.</p>

<h4 id="skiing-clothes">Skiing clothes</h4>
<p>Needed in winter up at Troodos (normally plenty of snow for skiing).</p>

<h4 id="plugsextension-leads">Plugs/extension leads</h4>
<p>Same as UK.</p>

<h4 id="tupperware">Tupperware</h4>
<p>Sealed plastic containers are a must - however Tupperware or the like is very cheap in Cyprus.</p>

<h4 id="original-education-certificates">Original education certificates</h4>
<p>If you wish to gain employment then you will need to produce originals - photocopies are not accepted.</p>

<h4 id="qualification-certificates">Qualification certificates</h4>
<p>Originals - photocopies are not accepted.</p>

<h4 id="original-birthmarriage-certificates">Original birth/marriage certificates</h4>
<p>If you need to apply for a replacement passport or passport for children then you will need originals.</p>

<h4 id="cool-box">Cool box</h4>
<p>Ideal for the beach - but can be bought cheaply on the Island.</p>

<h4 id="garden-furniture">Garden furniture</h4>
<p>You will get lots of use out of it.  Plastic furniture can be bought cheaply in Cyprus. </p>

<h3 id="what-not-to-bring">What not to bring</h3>

<h4 id="toiletries-and-sun-creams">Toiletries and sun creams</h4>
<p>Readily available in Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (<abbr title="Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes">NAAFI</abbr>) and local pharmacies and supermarkets.</p>

<h3 id="nappies-and-wet-wipes">Nappies and wet wipes</h3>
<p>Good selection of popular brands as above.</p>

<h4 id="ironing-board">Ironing board</h4>
<p>Issued in <abbr title="Married quarters">MQ</abbr>.</p>

<h4 id="gardening-tools">Gardening tools</h4>
<p>Issued in <abbr title="Married quarters">MQ</abbr>.</p>

<h4 id="vacuum-cleaner">Vacuum cleaner</h4>
<p>Issued in <abbr title="Married quarters">MQ</abbr>.</p>

<h4 id="curtains">Curtains</h4>
<p>Issued in <abbr title="Married quarters">MQ</abbr>. Most <abbr title="Married quarters">MQs</abbr> have shutters or venetian blinds.</p>

<h4 id="lawnmower">Lawnmower</h4>
<p>We do have grass in the winter months which may need cutting. Household lawnmowers are not very good for this as the ground is often full of small stones. You can hire a gardener for about C£15 for 4 hours’ work.</p>

<h4 id="lampshades">Lampshades</h4>

<p>All <abbr title="Married quarters">MQs</abbr> have fitted glass light covers.</p>

<h4 id="tinned-food-and-dry-goods">Tinned food and dry goods</h4>
<p>All readily available - several large supermarkets on the Island. </p>

<p>There are always people leaving Cyprus who want to sell things before they move.</p>

<p>It is the individual’s responsibility to ensure that fully completed application forms are forwarded to the <abbr title="Civilian Pay and Personnel">CPP</abbr> team. Once received and checked, your application will be forwarded to the Line Manager of the Post for sift and short listing and if successful you will be invited for interview.</p>

<h3 id="core-competency-framework">Core Competency Framework</h3>

<p>Initial paper applications will be marked objectively against the core competences advertised within the job advert by the recruiting panel. Interviews for positions within BFC are conducted using a behavioural technique which will test you on your experiences and ask for examples of events. BFC uses core competences as a set of standards for entry and employment. Candidates should be able to demonstrate the requisite competencies for the grade. The link to the framework of core competencies is shown aside. </p>
