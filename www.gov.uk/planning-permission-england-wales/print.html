  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="when-you-need-it"><header><h1>Part 1: When you need it</h1>
  </header><p>You will probably need planning permission if you want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>build something new</li>
  <li>make a major change to your building - eg building an extension</li>
  <li>change the use of your building</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out if your project will need planning permission, contact your <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/wps/portal/genpub_LocalInformation?docRef=LocalInformation&amp;scope=202&amp;langid=0" title="Find your local planning authority">local planning authority (<abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr>).</a></p>

<h2>Applying for planning permission</h2>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/planningapplications" title="Apply for planning permission">apply for planning permission</a> online.</p>

<p>If your project needs planning permission and you do the work without getting it, you can be served an ‘enforcement notice’ ordering you to undo all the changes you have made. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>It’s illegal to ignore an enforcement notice, but you can <a href="/planning-permission-england-wales/appeals" title="Appealling a planning permission decision">appeal</a> against it.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="when-you-dont-need-it"><header><h1>Part 2: When you don't need it</h1>
  </header><p>Some building projects don’t need planning permission. This is known as <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/permission/responsibilities/planningpermission/permitted" title="Permitted development rights">‘permitted development rights’.</a></p>

<p>Building projects that normally have permitted development rights include:</p>

<ul>
<li>industrial premises and warehouses - though there are some <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/permission/commonprojects/warehouseindustrial/" title="Permitted development rights: limits and conditions">limits and conditions</a>
</li>
  <li>some outdoor signs and advertisements - though there are <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/permission/commonprojects/advertssigns/" title="Planning Portal (Adverts and signs)">special rules around these</a>
</li>
  <li>demolition - but before you begin you must get approval to demolish from <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/wps/portal/genpub_LocalInformation?docRef=LocalInformation&amp;scope=202&amp;langid=0" title="Find your local planning authority on the Planning Portal">your local planning authority</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other projects that might not need planning permission, eg projects that will have no impact on your neighbours or the environment. If you think this could apply to your project, check with <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/wps/portal/genpub_LocalInformation?docRef=LocalInformation&amp;scope=202&amp;langid=0" title="Find your local planning authority">your Local Planning Authority.</a></p>

<h2>Community Rights in England</h2>
<p>If your building project benefits the local community, and the community supports it, you may not have to go through the normal planning permission process. <a rel="external" href="http://communityrights.communities.gov.uk/what-are-community-rights/neighbourhood-planning/" title="Neighbourhood planning">Neighbourhood planning</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://communityrights.communities.gov.uk/what-are-community-rights/community-right-to-build/" title="Community Right to Build">Community Right to Build</a> allow your community to grant planning permission directly under certain circumstances. </p>

</article><article id="after-you-apply"><header><h1>Part 3: After you apply</h1>
  </header><p>Your local planning authority (<abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr>) will decide whether to grant planning permission for your project based on its development plan. It will not take into account whether local people want it.</p>

<p>To decide whether a planning application fits with its development plan, an <abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr> will look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number, size, layout, siting and external appearance of buildings</li>
  <li>the infrastructure available - eg roads and water supply</li>
  <li>any landscaping needs</li>
  <li>what you want to use the development for</li>
  <li>how your development would affect the surrounding area - eg if it would create lots more traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, planning applications are decided within 8 weeks. In England, for unusually large or complex applications the time limit is 13 weeks. If the decision takes longer, you can <a href="planning-permission-england-wales/appeals" title="Appeal a planning permission decision">appeal</a>.</p>


</article><article id="appeals"><header><h1>Part 4: Appeals</h1>
  </header><p>If your application is refused, try to come to an agreement with the local planning authority (<abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr>) by adjusting your plans.</p>

<p>If you can’t reach an agreement, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/appeals" title="Appeal a planning permission decision">appeal.</a></p>

<p>You must appeal within a <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/appeals/guidance/timelimits" title="Find out about time limits for planning permission appeals on the Planning Portal">time limit.</a></p>

<p>Appeals can take several months to be decided. </p>

<h2>What you can appeal against</h2>

<p>You can only appeal against a decision if the <abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>refuses your application</li>
  <li>grants permission but with conditions you object to</li>
  <li>refuses to change or remove a condition of planning permission that has been granted with conditions</li>
  <li>refuses to approve something reserved under an ‘outline permission’ – planning permission for a general idea, not of a specific plan</li>
  <li>refuses to approve something that you were told to build by your <abbr title="Local planning authority">LPA</abbr> as part of a previous planning permission (ie the previous planning permission was granted ‘with conditions’ and the current development was one of the conditions)</li>
  <li>does not make a decision on the application within the <a href="/planning-permission-england-wales/after-you-apply" title="Planning permission in England and Wales (After you apply)">deadline</a> and doesn’t get your written consent to change the deadline</li>
  <li>serves you with an <a href="/planning-permission-england-wales/when-you-need-it" title="Planning permission in England and Wales (When you need it)">enforcement notice</a> because it thinks you have broken planning permission and you don’t agree</li>
</ul>
