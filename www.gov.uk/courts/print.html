  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="magistrates-courts"><header><h1>Part 1: Magistrates' courts</h1>
  </header><p>All criminal cases start in a magistrates’ court.</p>

<p>Cases are heard by either:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 magistrates</li>
  <li>a district judge</li>
</ul>
<p>There isn’t a jury in a magistrates’ court.</p>

<h2>Cases a magistrates’ court deals with</h2>

<p>A magistrates’ court normally handles cases known as ‘summary offences’, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>most motoring offences</li>
  <li>minor criminal damage</li>
  <li>being drunk and disorderly</li>
</ul>
<p>It can also deal with some of the more serious offences, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>burglary</li>
  <li>drugs offences</li>
</ul>
<p>These are called ‘either way’ offences and can be heard either in a magistrates’ court or a Crown Court.</p>

<h2>Cases that magistrates pass to the Crown Court</h2>

<p>Magistrates’ courts always pass the most serious crimes to the Crown Court, eg: </p>

<ul>
<li>murder</li>
  <li>rape</li>
  <li>robbery</li>
</ul>
<p>These are known as ‘indictable offences’.</p>

<h2>Being kept in custody or granted bail</h2>

<p>In some cases, the magistrates court decides if you should be:</p>

<ul>
<li>kept in custody - eg a police or court cell</li>
  <li>granted ‘bail’, and let out on strict conditions - eg to keep away from named places or people</li>
</ul>
<p>This may happen if:</p>

<ul>
<li>another court hearing is needed</li>
  <li>the court needs more information before passing sentence</li>
  <li>your case is passed to the Crown Court for trial or sentencing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentences a magistrates’ court can give</h2>

<p>The court can give punishments including:</p>

<ul>
<li>up to 6 months in prison (or up to 12 months in total for more than one offence)</li>
  <li>a fine of up to £5,000</li>
  <li>a community sentence, like doing unpaid work in the community</li>
</ul>
<p>Courts can also give a combination of punishments - eg a fine and unpaid work in the community. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the court decides your sentence should be for longer than 6 months, it can pass your case to the Crown Court for sentencing.</p>
</div>

<h2>Appealing a sentence or conviction</h2>

<p>If you disagree with the magistrate court’s verdict, you may be able to <a href="/appeal-against-sentence-conviction/magistrates-court-verdict" title="Appeal against a magistrates' court verdict">appeal</a>.</p>

</article><article id="crown-court"><header><h1>Part 2: Crown Court</h1>
  </header><h2>Types of cases the Crown Court deals with</h2>

<p>A Crown Court deals with serious criminal cases, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>murder</li>
  <li>rape</li>
  <li>robbery</li>
</ul>
<p>It also deals with:</p>

<ul>
<li>appeals against a magistrates’ court conviction or sentence</li>
  <li>cases passed from a magistrates’ court for trial or sentencing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who does what in the court</h2>

<p>A Crown Court:</p>

<ul>
<li>normally has a jury - which decides if you’re guilty or not</li>
  <li>has a judge - who decides what sentence you get</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your solicitor (if you have one) can explain what happens in court - the judge and court staff will also give instructions about the trial.</p>
</div>

<h2>Sentences a Crown Court can give</h2>

<p>A Crown Court can give a range of sentences including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/community-sentences" title="Community sentences">community sentences</a></li>
  <li>
<a href="/types-of-prison-sentence" title="Types of prison sentences">prison sentences</a> - including life sentences</li>
</ul>
<h2>Appealing a sentence or conviction</h2>

<p>If you disagree with the Crown Court’s verdict, you may be able to <a href="/appeal-against-sentence-conviction/crown-court-verdict" title="Appeal against a Crown Court verdict">appeal</a>.</p>

</article><article id="youth-courts"><header><h1>Part 3: Youth courts</h1>
  </header><p>A youth court is a special type of magistrates’ court for people aged between 10 and 18.</p>

<p>A youth court has either:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 magistrates</li>
  <li>a district judge</li>
</ul>
<p>There isn’t a jury in a youth court.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must have a parent or guardian with you if you go to a youth court.</p>
</div>

<h2>How youth courts are different from adult courts</h2>

<p>Youth courts are less formal than adult courts, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>members of the public are not allowed in to the court (unless they get permission)</li>
  <li>you are called by your first name</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of cases a youth court deals with</h2>

<p>A youth court deals with cases like:</p>

<ul>
<li>theft and burglary</li>
  <li>anti-social behaviour</li>
  <li>drugs offences</li>
</ul>
<p>For serious crimes, like murder or rape, the case starts in the youth court but will be passed to a Crown Court.</p>

<h2>Sentences a youth court can give</h2>

<p>The court can give a <a href="/how-sentences-are-worked-out" title="How sentences are worked out">range of sentences</a> including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/community-sentences/community-sentences-if-you-are-under-18" title="Community sentences">community sentences</a></li>
  <li>
<a href="/types-of-prison-sentence/sentences-for-young-people" title="Types of prison sentence">Detention and Training Orders</a> carried out in secure centres for young people</li>
</ul>
<h2>Appealing a sentence</h2>

<p>If you disagree with the court’s verdict, you may be able to appeal. Court staff can give you information on how to appeal.</p>
