<h3 id="the-princess-marys-hospital">The Princess Mary’s Hospital</h3>

<p>The Princess Mary’s Hospital (<abbr title="The Princess Mary’s Hospital">TPMH</abbr>) is an independent Defence Medical Services unit within the bounds of RAF Akrotiri. It provides secondary medical care to all service personnel and UK-based civilians serving in Cyprus as well as their entitled dependants. Non-entitled patients are charged the appropriate rates in line with <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> guidelines.</p>

<p>The hospital is established for 25 beds, including a multi-disciplinary, mixed-sex ward, and a maternity unit. In addition to an outpatient department, <abbr title="The Princess Mary’s Hospital">TPMH</abbr> provides clinics in community mental health, physiotherapy and sexual health.</p>

<p>At the moment, <abbr title="The Princess Mary’s Hospital">TPMH</abbr> doesn’t provide an inpatient paediatric service, although it does have a resident paediatrician. Its paediatric nurses work out in the community in support of the medical centres. For admissions, <abbr title="The Princess Mary’s Hospital">TPMH</abbr> uses the paediatric facilities of the Cypriot Health Care System, which includes the specialist unit in Nicosia for paediatric patients who are less than 3 months old. (Patients up to the age of 14 years are normally referred to the consultant paediatrician <abbr title="The Princess Mary’s Hospital">TPMH</abbr> for admission under the Cypriot health care system.) </p>

<p>Adolescents, from the day of their 14th birthday and up to the day of their 16th birthday, require special consideration as to whether or not they should be admitted to either a paediatric or adult in-patient facility. A point to note is that the adolescent is respected as an individual, but before any decision is made, there may be several other factors to consider. When paediatric patients are admitted to a Cypriot health care facility, a visiting paediatric nurse and service hospital welfare staff provide a liaison service between the service and civilian practices.</p>

<p>Understandably, as it serves a small population, <abbr title="The Princess Mary’s Hospital">TPMH</abbr> can provide only a limited range of specialist care. However, while the breadth of services may be less than those of a UK NHS hospital, the care that we are in a position to provide is of a demonstrably high standard.  </p>

<h3 id="treatment-of-patients-with-existing-medical-conditions-on-posting-to-cyprus">Treatment of patients with existing medical conditions on posting to Cyprus</h3>

<p>It is in the patient’s best interest to ensure that the appropriate facilities are available in Cyprus to maintain continuity of treatment for their specific condition. If you, your partner or a dependant is diagnosed with a particular chronic illness or a rare condition that is being treated in the UK, it is very important that you and your partner or your dependant consults with your GP or Unit Medical Officer well in advance of arriving in Cyprus.</p>

<p>If necessary, the GP or unit medical officer can discuss individual cases with a single-service advisor or directly with the command medical advisor for British Forces Cyprus.</p>

<h3 id="treatment-of-non-entitled-patients">Treatment of ‘non-entitled’ patients</h3>

<p>An important point to remember about the medical and dental facilities is that there is no provision to provide free treatment for visitors to the British Forces/<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Civilian personnel serving in Cyprus. It is essential that all visitors prior to their arrival obtain adequate medical insurance cover. </p>

<p>With effect from 01 Jan 06, EU travellers should also apply for a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>), which should provide certain services within the Cypriot health care system. </p>

<h3 id="vacancies---nursing-uk-dependants">Vacancies - nursing: UK dependants</h3>

<p>Occasionally vacancies arise for nursing job opportunities for UK dependants within the hospital and all recruiting is carried out by the Civilian Labour Recruiting Office (<abbr title="Civilian Labour Recruiting Office">CLRO</abbr>) at RAF Aktrotiri. You will need to be registered with the <abbr title="Civilian Labour Recruiting Office">CLRO</abbr> for employment.</p>

<p>If you are a qualified nurse with a current Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) registration and may be interested in taking up employment with us, for further information please forward your details along with a CV to the Deputy Officer Commanding Nursing Wing (Dep OCNW).</p>

<h3 id="station-creche">Station creche</h3>

<p>Akrotiri Crèche is a popular, professionally run station amenity, catering for up to 120 children per week from the age of 3 months to 3 years. Registered with Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (<abbr title="Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association">SSAFA</abbr>) and a member of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, the crèche is run by a qualified co-ordinator, together with a team of qualified supervisors and play leaders. Open every weekday morning from 8am to 12 noon during school term times, it is a non-profit making, self-financing venture whose aim is to provide a stimulating and safe environment for children to develop to their full potential. </p>

<p>The crèche is limited by law to a maximum of 35 children at any one time: 10 in the baby room and 25 in the main room. Demand for places is very high and parents wishing to make use of the facility should register with the crèche co-ordinator as soon as possible after arrival on the station. Places are offered on a first-come, first-served basis in each of the 3 age ranges, initially for 1 session per week up to a maximum of 3; sessions are for either 2 or 4 hours.</p>

<p>The crèche provides a suitable range of activities and play equipment to stimulate children’s physical, intellectual, emotional and social needs, enabling them to grow in confidence and enhance their self-esteem. The children have companionship from adults and learn to socialize with children of their own age. But most important of all, Akrotiri Crèche is a happy place where the children can have fun. </p>

<h3 id="raf-akrotiri-primary-school">RAF Akrotiri Primary School</h3>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.school-portal.co.uk/Grouphomepage.asp?GroupId=723200" title="Akrotiri School website">Akrotiri School</a> is a 3 to 11 primary school located on the RAF base at Akrotiri. The school pupil population is usually round about 550 children from 3 to 11 years old (nursery to Y6), which makes it the biggest Service Children’s Education (<abbr title="Service Children’s Education">SCE</abbr>) school on the island, including the secondary schools. Our school is one of two primary schools in the Western Sovereign Base Area (<abbr title="Western Sovereign Base Area">WSBA</abbr>). Both schools feed St John’s Secondary School in Episkopi. Akrotiri School is part of <abbr title="Service Children’s Education">SCE</abbr>, a government agency within the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>, which administers schools for British servicemen and servicewomen, and civil servants throughout the world.</p>

<p>The school is currently staffed by 23 teachers including the Head, with the average class size approximately 26. It is well resourced with up to date furniture and equipment throughout and contains all the usual books found in any UK school. The school follows the English National Curriculum, and we strive to mirror all the best practices found in the UK. Inspection reports show that we do very well in this regard. </p>

<p>If you know that your child will be coming to Akrotiri Primary School, why not let us know the date of your arrival by contacting us on our <a rel="external" href="http://www.school-portal.co.uk/Grouphomepage.asp?GroupId=723200" title="Akrotiri School">school website</a>.  </p>

The school takes all secondary age children from families of service personnel and UK-based civilians serving in the Western Sovereign Base Area. Some expatriate Cypriot and children of other nationalities attend the school as fee-paying pupils. There are approximately 320 students on roll, although this number varies throughout the academic year.</p>

<h3 id="adult-education">Adult education</h3>

<p>RAF Akrotiri is unique in comparison to its UK counterparts as personnel are unable to link in directly with local colleges. As a result, a varied programme of extramural classes has been developed, in both academic and recreational subjects. Generally there are 2 major enrolment days, which take place during an academic year. The first is in September for the 30-week IGCSE courses and the first wave of short recreational courses. The second is in the following January, for the second wave of recreational courses. </p>

<h3 id="distance-and-web-based-learning">Distance and web-based learning</h3>

<p>Traditionally, distance learning has served as an invaluable alternative to service personnel who are subject to the turbulence of service life. Your motivation must be strong if you choose this method of study, because you will not normally benefit from interaction with other students and your contact with tutors can be limited. The method also suits certain types of learning much more than others. For example, if you need to improve your written communication skills, a well designed distance learning package is an effective way of achieving this.</p>

<p>Recent developments in technology, namely CD ROM and the internet, have vastly improved the scope of distance learning and you are no doubt aware that it is already an integral element of training in Trade Groups 1, 2 and 3. The internet serves as a means of delivering high quality learning materials which are enhanced by modern computer graphics. It also acts as an information service for research purposes and allows the student to communicate with classmates and tutors. Even if you are not normally enticed by computers, in future they may be a means to providing continuity when you are away from your permanent location for short periods of time. At the FDS Education Centre we have a high specification broadband IT suite equipped with a range of bespoke IT training packages.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The history of RAF Akrotiri began on 1st July 1955 when the first 30 personnel posted to the unit established themselves in the flat, dry, rocky scrubland on the windswept Akrotiri Peninsula. Nicosia Airport was temporarily closed as a result of terrorist activity and the handling of the Island’s civil aviation was diverted to Akrotiri - with a tented civil airport reception centre to match. An RAF Regiment Light Anti-Aircraft Wing was also brought in. </p>

<p>By the end of August 1956 station strength had reached 260 officers and 2864 other ranks, a massive increase in 12 months. It brought with it 1430 personnel on the daily sick-parade, mainly a result of the over-crowding and insanitary conditions, as construction lagged behind the unforeseen demand for accommodation. </p>

<p>From its rough beginnings with caravans and mud tracks, the station was laid out, roads made, hangars and some permanent buildings constructed. 3 new barrack blocks were opened allowing another 32 families onto the station into formerly misappropriated married quarters. Other intended married quarters were still in use as billets, station sick quarters, an education centre, a hospital and a NAAFI shop. A bank had opened for business, and 4 wooden shacks served as shops. A small theatre club was in existence and out along Ladies’ Mile, the Sailing Club had been formed. </p>

<p>In its first 12 months as a functioning operational airfield, RAF Akrotiri had not only survived but had expanded and flourished. Although continuously affected by the EOKA troubles in one way or another and with more than a quarter of the year spent on a full war footing for the Suez Crisis, morale was high and the pioneer spirit was still strong.</p>
