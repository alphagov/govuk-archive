  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If someone owes you money and won’t pay, you can take court action against them. This is known as making a court claim.</p>

<p>You usually have to pay a court fee, and you may not win your case or get your money back.</p>

<p>A <a rel="external" href="http://www.civilmediation.justice.gov.uk/" title="mediation service">mediation service</a> could be quicker and cheaper than going to court.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Mediation is when an impartial person helps two sides work out an agreement.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to take court action</h2>

<p>If you still want to take court action you can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>use <a href="/make-money-claim-online/" title="Money Claim Online">Money Claim Online</a>
</li>
  <li>download a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=338" title="claim form">claim form</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have to go to a court hearing if the other person or business denies owing the money.</p>

<p>If they admit owing the money or don’t respond, you can get the court to order them to pay.</p>

<p>If they still won’t pay, you’ll need to ask the court to take extra steps to collect the money - eg using bailiffs. This is called enforcing a judgment.</p>

<h2>Where to send the claim form</h2>

<p>Send the claim form to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>
 County Court Money Claims Centre  
PO Box 527  
<br>Salford  
<br>M5 0BY 
</p></div></div>

<p>You’ll need to include payment for the court fee.</p>

</article><article id="court-fees"><header><h1>Part 2: Court fees</h1>
  </header><p>The court fee is based on the amount you’re claiming, plus interest.</p>

<p>Using Money Claim Online will be cheaper than sending a claim form to the County Court Money Claims Centre.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">

</div>

</article><article id="work-out-interest"><header><h1>Part 3: Work out interest</h1>
  </header><p>You can claim interest on the money you’re owed.</p>

<p>If you’re owed money by another business, you can charge <a rel="external" href="https://private-frontend.production.alphagov.co.uk/late-commercial-payments-interest-debt-recovery-costs/charging-interest-commercial-debt?edition=1" title="interest on late commercial payment">interest on a late commercial payment</a>.</p>

<p>For other types of debt, the rate is usually 8%.</p>

<p>To calculate this, use the steps below.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Work out the yearly interest:</strong> take the amount you’re claiming and multiply it by 0.08 (ie 8%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Work out the daily interest:</strong> divide your yearly interest from step 1 by 365 (the number of days in a year).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Work out the total amount of interest:</strong> multiply the daily interest from step 2 by the number of days the debt has been overdue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>If you were owed £1,000:</p>

<ul>
<li>the annual interest would be £80 (1000 x 0.08 = 80)</li>
  <li>you’d divide £80 by 365 to get the daily interest: about 22p a day (80 / 365 = 0.22)</li>
  <li>after 50 days this would be £11 (50 x 0.22 = 11)</li>
</ul>
</div>


</article><article id="after-you-make-your-claim"><header><h1>Part 4: After you make your claim</h1>
  </header><p>The person or business who owes you money must respond to your claim within 14 days of receiving it.</p>

<h2>What to do if you get paid</h2>

<p>If they pay you, or make you an offer you’re happy with:</p>

<ul>
<li>tell them you’re withdrawing your claim</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/Search.do?court_id=1459" title="contact the court centre">contact the court centre</a> to let it know you’re ending the case</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you don’t get a response</h2>

<p>If they don’t respond to your claim, ask the court to order them to pay.</p>

<p>To do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>use <a rel="external" href="http://www.moneyclaim.gov.uk/web/mcol/welcome/" title="Money Claim Online">Money Claim Online,</a> (if you started your claim online) or</li>
  <li>fill in a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=465" title="request for judgment form">request for judgment form</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to take your claim to court</h2>

<p>You may have to go to a court hearing if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the person or business says they don’t owe you any money</li>
  <li>they disagree with the amount</li>
  <li>you can’t agree on how the money will be repaid</li>
</ul>
<p>The court will send you a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=384" title="questionnaire">questionnaire,</a> asking for more information on the case. Fill this in and return it to the court.</p>

<p>You will have to pay extra <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetLeaflet.do?court_leaflets_id=264" title="court fees">court fees.</a></p>

<h2>Agreeing without going court</h2>

<p>You can still talk to the other person or business, and try to reach an agreement before the court hearing.</p>

<p>Use the court’s small claims mediation service if your claim is worth under £5,000 - contact your <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/" title="local county court">local county court.</a></p>

<p>If you settle out of court before the hearing, you may be able to get some of your court fees refunded.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The judge might not award you costs if they think you’ve made no effort to agree out of court.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="going-to-court"><header><h1>Part 5: Going to court</h1>
  </header><p>You may have to go to court if the other person or business denies owing the money, and they defend the case.</p>

<h2>Small claims</h2>

<p>If your case is a small claim - under £5,000 - it may be dealt with using written evidence, without a hearing.</p>

<p>If there is a hearing, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>represent yourself</li>
  <li>pay for a solicitor to represent you</li>
  <li>ask someone to speak on your behalf, like your partner or an advice worker - you must get the court’s permission</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Small claims hearings can be held in the judge’s room or a court-room at the defendant’s local county court.</p>
</div>

<h2>Cases worth more than £5,000</h2>

<p>If you’re claiming for more than £5,000, there may be a more formal hearing, and you should get legal advice.</p>

<h2>After the hearing</h2>

<p>The court will send you a letter giving you its decision.</p>

<p>If you disagree with the decision, you have 21 days from the date of the decision to appeal. The letter will explain how to do this.</p>

</article><article id="enforce-a-judgment"><header><h1>Part 6: Enforce a judgment</h1>
  </header><p>If you win your case, you may have to ask the court to take steps to collect the payment.</p>

<p>You will have to pay extra court fees - ordering someone to attend court costs £50, and the other steps cost £100 each.</p>

<h2>Find out what the person or business can afford to pay</h2>

<p>It’s worth working out what the person or business can afford to pay.</p>

<p>You can ask the court to <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=547" title="order someone to attend court">order a debtor to attend court</a> to provide evidence of their income or spending, like bills and statements.</p>

<p>If the money is owed by a business, you can ask for an <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.bl.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=551" title="officer from the company">officer from the company</a> to attend court, to give details of its accounts.</p>

<p>You can then decide on what you need to do to get your money.</p>

<h2>Send bailiffs to collect payment</h2>

<p>You can ask the court to use bailiffs to collect the money.</p>

<p>To do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>fill in a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=555" title="warrant of execution form">warrant of execution form,</a> or</li>
  <li>use <a rel="external" href="http://www.moneyclaim.gov.uk/web/mcol/welcome/" title="Money Claim Online">Money Claim Online</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The bailiff will ask for payment within 7 days. </p>

<p>If the debt isn’t paid, the bailiff will visit the person’s home or business, to see if anything could be sold to pay the debt.</p>

<h2>Get money deducted from wages</h2>

<p>You can ask the court to send an order to the person’s employer, to take money from wages to pay the debt.</p>

<p>To do this, fill in an <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=567" title="attachment of earnings order">attachment of earnings order.</a></p>

<h2>Freeze assets or money in an account</h2>

<p>The court can freeze money in the person’s bank or building society account (or in a business account).</p>

<p>To do this, fill in a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=573" title="third party debt order">third party debt order.</a></p>

<p>The court will decide if money from the account can be used to pay the debt.</p>

<h2>Charge the person’s land or property</h2>

<p>You can ask the court to charge the person’s or company’s land or property.</p>

<p>To do this, fill in a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=576" title="charging order">charging order.</a></p>

<p>If the land or property is sold, they must pay this charge before they get their money.</p>
