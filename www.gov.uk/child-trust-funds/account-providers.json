Tell the CTF Helpline when you contact them that your child gets DLA.\r\n\r\n$C\r\n**CTF Helpline**  \r\n**Telephone:** 0845 302 1470  \r\n(+44 1355 359 002 from outside the UK)  \r\n**Textphone:** 0845 366 7870\r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\n##If your child dies\r\n\r\nThe money in the account will be paid to the person who inherits the child's estate. This is often one of the child\u2019s parents, but if your child was married, it could be their husband or wife.\r\n\r\nIf you weren't able to open the account before your child died, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) will still pay you what your child was entitled to. \r\n\r\nIf you get Child Benefit for a child who has died this can still carry on for a short time. It may also help with any extra costs you face at this time.\r\n\r\n###What you need to do\r\n\r\nYou need to do the following:\r\n\r\n- if the account has already been opened - tell the account provider\r\n- if you haven't opened an account yet - tell the CTF Helpline\r\n- if you get Child Benefit for the child who has died - call the Child Benefit Helpline:\r\n\r\n$C\r\n**Child Benefit Helpline**  \r\n**Telephone:** 0845 302 1444  \r\n(+44 161 210 3086 from outside the UK)  \r\n**Textphone:** 0845 302 1474   \r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\n\r\nThe account provider will usually need proof, like the death certificate.\r\n\r\n*[CTF]:Child Trust Fund\r\n*[DLA]:Disability Living Allowance\r\n*[HMRC]:HM Revenue & Customs","slug":"if-your-child-is-terminally-ill-or-dies","title":"If your child is terminally ill or dies"}}],"type":"guide"}
