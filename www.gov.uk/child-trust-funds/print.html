  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>A Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) is a long-term tax-free savings account for children. All children eligible for a <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> account should now have one.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Your child is entitled if all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>they were born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011</li>
  <li>you were paid <a href="/child-benefit" title="Child Benefit">Child Benefit</a> for them for at least one day before 4 January 2011</li>
  <li>your child lives in the UK</li>
  <li>they aren’t subject to any immigration restriction </li>
</ul>
<h3>If your child is looked after by a local council</h3>

<p>They got a <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> account if both the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>they were looked after by a local council before 3 April 2011</li>
  <li>they meet the other qualifying conditions above (excluding child benefit)</li>
</ul>
<h3>If you work overseas and get a European family benefit</h3>

<p>Your child got a <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> account if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>they were born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011</li>
  <li>your child lives in the UK</li>
  <li>you were paid a family benefit by another European Union country for at least one day before 4 January 2011</li>
  <li>you work in that same country</li>
</ul>
<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>You can add up to £3,600 a year to the account. The money belongs to the child but can’t be taken out until they’re 18.</p>

<p>You could get extra money paid directly into the account - if you’re on a low income, for example.</p>

<p>There’s no tax to pay on the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> income or any profits it makes. It won’t affect any benefits or tax credits you receive.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If your child isn’t eligible for a <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> account, you may be able to open a <a href="/junior-individual-savings-accounts/overview" title="Junior Individual Savings Accounts (ISA)">Junior ISA</a> instead.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="child-trust-fund-vouchers"><header><h1>Part 2: Child Trust Fund vouchers</h1>
  </header><p>Vouchers worth £250 or £50, depending on when your child became entitled, were issued to Child Benefit claimants to open an account.</p>

<p>The voucher was sent to the person who gets Child Benefit (or the European family benefit). </p>

<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) opened an account for your child if one of the following applied:</p>

<ul>
<li>the voucher wasn’t used</li>
  <li>a local council started to look after your child before you claimed Child Benefit</li>
</ul></article><article id="extra-payments"><header><h1>Part 3: Extra payments</h1>
  </header><p>Your child could get extra payments in some circumstances.</p>

<h2>If you’re on a low income</h2>

<p>Your child could get an extra payment of £250 or £50 on top of the starting payment. The amount you get will be the same as on your Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) voucher.</p>

<p>To get one of these payments both of the following must apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you qualify for <a href="/child-tax-credit" title="Child Tax Credit">Child Tax Credit</a>
</li>
  <li>you are on a ‘low income’</li>
</ul>
<p>‘Low income’ means your total household income before tax was:</p>

<ul>
<li>£16,190 or less between 6 April 2010 and 5 April 2011</li>
  <li>£16,040 or less between 6 April 2009 and 5 April 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) will pay these extra payments directly into your child’s account after you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>renewed your <a href="/renewing-your-tax-credits-claim" title="tax credits">tax credits</a> (usually between April and July)</li>
  <li>been sent your final tax credits award notice</li>
</ul>
<p>Your child could also qualify for the extra <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> payment if you get any of the following for your child:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/income-support" title="Income Support">Income Support</a></li>
  <li>income-based <a href="/jobseekers-allowance" title="Jobseeker's Allowance">Jobseeker’s Allowance</a>
</li>
  <li><a href="/pension-credit" title="Pension Credit">Pension Credit</a></li>
  <li><a href="/employment-support-allowance" title="Employment and Support Allowance">Employment and Support Allowance</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>If a local council looks after your child</h2>

<p>If the local council started looking after your child before Child Benefit was claimed, the normal starting payment is doubled:</p>

<ul>
<li>£500 - paid if your child was born between 1 September 2002 and 1 August 2010</li>
  <li>£100 - paid if your child was born between 2 August 2010 and 2 January 2011</li>
</ul>
<p>If the local council started to look after your child after Child Benefit was claimed, your child won’t be entitled to any extra money. They will just get the normal starting payment.</p>

<h2>Backdated claims</h2>

<p>Children who turned 7 between 1 September 2009 and 31 July 2010 or qualified for <a href="/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit" title="Disability Living Allowance">Disability Living Allowance (DLA)</a> between 6 April 2009 and 5 April 2011 may be able to claim backdated payments.</p>


</article><article id="account-types"><header><h1>Part 4: Account types</h1>
  </header><p>There are 3 main types of Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) account. </p>

<h2>Stakeholder accounts</h2>

<p>These have to follow government rules, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>investing the money in a number of companies, not just one</li>
  <li>moving the money to lower-risk investments when your child is 13</li>
</ul>
<p>This helps protect your child’s money. All <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> providers offer stakeholder accounts.</p>

<h2>Share accounts</h2>

<p>These invest your child’s money by buying shares in companies. The value can go up or down.</p>

<h2>Savings accounts</h2>

<p>These work in the same way as a bank or building society account. Money invested is secure and earns interest.</p>

</article><article id="managing-the-account"><header><h1>Part 6: Managing the account</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re the main contact for the Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) account you’re called the ‘registered contact’ and have certain responsibilities until the child is 16 and can manage their own account.</p>

<h2>Your responsibilities as the registered contact</h2>

<p>You’re the only person who can:</p>

<ul>
<li>tell the account provider how to invest the fund and run the account</li>
  <li>move the account to another provider</li>
  <li>change the type of account</li>
</ul>
<h2>Paperwork you need to keep</h2>

<p>Keep the following paperwork:</p>

<ul>
<li>your child’s Unique Reference Number - this is shown on the voucher </li>
  <li>the statements for the account</li>
  <li>details of the type of account and the provider</li>
</ul>
<p>This will make it easier if you need to query anything or make any changes to the account.</p>

<h2>Changing accounts or providers</h2>

<p>Check if the current provider offers the type of account you want to change to. If they don’t, you may need to try another provider.</p>

<p>To change provider, you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>choose a new provider</li>
  <li>contact the new provider to check what forms you need to fill in</li>
</ul>
<p>The new provider will get in touch with your existing account provider to arrange for the money to be moved. They will also tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) about the change.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>From April 2013, new providers will no longer tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> about account changes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Changing a registered contact</h2>

<p>You can change the registered contact if your family circumstances have changed.</p>

<p>Follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Get an application form from the provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both you - and the person who wants to be the new registered contact - sign the form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return the form to the provider.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Only someone with parental responsibility for the child can be the registered contact, like a parent, step-parent or legal guardian.</p>

<p>If you split up from someone who is the registered contact and want to take this role on instead, both of you will need to agree to this.</p>

<h2>When your child is 16 or 18</h2>

<p>When your child is 16 they can take over the account and manage it. When they’re 18, they can take the money out.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A child can still choose to let their registered contact manage the account when they turn 16.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="adding-money-to-the-account"><header><h1>Part 7: Adding money to the account</h1>
  </header><p>Anyone can pay money into a Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) account.</p>

<h2>How much you can add</h2>

<p>You can put £3,600 a year into the account - the start date for the year is the child’s birthday and the end date is the day before their next birthday. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the £3,600 limit isn’t used in a year, you can’t carry any unused amount forward to the following year to make up the difference.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to pay money in</h2>

<p>For stakeholder accounts you can add money by:</p>

<ul>
<li>cheque</li>
  <li>standing order</li>
  <li>direct debit</li>
</ul>
<p>For savings or share accounts, check with your provider.</p>

<h2>Government payments</h2>

<p>Payments made by the government don’t count towards the £3,600, apart from:</p>

<ul>
<li>payments made by the Welsh government up to 31 January 2011</li>
  <li>payments made by a local council to a child they are looking after</li>
</ul>
<h2>The year you open the account</h2>

<p>There are different rules for the first year. The start date is the day the account is opened but the end date is still the day before the child’s next birthday. </p>


</article><article id="if-your-child-is-terminally-ill-or-dies"><header><h1>Part 8: If your child is terminally ill or dies</h1>
  </header><p>You can take money out of your child’s Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) account if they are terminally ill. If your child has died, the money passes to whoever inherits the child’s estate (their property and possessions). </p>

<h2>If your child is terminally ill</h2>

<p>‘Terminally ill’ means that they have a disease or illness that is going to get worse and are likely to die within 6 months. Only the registered contact can take money out.</p>

<h3>How to take money out</h3>

<p>Contact the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> Helpline to let them know that:</p>

<ul>
<li>your child is terminally ill</li>
  <li>you want to take the money out of the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> account </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll need to provide evidence that your child is terminally ill.</p>
</div>

<p>If your child is already getting <a href="/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit" title="Disability Living Allowance (DLA)">Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</a> because of their illness, tell the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> Helpline when you contact them.</p>

<p>If your child doesn’t get <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> office will send you a form for your doctor to complete and return to them.</p>

<h2>If your child dies</h2>

<p>The money in the account will be paid to the person who inherits the child’s estate. This is often one of the child’s parents, but if your child was married, it could be their husband or wife.</p>

<p>If you weren’t able to open the account before your child died, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) will still pay you what your child was entitled to. </p>

<p>If you get <a href="/changes-affect-child-benefit" title="Child benefit if a child dies">Child Benefit</a> for a child who has died this can still carry on for a short time. It may also help with any extra costs you face at this time.</p>

<h3>What you need to do</h3>

<p>Tell the account provider. They’ll usually need proof, like the death certificate.</p>
