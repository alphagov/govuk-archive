</header><article id="when-you-can-apply"><header><h1>Part 1: When you can apply</h1>
  </header><h2>Children under 16 years old</h2>

<p>You can usually apply for a passport for your child if: </p>

<ul>
<li>they’re under 16 </li>
  <li>you legally have ‘parental responsibility’ for them</li>
</ul>
<p>You automatically have parental responsibility if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>are the child’s mother</li>
  <li>are the child’s father and are married to the child’s mother</li>
  <li>were married to the child’s mother when the child was born (or, in Scotland, when the mother became pregnant)</li>
  <li>have adopted the child (alone, or jointly)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If your situation is more complex, you can get more information about <a href="/parental-rights-responsibilities" title="Parental rights and responsibilities">parental responsibility</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Cost</h2>

<p>It costs £46 to get a child passport by post, or £54.75 using the Post Office <a href="/how-the-post-office-check-and-send-service-works" title="How the Post Office Passport Check &amp; Send service works">Passport Check &amp; Send service</a>. </p>

<h2>Children nearly or over 16 years old</h2>

<p>If your child will be 16 within the next few weeks or is over 16, they must apply for a 10-year adult passport. They can apply without getting parental consent.</p>

<h2>If your child was adopted in the UK</h2>

<p>Your child can get a British passport if either adoptive parent is British and was usually living in the UK (‘habitually resident’) when the child was adopted. </p>

<p>You must send your child’s adoption certificate showing the British parent’s details.</p>

<h3>Adopted before 1 June 2003</h3>

<p>Your child doesn’t automatically qualify for a British passport - even if one of the parents is a British citizen. </p>

<p>Depending on the country the adoption took place in, the adoption may be recognised for parental responsibility purposes, but not for nationality purposes. Contact the Passport Adviceline for help before you apply.</p>

<h3>Adopted on or after 1 June 2003</h3>

<p>Your child can get a British passport if either parent is British and the British parent was usually living (‘habitually resident’) in the UK when the child was adopted. </p>

<p>Only adoptions conducted under the Hague Convention are recognised. You must send the child’s full Hague Convention adoption certificate showing the parents’ details.</p>

<p>You must also send evidence of the British parent’s nationality status, eg a British passport issued before the date of adoption (you can just provide the passport number at section 4 of the application form).</p>
