<h2>How Incapacity Benefit is paid</h2>

<p>All benefits, pensions and allowances are paid into an account, eg your bank account.</p>

<h2>Pension income rules</h2>

<p>If you have a gross pension income of more than £85 a week, the amount of benefit will be reduced by half of the excess. The excess is the difference between £85 and your actual pension income.</p>

<p>For example, for a pension income of £100, the excess is £15. The amount of Incapacity Benefit payable is reduced by half of that, which is £7.50.</p>

<h2>Exceptions to the pension income rules</h2>

<p>The pension incomes rules do not apply if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you were getting Incapacity Benefit before 6 April 2001</li>
  <li>your claim was made before 6 April 2001</li>
  <li>you get the highest rate of the care component of <a href="/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit" title="Disability Living Allowance">Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</a>
</li>
</ul></article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>

<p>You may have been able to get Incapacity Benefit before 31 January 2011 if you couldn’t work because of illness or disability.</p>

  </header><h2>Review of your Incapacity Benefit claim</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Incapacity Benefit is being phased out. Jobcentre Plus will review your Incapacity Benefit claim to check if you’re capable of work or can get <a href="/employment-support-allowance" title="Employment and Support Allowance">Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</a> instead.</p>
</div>

<p>Your benefit claim will not be reviewed if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re already getting <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you are due to reach State Pension age before 6 April 2014</li>
</ul>
<h2>How your claim will be reviewed</h2>

<p>Jobcentre Plus will write to you when your benefit claim is going to be reviewed. Not everyone will be contacted at the same time. This process started in October 2010 and is expected to be completed in 2014.</p>

<h3>Questionnaire</h3>

<p>Jobcentre Plus will send you a questionnaire to complete. This questionnaire will ask about how your long term health condition or disability affects your ability to complete everyday tasks.</p>

<p>You must complete this questionnaire with as much detail as possible and return it by the date requested. If you don’t, your benefit claim may be affected.</p>

<p>Include with your questionnaire any medical reports or letters you have which you feel will help to explain your long term health condition or disability. Send the originals - they will be returned to you. If you can’t send the originals, send photo-copies.</p>

<h3>Work Capability Assessment</h3>

<p>The information you give will be used to decide if you need to attend a face-to-face assessment. This is called a Work Capability Assessment. It will help find out:</p>

<ul>
<li>what you’re able to do</li>
  <li>whether you might be capable of work</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you’re asked to attend an assessment, you must go and take part fully. If you don’t, your benefit claim may be affected.</p>
</div>

<h2>If the review finds that you’re capable of working</h2>

<p>If this happens, Jobcentre Plus will call you. They will discuss what benefits you might be able to claim, eg Jobseeker’s Allowance. They will also write to you.</p>

<h2>If the review finds you’re entitled to <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you’re entitled to <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, Jobcentre Plus will call you to let you know. They will also write to you.</p>

<p>Your Incapacity Benefit claim will be transferred automatically to <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>. There will be no break in the payments you get.</p>

<p>Depending on how severe your disability or health condition is, you will be placed in one of two groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work Related Activity Group</li>
  <li>Support Group</li>
</ul>
<h3>Work Related Activity Group</h3>

<p>If you’re placed in the Work Related Activity Group, you will get support to help you prepare for suitable work.</p>

<p>Your benefit may be affected if you don’t take part in the work-related support.</p>

<h3>Support Group</h3>

<p>If you are severely disabled or have the most severe health conditions you will be placed in the Support Group. You will not be expected to look for work and will get the extra support you need.</p>

<p>You will not have to take up any work-related support unless you want to.</p>

<h2>If your circumstances change</h2>

<p>Tell <a rel="external" href="http://los.direct.gov.uk/default.aspx?type=2&amp;lang=en" title="contact Jobcentre Plus">Jobcentre Plus</a> if your circumstances change. Some examples of the changes you need to report include:</p>

<ul>
<li>doing any work, including voluntary work</li>
  <li>starting training and getting a training allowance</li>
  <li>changing your address</li>
  <li>going abroad</li>
  <li>going into hospital (your Incapacity Benefit won’t usually be affected)</li>
