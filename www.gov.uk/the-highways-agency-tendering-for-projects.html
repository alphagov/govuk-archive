<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you want to tender for a Highways Agency contract then the Highways Agency may assess your organisation and its capabilities against various criteria before allowing you to tender. They do not have an approved list of suppliers - prequalification criteria are specific to each contract. In addition you may need to hold certain accreditations and certificates. The Highways Agency uses Constructionline to assess your business’ financial status and capabilities.</p>

<p>This guide explains the types of goods and services that the Highways Agency buys, how their supplier selection process works, and which tools they use to assess your organisation. It also tells you where to find details of tendering opportunities for forthcoming contracts, which accreditations and certificates you might need, and how to obtain them.</p>

<h2 id="tendering-for-highways-agency-contracts">Tendering for Highways Agency contracts</h2>

<p>There are several different types of Highways Agency contracts that you can tender for, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Early Contractor Involvement contracts</li>
  <li>design and build contracts</li>
  <li>Managing Agent Contractor contracts</li>
  <li>individual (discrete) contracts</li>
  <li>private-finance contracts</li>
  <li>frameworks contracts</li>
</ul>
<p>Highways Agency contracts can be for one or more of the following types of work:</p>

<ul>
<li>design</li>
  <li>construction</li>
  <li>maintenance</li>
  <li>consultancy</li>
  <li>supply</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are awarded a consultancy contract, there are various restrictions on what related contracts you can apply for. </p>

<h3 id="pre-qualification-process">Pre-qualification process</h3>

<p>Before you can be invited to tender for a Highways Agency contract, you may need to complete a pre-qualification process. </p>

<h3 id="capability-assessment-toolkit-cat">Capability Assessment Toolkit (<abbr title="Capability Assessment Toolkit">CAT</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Part of the pre-qualification process operated by the Highways Agency for certain high-value contracts uses scoring based on CAT3. </p>

<h3 id="national-highways-sector-scheme-accreditation-and-health-and-safety-certification">National Highways Sector Scheme accreditation and health and safety certification</h3>

<p>The various accreditations and certifications include, but are not necessarily limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>National Highways Sector Scheme accreditation - this is usually required for managing agent and larger contracts. </li>
  <li>health and safety assessment certification - this is usually required for managing agent contracts and large contracts. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="finding-contracts">Finding contracts</h3>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://highways.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.shtml">find details of forthcoming tendering opportunities on the Highways Agency eTendering System website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/13036.aspx">find details of current and forthcoming Highways Agency contracts on the Highways Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/">browse planned, current and completed road projects by region on the Highways Agency website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="performance-measurement">Performance measurement</h3>

<p>If your tender is successful, then the Highways Agency will measure various aspects of how well you perform on this contract.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-highways-agency-contracts">Types of Highways Agency contracts</h2>

<p>You can tender for several different types of Highways Agency contracts.</p>

<h3 id="early-contractor-involvement-eci-contracts">Early Contractor Involvement (<abbr title="Early Contractor Involvement">ECI</abbr>) contracts</h3>

<p>This form of contract allows supplier engagement at an early stage of a project, in order to draw in industry experience at the design and preparation stages. <abbr title="Early Contractor Involvement">ECI</abbr> contracts remain an option for major highways schemes where there is significant scope for input from the supply chain. Suppliers’ engagement will be on a partnering basis. Their knowledge and abilities to influence project decisions will have maximum impact in terms of project timing, quality and cost.</p>

<h3 id="design-and-build-db-contracts">Design and build (<abbr title="Design and build">D&amp;B</abbr>) contracts</h3>

<p><abbr title="Design and build">D&amp;B</abbr> contracts are used for substantial projects beyond the threshold of Highways Agency frameworks (see below), where the <abbr title="Early Contractor Involvement">ECI</abbr> approach is not suitable. Typically, these are larger renewal schemes, or schemes where most design decisions are fixed in advance. Suppliers are expected to complete the required level of design, which must include introducing any potential savings in time, cost and/or quality gained through their previous know-how.</p>

<h3 id="managing-agent-contractor-mac-contracts">Managing Agent Contractor (<abbr title="Managing Agent Contractor">MAC</abbr>) contracts</h3>

<p><abbr title="Managing Agent Contractors">MACs</abbr> and <abbr title="Technology Managing Agent Contractors">TechMACs</abbr> (Technology Managing Agent Contractors) are the Highways Agency’s main contracts for maintaining, operating and improving their network. Contracts are typically five years in length with options to extend by up to two years depending on performance. Annual spending on each contract runs to tens of millions of pounds. They are based around robust and consistent contractual quality process models. Performance measurement and management, linked to continual improvement and incentives, are key contract principles. Suppliers are expected to ensure transparency through all tiers of their supply chain, and to operate as an integrated team with the Highways Agency to support best delivery.</p>

<h3 id="individual-discrete-contracts">Individual (discrete) contracts</h3>

<p>These are used to procure requirements beyond the scope of frameworks, <abbr title="Managing Agent Contractors">MACs</abbr> and <abbr title="Technology Managing Agent Contractors">TechMACs</abbr>, or those which are are specific to a particular requirement. The Highways Agency promotes these projects on the basis of risk/value, with a commercial focus on delivering optimum value. Suppliers are expected to complete the level of individual analysis and design called for by the project.</p>

<h3 id="private-finance-contracts">Private-finance contracts</h3>

<p>Private-finance contract forms are considered for high value, strategic projects, in accordance with government policy. For roads under Design Build Finance and Operate contract forms, the deliverables are centred on the provision of an operating service rather than an asset. Over an extended contract, the private sector assumes responsibility for the operation and maintenance of a length of existing or new road, and can include building specified improvement schemes. Suppliers are expected to partner the Highways Agency in design, construction and operation and form a strategic part of delivering the Highways Agency’s aims to their customers.</p>

<h3 id="frameworks-contracts">Frameworks contracts</h3>

<p>These contracts are used to procure particular works, goods or services required over a period of time across government. They are generally used where there are either known repeat requirements in developed, competitive markets, or there are variable demands and requirements that are best managed under a flexible arrangement. The Highways Agency will continue to both initiate their own frameworks and utilise frameworks put in place by other areas of government, eg the Department for Transport and Buying Solutions. The Highways Agency will continue to incorporate potential collaboration opportunities into their frameworks, eg with local authorities.</p>

<h2 id="the-pre-qualification-and-selection-process-for-highways-agency-contracts">The pre-qualification and selection process for Highways Agency contracts</h2>

<p>If you are a potential supplier, you will need to go through a pre-qualification process before being invited to tender for Highways Agency contracts. This applies to those who wish to contract directly with the Highways Agency - either individually or as part of a joint venture or partnership.</p>

<p>The Highways Agency does not have an approved list of suppliers - pre-qualification criteria are specific to each contract. The Highways Agency uses Constructionline to assess a business’ financial status and capabilities. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.constructionline.co.uk/">find guidance about pre-qualification for Highways Agency contracts on the Constructionline website</a>.</p>

<p>When you research forthcoming tender and contract opportunities on the Highways Agency website, the contract notice will show which pre-qualification processes will apply and how you can obtain the pre-qualification pack (<abbr title="pre-qualification pack">PQP</abbr>) if one is being used. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/18907.aspx">view <abbr title="pre-qualification pack">PQP</abbr> example documents on the Highways Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>The range and detail of information requested will vary depending on many factors, eg the size, length, value and complexity of the contract. When applying for a particular contract you will be informed exactly what the Highways Agency needs to know about your business.</p>

<p>There are two main stages to pre-qualification.</p>

<p>Stage 1 gives the Highways Agency assurance that your organisation meets the requirements of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 and of the contract itself in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>health and safety processes</li>
  <li>technical ability and/or professional ability</li>
  <li>economic, financial and legal standing</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppliers who pass stage 1 go on to the next stage - short-listing. If you don’t meet all the first stage requirements, you will be informed at this stage and will not be considered for short-listing.</p>

<p>Stage 2 scores supplier submissions to aid the short-listing process. A combination of past performance, capability and any ‘added value’ that a business may bring to the contract is used to calculate a vendor rating. Suppliers are then ranked according to their vendor rating.</p>

<h3 id="how-a-supplier-is-selected-for-award-of-a-contract">How a supplier is selected for award of a contract</h3>

<p>The Highways Agency assessment of tenders is carried out in three stages:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the first stage, the content of the quality tender submission is judged by a panel</li>
  <li>the second stage involves the verification of the quality submission and financial information</li>
  <li>the final stage involves the validation of the prices and confirmation of the availability of key people</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact requirements of each contract are set out in the tender documents provided by the Highways Agency, and you will be given the opportunity for debriefing at the end of the tender selection process.</p>

<h2 id="the-highways-agency-capability-assessment-toolkit">The Highways Agency Capability Assessment Toolkit</h2>

<p>The Highways Agency uses the <abbr title="Capability Assessment Toolkit">CAT</abbr> in the pre-qualification process for certain high-value contracts. These tend to be larger value, major projects such as Managing Agents Contracts or Technology Maintenance Contracts. The <abbr title="Capability Assessment Toolkit">CAT</abbr> assessment helps both the Highways Agency and service supply companies by:</p>

<ul>
<li>identifying business strengths and areas for development that are essential to perform a wide range of work</li>
  <li>ensuring companies know what is required to complete Highways Agency contracts</li>
</ul>
<p>Contract notices state when the <abbr title="Capability Assessment Toolkit">CAT</abbr> process will be applied and how to apply for a contract without an existing assessment and <abbr title="Capability Assessment Toolkit">CAT</abbr> score. Many suppliers for larger contracts have already been through the process and received a <abbr title="Capability Assessment Toolkit">CAT</abbr> score. The <abbr title="Capability Assessment Toolkit">CAT</abbr> process is regularly reviewed and suppliers will be reassessed periodically.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120810121037/http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/19091.aspx">find information on the <abbr title="Capability Assessment Toolkit">CAT</abbr> on the National Archives website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="national-highways-sector-scheme-approval">National Highways Sector Scheme approval</h2>

<p>If you win a Highways Agency contract, and work is specified in accordance with the Specification for Highway Works (<abbr title="Specification for Highway Works">SHW</abbr>), you will need to register with a National Highways Sector Scheme (<abbr title="National Highways Sector Scheme">NHSS</abbr>) for specific areas of work. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.standardsforhighways.co.uk/mchw/vol1/index.htm">find details of the <abbr title="Specification for Highway Works">SHW</abbr> on the Standards for Highways website</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Highways Sector Scheme">NHSS</abbr> is a partnership between industry, highway authorities, certification industry, training/competency bodies and others such as the Health &amp; Safety Executive. <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSSs</abbr> are management schemes that focus on quality as an objective and, among other things, specify the minimum qualifications and training that you need for particular roles.</p>

<p>Registration and skills cards for operatives working on the Highways Agency network are issued by the <abbr title="National Highways Sector Scheme">NHSS</abbr> and the Construction Skills Certification Scheme. For information about skills cards and staff registration requirements, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/the-highways-agency-skills-card-and-registration-requirements-for-suppliers">skills card and registration requirements for suppliers of the Highways Agency</a>.</p>

<h3 id="accreditation-to-an-nhss">Accreditation to an <abbr title="National Highways Sector Scheme">NHSS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>To achieve accreditation to an <abbr title="National Highways Sector Scheme">NHSS</abbr>, you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>download the current Sector Scheme Document for the industry you require approval from - <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukas.com/Technical-Information/Publications-and-Tech-Articles/Publications/PubsForCBAccred.asp">find a <abbr title="National Highways Sector Scheme">NHSS</abbr> list on the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>) website</a>
</li>
  <li>contact the approved certification body to arrange an audit</li>
</ul>
<p>After a successful audit, your organisation will receive an approved certificate of scope. This will allow you to operate the scheme on Highways Agency roads or any contracts requiring sector scheme approval.</p>

<h2 id="health-and-safety-assessments">Health and safety assessments</h2>

<p>When you apply for a Highways Agency contract, the Highways Agency will assess health and safety information as part of their pre-qualification process.</p>

<h3 id="highways-agency-health-and-safety-assessment-certificate">Highways Agency Health and Safety Assessment Certificate</h3>

<p>If your business will tender for contracts frequently, it’s sensible to have a valid Highways Agency Health and Safety Assessment Certificate. Otherwise you’ll have to provide evidence of your policies and records and complete the health and safety questionnaire every time you tender. Sometimes you will need to hold this certificate before you can be invited to tender for a contract. Even if the certificate is not a mandatory requirement, having one will satisfy the health and safety requirements for any contract.</p>

<h3 id="annual-assessments">Annual assessments</h3>

<p>Before you can receive a certificate, the Highways Agency will assess the effectiveness of the integration of your safety management system into your organisation. The assessment is carried out annually. <a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/19095.aspx">Find out how to obtain a Highways Agency Health and Safety Assessment Certificate on the Highways Agency website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="performance-measurement-1">Performance measurement</h2>

<p>For the Highways Agency to achieve continuous improvement, they need to measure the performance of all of their contracts. To do this, the Highways Agency uses a performance measurement toolkit - Motivating Success Toolkit (<abbr title="Motivating Success Toolkit">MST</abbr>) - which gives guidance on the measurement and management of performance on major projects. The scores created by this toolkit are then used to assist with future supplier selection.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Motivating Success Toolkit">MST</abbr> is used to:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide a continually improving service to Highways Agency customers</li>
  <li>ensure best value is delivered within all contracts and projects</li>
  <li>support measurement of suppliers</li>
  <li>realise the benefits of long-term relationships with suppliers</li>
  <li>drive continuous improvement through benchmarking</li>
  <li>identify and communicate best practice and areas for improvement</li>
  <li>assist suppliers to understand their performance relative to Highways Agency expectation and relative to their competitors and the wider industry</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/15098.aspx">view the <abbr title="Motivating Success Toolkit">MST</abbr> on the Highways Agency website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="consultancy-contract-restrictions">Consultancy contract restrictions</h2>

<p>When tendering for Highways Agency contracts, the following restrictions apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>a supplier engaged in collecting data for a proposed contract is excluded from tendering for that contract, except when providing information on a current maintenance contract</li>
  <li>a supplier assisting with the compilation of contract documents, or in any part of the tender assessment process, is excluded from tendering for that contract</li>
  <li>a supplier with exclusive access to material that would give them an unfair advantage in tendering for other contracts is excluded from tendering for any contract</li>
  <li>a supplier not tendering for a contract, but who assists in any way with the tender assessment process, will operate under the control of the procurement officer and is not permitted access to sensitive information from any tender submission</li>
  <li>direct employees or associates from a tendering supplier, engaged on short-term assignments, are excluded from work which requires judgement to be exercised in cases that could potentially be of advantage to their employer</li>
</ul>
