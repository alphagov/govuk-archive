The notice is normally either at least 4 weeks or 2 months, depending on the type of tenancy you have.\r\n\r\nHowever, they can start eviction proceedings immediately if you\u2019re responsible for:\r\n\r\n+ serious anti-social behaviour \u2013 like drug-dealing \r\n+ domestic violence \r\n\r\nFor most types of tenancy, your council or housing association must also tell you why they're planning to evict you.\r\n\r\nThe quicker you reply to the written notice, the better chance you have of keeping you home. If you ignore it and stay in the property, or the council or housing association isn't satisfied with your response, they may apply to the court for permission to evict you.\r\n\r\n##Rent arrears\r\nIf you're facing eviction over unpaid rent, before taking you to court the council or housing association must:\r\n\r\n+ try to talk to you about the arrears as early as possible\r\n+ give you detailed information about the arrears\r\n+ offer help, if you need it, to make a housing benefit claim\r\n+ agree to delay taking you to court if you make a reasonable offer to pay off your rent arrears\r\n\r\nThese steps are known as the [\u2018pre-action protocol\u2019.](http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/courts-and-tribunals/courts/procedure-rules/civil/contents/protocols/prot_rent.htm \"Ministry of Justice: Pre-action protocol for rent arrears\"){:rel=\"external\"} \r\n","slug":"written-notice","title":"Written notice"}},{"table":{"body":"Your council or housing association will need permission from a court to evict you.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll get papers confirming the date of the hearing.
