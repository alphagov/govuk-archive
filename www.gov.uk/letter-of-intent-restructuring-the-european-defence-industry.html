<p>The Letter of Intent (<abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr>) Framework Agreement Treaty was established to create the necessary measures to facilitate the restructuring of the European defence industry. It was signed on 27 July 2000 by the Defence Ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK.</p>

<p>The Framework Agreement aimed to create the political and legal framework necessary to facilitate industrial restructuring in order to promote a more competitive and robust European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (<abbr title="European Defence Technological and Industrial Base">EDTIB</abbr>) in the global defence market.</p>

<p>In order to meet this aspiration the Framework Agreement established a strategic level Executive Committee (<abbr title="Executive Committee">ExCo</abbr>). Each nation takes it in turn to Chair the <abbr title="Executive Committee">ExCo</abbr> on an annual basis and the United Kingdom provided the chairmanship to 30 June 2011, when France took over. The <abbr title="Executive Committee">ExCo</abbr> meets 2 or 3 times a year to review progress on current activities and agree new priorities and activities. It is also responsible for providing regular reports to Ministers and State Secretaries.</p>

<p>The Framework Agreement is an inter-governmental treaty and is not a European Union institution. It does not have an office, secretariat or budget and relies on the Parties to agree and deliver the work programmes. It was one of the first examples of closer European co-operation in the armaments field.</p>

<p>The political, industrial and military landscape has changed significantly since the <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> Framework Agreement was signed. Since then, in 2004, the European Defence Agency (<abbr title="European Defence Agency">EDA</abbr>) was established. The European Commission has taken an ever closer interest in defence industrial and market issues, and the defence industrial base has become increasingly globalised.</p>

<p>In the context of these strategic level changes, the 6 biggest defence industrial nations of Europe have agreed overwhelmingly to adapt the <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> Framework Agreement so that the Nations can better meet the challenges of the new strategic framework they now co-operate under and to rethink their role as an effective group, which is able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>monitor and influence the European Commission in the development and drafting of new European market regulations</li>
  <li>share information with the <abbr title="European Defence Agency">EDA</abbr> on ongoing <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> activities</li>
  <li>provide advice and guidance to <abbr title="European Defence Agency">EDA</abbr> on key industrial, market, <abbr title="Research &amp; Technology">R&amp;T</abbr>, test and evaluation capabilities, and military requirements </li>
  <li>contribute to future <abbr title="European Defence Agency">EDA</abbr> developments that support the strengthening of military capabilities</li>
  <li>continue to develop and establish a more effective and informal dialogue with <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> defence industries</li>
  <li>establish contact with other EU member states and where relevant, with other third parties such as the United States (US) with the aim of promoting greater transparency and mutual understanding of <abbr title="European Defence Technological and Industrial Base">EDTIB</abbr> and transatlantic defence industrial and market issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Six specialist sub-committees were established under the Framework Agreement to facilitate the restructuring of the defence industrial base.</p>

<h2 id="sub-committee-1-security-of-supply">Sub-committee 1: security of supply</h2>

<p>The aim of SC 1 is to contribute to achieving security of supply for the <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> nations and maintenance of strategically important assets, activities and skills, in the framework of European defence industrial restructuring and the creation of Transnational Defence Companies (<abbr title="Transnational Defence Company">TDC</abbr>).</p>

<p>SC 1 focuses on:</p>

<ul>
<li>establishing procedures for consultation among the nations in case of the formation of a <abbr title="Transnational Defence Company">TDC</abbr> or significant change of defence companies on which another <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> nation relies for its supplies</li>
  <li>facilitating the opening of defence equipment markets</li>
  <li>developing a system to facilitate the prioritisation, allocation, acceleration or expansion of production of defence articles to meet the requirements of the <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> nations</li>
</ul>
<p>The Parties have signed an Implementing Arrangement on Security of Supply and are currently developing a Code of Practice on defence industry restructuring which establishes procedures for industries to inform governments in advance of any industrial restructuring process located in their territories that implies the abandonment, transfer or relocation of part or whole of key strategic activities. Industry representatives from all 6 nations will be invited to subscribe to this Code on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>SC 1 is also developing a code of conduct on prioritisation of defence supplies with associated contractual principles with the aim of setting out at national level the relations between defence industry and governments. The contractual principles are to be an annex to the code of conduct.</p>

<p>This code of conduct establishes the voluntary acceptance by industry of a set of principles to ensure the security of supply of defence equipments and services to the <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> nations in cases of emergency, crisis or armed conflict.</p>

<p>The code of conduct aims to allow the public entity, ‘the Authority’, in a situation of emergency, armed conflict or crisis, to request industry to accelerate or expand the production of defence articles or services. In this situation, the parties will try and agree additional costs and fair and reasonable commercial solutions.</p>

<p>SC 1 members have also established senior national security of supply representatives and provided advice and guidance to the European Defence Agency on security of supply matters. </p>

<h2 id="sub-committee-2-export-procedures">Sub-committee 2: export procedures</h2>

<p>The objectives of SC 2 are:</p>

<ul>
<li>to simplify transfers of defence articles and defence services between <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> nations</li>
  <li>to increase cooperation in exports</li>
  <li>to ensure that the exports of equipment produced in cooperation will be responsibly managed in accordance with each participating State’s international obligations and commitments in the export control area, especially the criteria of the European Union Code of Conduct.</li>
</ul>
<p>SC 2 focuses on:</p>

<ul>
<li>simplifying transfers (and related administrative procedures) between the 6 <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> nations</li>
  <li>converging defence exports policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The parties have signed an Implementing Arrangement on Export Procedures. </p>

<p>As directed by the Framework Agreement, SC 2 established the Global Project Licences (GPLs) to facilitate the transfer of the components, sub-systems and systems required for cooperative armament programmes.</p>

<p>The Implementing Arrangement also establishes simplified procedures for:</p>

<ul>
<li>applying for a <abbr title="Global Project Licence">GPL</abbr>
</li>
  <li>consultations between <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> nations related to GPLs application</li>
  <li>establishing the permitted export destinations lists, requested by industry involved in the Cooperation Armament Programme (<abbr title="Cooperation Armament Programme">CAP</abbr>) for defence articles and related defence services produced and developed under a <abbr title="Cooperation Armament Programme">CAP</abbr> covered by a <abbr title="Global Project Licence">GPL</abbr>
</li>
  <li>consultations between <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> nations related to the permitted export destinations requested by industry</li>
</ul>
<p>SC 2 has drafted a declaration on the facilitation of the transit of military goods from one <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> country to another through the territory of third parties, which has been agreed by <abbr title="Executive Committee">ExCo</abbr> and which the parties are committed to implement.</p>

<p>Concerning future actions, SC 2 has identified (in cooperation with industrial representatives) 2 subject areas. The first one concerns global licences covering internal exchanges of a transnational defence company. The second one is the creation of an open general licence, based on the British experience, allowing transfers within <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> countries of less sensitive military equipments not resulting from cooperative armament programmes.</p>

<p>SC 2 has played a leading role in the drafting of the European Directive on intra-community transfers, which establishes the concept of a European global licence.</p>

<h2 id="sub-committee-3-security-of-information">Sub-committee 3: security of information</h2>

<p>The objective of SC 3 is to adapt procedures relating to security clearances, transmission of classified information and visits, to facilitate industrial cooperation without undermining the security of classified information and material.</p>

<p>SC 3 focuses on:</p>

<ul>
<li>reviewing the effectiveness of the provisions regarding personal and facility security clearances and access to classified information, and reduction of the time requested to grant those clearances and access</li>
  <li>facilitating transfer of classified information</li>
  <li>harmonising security regulations between Member States.</li>
</ul>
<p>SC 3 has developed procedural guidelines covering:</p>

<ul>
<li>guidelines for including security provisions in MoUs for international programmes</li>
  <li>procedures to allow nationals of non-<abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> nations access to classified information including a consultation form;</li>
  <li>standardised forms for Facility Security Clearance and Request for Visit procedures</li>
  <li>procedures and standardised forms for hand carriages of classified information by company couriers</li>
  <li>procedures for and a list of mutually accepted commercial encryption devices for electronic transmission of restricted information</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Executive Committee">ExCo</abbr> approved the updating of the Security Annex of the Framework Agreement in order to take into account the changes related to:</p>

<ul>
<li>National Security Classifications, including the identification of the French ‘Diffusion Restreinte’ as a protective marking and not security classification</li>
  <li>the commercial courier procedure to limit the requirement of the guarantee that the consignment will be delivered to the consignee within a 24-hour-period under regular circumstances</li>
  <li>duration for maintenance of visitor’s records, deciding that such records will have to be retained, according to national laws and regulations and in any case for a period no less than two years, instead of five years</li>
</ul>
<p>SC 3 is finalising 2 documents: Specific Operating Instruction for Secure Communications (SOISC) and EDIR/FA Minimum Communication Security Standard. Both documents are not legally binding but may be used as guidelines or templates. They complement respective national policies pertinent to the control, protection, and electronic transmission of classified information and could be applied to industry participants of a project.</p>

<p>SC 3 presented to the NATO AC35 Ad-hoc Working Group (AHWG) a proposal to include in the NATO security regulations the <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> procedures on international visits, for adoption on a case by case basis, in NATO programmes where <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> nations are involved.</p>

<p>SC 3 has maintained their close relationships with the industry of the 6 <abbr title="Letter of Intent">LoI</abbr> countries and associated them to the future works. SC 3 has also worked closely with the European Commission, which is looking to strengthen the security of information and simplify existing rules and regulations.</p>

<h2 id="group-of-research-directors">Group of Research Directors</h2>

<p>After the signature of the Implementing Arrangement in 2003, Sub-committee 4 was disbanded and the Group of Research Directors (<abbr title="Group of Research Directors">GRD</abbr>) was established with the aim of achieving the objectives of the Framework Agreement as defined in the research and technology field.</p>

<p>The mission of the <abbr title="Group of Research Directors">GRD</abbr> is:</p>

<ul>
<li>to foster coordination of joint research activities to increase the advanced knowledge base and thus encourage technological development and innovation</li>
  <li>exchanging information on defence-related <abbr title="Research &amp; Technology">R&amp;T</abbr> programmes, strategies and policies</li>
  <li>develop a common understanding of what technologies are needed with the objective of establishing a coordinated approach to fulfil those needs</li>
  <li>analyse the information exchanged to make best use of resources</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of a review of national activities a number of technologies were identified as priorities for all the nations and open for collaboration. Four <abbr title="Research &amp; Technology">R&amp;T</abbr> cooperative teams have started formulating a common view on more efficient use of resources and identification of collaborative projects in the areas of: </p>

<ul>
<li>electrical fuel cells </li>
  <li>robotics and automated vehicles </li>
  <li>IR-sensors</li>
  <li>information and data fusion techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of additional areas are being assessed as candidates for further investigation by the <abbr title="Research &amp; Technology">R&amp;T</abbr> cooperative teams. The areas are: </p>

<ul>
<li>synthetic environments </li>
  <li>architectures </li>
  <li>digital signal processing techniques</li>
  <li>electric propulsion</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition a disruptive technology working group was set up. This will focus on investigating how emerging technologies or combinations of single technologies can lead to new concepts or performance improvements on existing equipments. <abbr title="Group of Research Directors">GRD</abbr> was also instrumental in establishing the security of information clauses enshrined within the EUROPA Research and Technology Memorandum of Understanding, which has simplified arrangements for those nations cooperating with each other under the <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr>.</p>
