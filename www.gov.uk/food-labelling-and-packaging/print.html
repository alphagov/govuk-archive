  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>To sell food and drink products, the label must be:</p>

<ul>
<li>clear and easy to read</li>
  <li>permanent</li>
  <li>easy to understand</li>
  <li>easily visible</li>
  <li>not misleading</li>
</ul>
<p>You must show <a href="/food-labelling-and-packaging/food-labelling-what-you-must-show" title="Basic food labelling requirements">certain basic information</a> and list the <a href="/food-labelling-and-packaging/ingredients-list" title="Food and drink ingredient lists">ingredients</a>. You might also have to show <a href="/food-labelling-and-packaging/food-and-drink-warnings" title="Food warnings">certain warnings.</a></p>

<p>There are special <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/enforcement/sectorrules/winestandards/lawguide" title="A guide to wine law">rules for labelling wine.</a></p>

<h2>Products sold loose or in catering businesses</h2>
<p>If you run a catering business, you sell food loose or package it for sale in your shop, you only need to show:</p>

<ul>
<li>the name of the food</li>
  <li>if any of the ingredients have been irradiated, or have come from genetically modified sources</li>
  <li>certain <a href="/food-labelling-and-packaging/food-and-drink-warnings" title="Food warnings">warnings</a>
</li>
  <li>any food additive you have added</li>
  <li>from December 2014, <a href="/food-labelling-and-packaging/ingredients-list" title="Food ingredient and allergen labelling">allergen information</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You must show more information if you sell meat products loose. </p>

<h2>Packaging</h2>
<p>If you package food yourself, you must use packaging that’s suitable for food use. Suitable packaging is marked ‘for food contact’ or has a symbol on it that that looks like a wine glass and a fork.</p>

<p>There are special rules for using plastics, ceramics or cellophane for packaging. You must have written evidence that you’ve kept to them.</p>

<p>This is known as a ‘declaration of compliance’ and you can get it from your packaging supplier. You also have to get one if you buy food that’s already packaged for sale in any of those materials.</p>

</div>

<h2>Food assurance schemes</h2>

<p>You could also join voluntary food assurance schemes such as <a rel="external" href="http://www.redtractor.org.uk/Home" title="Find out more about Red Tractor">Red Tractor</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.lioneggs.co.uk/page/lionmark" title="Find out more about Lion Eggs">Lion Eggs.</a> These schemes let customers known food has been produced to certain standards eg on food safety or animal welfare.</p>

<h2>Medical claims</h2>

</article><article id="organic-food"><header><h1>Part 6: Organic food</h1>

<p>Once registered you’ll have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>follow a strict set of guideslines laid down by national and international law</li>
  <li>keep thorough and accurate records of production processes</li>
  <li>allow annual and random inspections</li>
