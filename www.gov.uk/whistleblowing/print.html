</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Whistleblowing is when a worker reports suspected wrongdoing at work. Officially this is called ‘making a disclosure in the public interest’.</p>

<p>A worker can report things that aren’t right, are illegal or if anyone at work is neglecting their duties, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>someone’s health and safety is in danger</li>
  <li>damage to the environment</li>
  <li>a criminal offence</li>
  <li>the company isn’t obeying the law (like not having the right insurance)</li>
  <li>covering up wrongdoing</li>
</ul></article><article id="how-to-blow-the-whistle"><header><h1>Part 2: How to 'blow the whistle'</h1>
  </header><p>The way a worker can ‘blow the whistle’ on wrongdoing depends on whether they feel they can tell their employer. </p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The worker should check their employment contract or ask human resources/personnel if their company has a whistleblowing procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they feel they can, they should contact their employer about the issue they want to report</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they can’t tell their employer, they should contact a ‘prescribed person or body’.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>A worker can only tell the prescribed person or body if they think their employer:</p>

<ul>
<li>will cover it up</li>
  <li>would treat them unfairly if they complained</li>
  <li>hasn’t sorted it out and they’ve already told them</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Laura knows the director of her bank is stealing clients’ money - she reports it to the Financial Services Authority, not her employer.</p>

</article><article id="dismissals-and-whistleblowing"><header><h1>Part 3: Dismissals and whistleblowing</h1>
  </header><p>A worker can’t be dismissed because of whistleblowing. If they are, they can claim unfair dismissal – they’ll be protected by law as long as certain criteria are met.</p>

<h2>Types of whistleblowing eligible for protection</h2>

<p>These are called ‘qualifying disclosures’. They include when someone reports:</p>

<ul>
<li>that someone’s health and safety is in danger</li>
  <li>damage to the environment</li>
  <li>a criminal offence</li>
  <li>that the company isn’t obeying the law (like not having the right insurance)</li>
  <li>that someone’s covering up wrongdoing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who’s protected</h2>

<p>The following people are protected:</p>

<ul>
<li>employees</li>
  <li>agency workers</li>
  <li>people that are training with an employer, but not employed</li>
  <li>self-employed workers, if supervised or working off-site</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A worker will be eligible for protection if they honestly think what they’re reporting is true and they think they’re telling the right person.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who’s not protected</h2>

<p>Workers aren’t protected from dismissal if:</p>

<ul>
<li>they break the law when they report something (eg they signed the Official Secrets Act)</li>
  <li>they found out about the wrongdoing when someone wanted legal advice (‘legal professional privilege’) - eg if they’re a solicitor</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Workers who aren’t employees can’t claim unfair dismissal because of whistleblowing, but they’re protected and can claim ‘detrimental treatment’.</p>
</div>

<h2>Tribunals</h2>

<p>If a worker is dismissed for whistleblowing, they can go to an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment Tribunals">Employment Tribunal</a> or an industrial tribunal in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>If the tribunal decides the employee has been unfairly dismissed, it will order that they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>reinstated (get their job back)</li>
  <li>paid compensation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Whistleblowing abroad</h2>

<p>Workers are protected from unfair treatment even they blow the whistle on something that happened abroad. This includes when a different country’s law has been or will be broken.</p>
