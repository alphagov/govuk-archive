<p>How much reduction you get depends on your circumstances - eg your income, if you have children.  </p>

<p>You can get other types of help to pay your Council Tax if:  </p>

<ul>
<li>you live with another adult (who isn’t your partner) - known as the <a href="/council-tax-benefit/eligibility" title="Second Adult Rebate">Second Adult Rebate</a>
</li>
  <li>your <a href="/council-tax-benefit/further-information" title="Extended Payment of Council Tax Benefit">benefits have stopped</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can apply for Council Tax Benefit whether you own your home, rent, are unemployed or working.</p>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>Council Tax Benefit is a reduction (money off) your Council Tax bill. </p>

<p>The most Council Tax Benefit you can get is a 100% reduction. How much get depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>where you live</li>
  <li>your household income - this includes things like savings (over £6,000), pension, your partner’s income</li>
  <li>if your children live with you </li>
  <li>if other adults live with you</li>
</ul>
<p>Your council will send you a bill showing how much your reduction is and what you have to pay.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/benefits-adviser" title="Benefits adviser">benefits adviser</a> to see what your reduction could be or contact your <a href="/apply-council-tax-benefit" title="Apply for Council Tax Benefit">local council</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Second Adult Rebate</h2>

<p>Instead of Council Tax Benefit you may qualify for a Second Adult Rebate. </p>

<p>This is a Council Tax Bill reduction based on the circumstances of another adult in your home. </p>
