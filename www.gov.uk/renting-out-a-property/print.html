  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="landlord-responsibilities"><header><h1>Part 1: Landlord responsibilities</h1>
  </header><p>If you rent out your property, you’re a landlord. This means you have responsibilities, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping your rented properties safe and free from health hazards</li>
  <li>making sure all <a rel="external" href="http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/renting_a_property/for_landlords.aspx" title="Gas Safe Register - advice for landlords">gas</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/electricity/maintenance/safety.htm" title="Electrical equipment safety requirements from the Health and Safety Executive">electrical equipment</a> you supply is safely installed and maintained</li>
  <li>following fire safety regulations - <a rel="external" href="http://www.lacors.gov.uk/lacors/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?id=19844" title="Download 'Housing: Fire safety' (PDF, 1.6MB)">download ‘Housing: Fire safety’ (PDF, 1.6MB)</a>
</li>
  <li>providing an <a href="/buy-sell-your-home/energy-performance-certificates" title="Energy Performance Certificates">Energy Performance Certificate</a> for the property</li>
  <li>
<a href="/deposit-protection-schemes-and-landlords" title="Deposit protection schemes and landlords">protecting your tenant’s deposit</a> in a government-approved scheme</li>
</ul>
<h2>Health and safety inspections</h2>
<p>The Housing Health and Safety Rating System (<abbr title="Housing Health and Safety Rating System">HHSRS</abbr>) is used by your local council to make sure that properties in its area are safe for the people who live there. This involves inspecting your property for possible hazards - for example, uneven stairs leading to increased risk of falls.</p>

<p>If you own a property and rent it out, the council may decide to do an <abbr title="Housing Health and Safety Rating System">HHSRS</abbr> inspection because:</p>

<ul>
<li>your tenants have asked for one</li>
  <li>it has done a survey of local properties and thinks your property might be hazardous</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<abbr title="Housing Health and Safety Rating System">HHSRS</abbr> hazard ratings</h3>

<p>Inspectors look at 29 health and safety areas and score each hazard they find as category 1 or 2, according to its seriousness.</p>

<p>You must take action to fix category 1 faults - the most serious hazards - if your council serves an enforcement notice. In certain circumstances, the council can do the works themselves and claim the costs back from you. You may also be asked to remove the less serious category 2 hazards.</p>

<h2>Financial responsibilities</h2>

<p>You will have to pay Income Tax on your rental income, minus your day-to-day running expenses.</p>

<p>If you have a mortgage on the property you want to rent out, you must get permission from your mortgage lender.</p>


</article><article id="making-repairs"><header><h1>Part 2: Making repairs</h1>
  </header><p>You must keep your property in good condition, and any gas or electrical systems must meet specified safety standards.</p>

<h2>When you can enter the property</h2>
<p>You have a legal right to enter your property to inspect it or carry out repairs. You must give your tenants at least 24 hours’ notice, although immediate access may be possible in emergencies. Your tenants have the right to stay in the property during the repairs.</p>

<p>You’re normally responsible for repairs to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the structure of your property</li>
  <li>basins, sinks, baths and other sanitary fittings</li>
  <li>heating and hot water systems</li>
  <li>any damage you cause through attempting repairs</li>
</ul>
<p>If your property is seriously damaged by a fire, flood or other similar incident, you don’t have to rebuild or renovate it. However, if you do, you can’t charge your tenants for any repairs made.</p>

<h2>Common areas</h2>

<p>If you own a block of flats, you will usually be responsible for repairing common areas, like staircases. Councils can ask landlords to fix problems in common areas, or to repair a tenant’s flat that has been damaged by another tenant.</p>

<h2>What happens if repairs aren’t done properly</h2>

<p>If you refuse to carry out repairs, tenants can:</p>

<ul>
<li>start a claim in the small claims court for repairs under £5,000</li>
  <li>in some circumstances, carry out the repairs themselves and deduct the cost from their rent</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t make repairs to remove hazards, your tenants can ask the local council to inspect the property under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System and to take any action that is necessary.</p>

<p>If the council finds serious hazards, it must take enforcement action to make sure the hazard is removed.</p>

<h2>If the property is temporarily unfit to live in</h2>

<p>You can ask tenants to move out during major repairs. Before this happens, you should agree in writing:</p>

<ul>
<li>how long the works will last</li>
  <li>the tenants’ right to return</li>
  <li>details of any alternative accommodation</li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t repossess a property to do repairs. However, if you’re planning substantial works, or want to redevelop the property, you can apply to the courts for an order for your tenants to leave. The courts are more likely to grant this if you provide alternative accommodation.</p>

<h2>Repairs and charging rent</h2>
<p>If the repairs are very disruptive, your tenants may be able to claim a reduction on their rent known as a ‘rent abatement’. This will depend on how much of the property is unusable. </p>

<p>You may have the right to <a href="/renting-out-a-property/rent-increases" title="Rent increases">increase the rent</a> after carrying out repairs and improvements, depending on the <a href="/tenancy-agreements-a-guide-for-landlords/tenancy-types" title="Tenancy types">tenancy agreement</a>. </p>

</article><article id="rent-increases"><header><h1>Part 3: Rent increases</h1>
  </header><p>The <a href="/private-renting-tenancy-agreements/overview" title="Private renting: tenancy agreements">tenancy agreement</a> should include how and when you will review the rent.</p>

<h2>When you can increase rent</h2>

<p>For a periodic tenancy (rolling on a week-by-week or month-by-month basis) you can’t normally increase the rent more than once a year without your tenants’ agreement.</p>

<p>For a fixed-term tenancy (running for a set period) you can only increase the rent if your tenants agree. If they don’t agree, you can only increase the rent when the fixed-term ends.</p>

<h2>General rules around rent increases</h2>

<p>For any tenancy you must get your tenants’ permission if you want to increase the rent by more than previously agreed.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The rent increase must be fair and realistic (ie in line with average local rents).</p>
</div>

<h2>How you can increase the rent</h2>

<p>If the tenancy agreement says how the rent can be increased, you must stick to this. Otherwise, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>renew the tenancy agreement at the end of the fixed term, but with an increased rent</li>
  <li>agree a rent increase with your tenants and produce a written record of the agreement that you both sign</li>
  <li>use a <a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/assuredtenancyforms" title="Department for Communities and Local Government (Assured tenancy forms)">‘Landlord’s notice proposing a new rent’ form,</a> which increases the rent after the fixed term has ended</li>
</ul>
<p>You must give your tenants a minimum of one month’s notice (if they pay rent weekly or monthly). If they have a yearly tenancy, you must give 6 months’ notice.</p>

<h2>Rent assessment committee</h2>
<p>If your tenants think the rent increase is unfair, they can ask a rent assessment committee to decide the rent amount.</p>

</article><article id="settling-disputes"><header><h1>Part 4: Settling disputes</h1>
  </header><p>You can often sort out disputes with your tenants without going to court:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Speak to your tenants about your concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this doesn’t work, write a formal letter setting out the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a <a href="/how-to-resolve-neighbour-disputes/use-a-mediation-service" title="Use a mediation service">mediation service</a>, which is usually cheaper and quicker than going to court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a last resort, you can take your tenants to court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Going to court</h2>

<p>If you take legal action, the case may go to a <a href="/make-court-claim-for-money/overview" title="Make a court claim for money">small claims court</a>. Small claims cases are those worth less than £5,000 (or £1,000 if the case is about repairs to a property).</p>

<p>The courts provide a free mediation service for small claims cases, which can take place over the phone.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you want to get your property back because your tenants owe you rent money, you can <a href="https://www.possessionclaim.gov.uk/pcol/" title="Recover property-related debt using Possession Claim Online" rel="external">make a possession claim online</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Free advice for disputes</h2>

<p>You can get free advice about disputes or housing problems from <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice/" title="Citizens Advice Bureau">Citizens Advice</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/how_we_can_help/housing_advice_helpline/" title="Shelter">Shelter.</a> </p>

<p>In Wales, you can contact <a rel="external" href="http://www.sheltercymru.org.uk/get/default.aspx?parentid=2" title="Shelter Cymru">Shelter Cymru</a></p>

<p>A solicitor can also help you, but they might charge a fee.</p>

<p>If you have to go to court, you can get advice on the day of the hearing from the housing duty desk at the court.</p>

</article><article id="houses-in-multiple-occupation-hmo"><header><h1>Part 5: Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO)</h1>
  </header><p>If you let your property to several tenants who aren’t members of the same family, it may be a ‘House in Multiple Occupation’ (<abbr title="House in Multiple Occupation">HMO</abbr>). </p>

<p>Your property is an <abbr title="House in Multiple Occupation">HMO</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>at least 3 tenants live there, forming more than 1 household</li>
  <li>toilet, bathroom or kitchen facilities are shared</li>
</ul>
<p>A household consists of either a single person or members of the same family who live together. It includes people who are married or living together and people in same-sex relationships.</p>

<h2>Licences</h2>

<p>An <abbr title="House in Multiple Occupation">HMO</abbr> must have a licence if it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 or more storeys high</li>
  <li>occupied by 5 or more people</li>
</ul>
<p>A local council can also include other types of HMOs for licensing. </p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=149&amp;LGIL=8&amp;ServiceName=Find%20out%20about%20council%20rent%20inspections%20of%20shared%20accommodation">Find out if you need an <abbr title="House in Multiple Occupation">HMO</abbr> licence</a> from your local council.</p>

<h2>Risk assessment</h2>
<p>The local council has to carry out a Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) risk assessment on your <abbr title="House in Multiple Occupation">HMO</abbr> within 5 years of receiving a licence application. If the inspector finds any unacceptable risks during the assessment, you must carry out work to eliminate them.</p>

<h2>Reporting changes</h2>
<p>You must tell the local council if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you plan to make changes to an <abbr title="House in Multiple Occupation">HMO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>your tenants make changes</li>
  <li>your tenants’ circumstances change (eg they have a child)</li>
</ul></article><article id="paying-tax"><header><h1>Part 6: Paying tax</h1>
  </header><p>When you start renting out property, you must tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). If you don’t, you can be fined.</p>

<p>Call the Self Assessment Helpline if you need to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> about your business.</p>

<h2>Working out your profits</h2>
<p>When working out the profits from renting out your property for tax purposes, you can’t deduct the cost of:</p>

<ul>
<li>buying the property</li>
  <li>altering or improving property</li>
  <li>depreciation</li>
  <li>any losses when you sell the property</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, you may be able to claim tax allowances called <a href="/capital-allowances" title="Capital allowances">capital allowances</a>.</p>

<h2>Capital allowances</h2>
<p>There are different types of allowance you can claim against the cost of buying or replacing things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>furniture</li>
  <li>fixtures and fittings (eg cupboards, plumbing and electrical installations)</li>
  <li>equipment you need to run your business (eg a computer or stationery)</li>
  <li>equipment that isn’t just for the use of a single let property, like a new fire alarm system for a block of flats</li>
</ul>
<h3>What you can claim</h3>
<p>For furniture and equipment provided with a furnished residential letting, you can claim either:</p>

<ul>
<li>10% of the net rent as a ‘wear and tear allowance’ - net rent is the rent received, less any costs you pay that a tenant would usually pay (eg Council Tax)</li>
  <li>the cost of replacing furniture or equipment, including small items like cutlery</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve chosen which of these allowances to claim for a property, you can’t switch between them from year to year. </p>

</div>

<h2>Other expenses</h2>
<p>As well as capital allowances, you can also claim for some ‘allowable expenses’ (money you need to spend in the running of your business), such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>letting agent’s fees</li>
  <li>legal fees for lets of a year or less, or for renewing a lease for less than 50 years</li>
  <li>accountant’s fees</li>
  <li>buildings and contents insurance</li>
  <li>interest on property loans</li>
  <li>maintenance and repairs to the property (but not improvements)</li>
  <li>utility bills such as gas, water and electricity</li>
  <li>rent, ground rent, service charges</li>
  <li>Council Tax</li>
  <li>services you pay for, such as cleaning or gardening</li>
  <li>other direct costs of letting the property, such as phone calls, stationery and advertising</li>
</ul>
<h2>Losses</h2>
<p>If you make a loss on renting, you can carry it forward to a later year and offset it against future profits.</p>

<h2>How to claim</h2>
<p>You claim through either your:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns/overview" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Income Tax Self Assessment</a></li>
  <li><a href="/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company" title="Prepare and file annual accounts for a limited company">Corporation Tax return</a></li>
