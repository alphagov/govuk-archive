<ul>
<li>doesn’t have to be paid back </li>
  <li>won’t affect your other benefits </li>
  <li>is tax-free </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">

<ul>
<li>have started claiming the benefit before 1 October 2012</li>
  <li>go straight from claiming benefits to starting work </li>
  <li>expect the work to last at least 5 weeks </li>
  <li>work at least 16 hours a week - this can be in different jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, you must have been getting one of these benefits for at least 26 weeks before starting work:</p>

<li>Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
  <li>Incapacity Benefit</li>

  <li>Employment Zone payments (where the allowance is based on Jobseeker’s Allowance)</li>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>There will be no new Job Grant payments from 1 April 2013.</p>
