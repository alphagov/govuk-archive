  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If your child is taken into care because of a care order, your council will share responsibility for making <a href="/parental-rights-responsibilities/what-is-parental-responsibility" title="What is parental responsibility?">most of the important decisions</a> about your child’s upbringing, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>who looks after them</li>
  <li>where they live</li>
  <li>how they are educated</li>
</ul>
<p>If you agree to your child becoming ‘looked after’ and there is no care order, you’ll continue to have parental responsibility for your child.</p>

<p>In either case, the council is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>making sure that an appropriate standard of care is provided</li>
  <li>making sure only suitable people are employed to look after your child</li>
  <li>providing proper training and support to staff and foster carers</li>
  <li>listening to your child’s views and your views about care arrangements and taking their religion, race, culture and background into account</li>
  <li>making sure your child has someone independent to talk to and knows how to complain if necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>The child may be placed with either:</p>

<ul>
<li>another relative</li>
  <li>a foster carer</li>
  <li>a children’s home</li>
</ul>
<h2>Care orders</h2>

<p>A care order is given by a court. It allows a council to take a child into care. Under the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/part/IV" title="Children's Act 1989">Children’s Act 1989,</a> a council can apply for a care order if it believes a child is suffering or at risk of suffering significant harm. </p>

<p>The court decides if the child can be taken into care. </p>

<p>Care orders last until:</p>

<ul>
<li>the child’s 18th birthday</li>
  <li>an order is made giving parental responsibility to another person - eg through adoption</li>
  <li>the court lifts the order (this is called ‘discharging’ the order)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A child can be taken into care if they are under 18.</p>
</div>

<h2>Making a complaint</h2>

<p>If your child is in care and you’re unhappy about their treatment, you can make a complaint. Talk to your child’s carer or social worker first and if you’re not happy, you can <a href="/complain-about-your-council" title="Complain about your council">complain to your council</a>.</p>

<h2>Support for parents</h2>

<p>The Family Rights Group Advice Service helpline provides confidential support for parents:</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Family Rights Group helpline</strong>  </p>

<p>0800 731 1696<br>
Monday to Friday, 10am to 3:30pm</p>
</div>

</article><article id="care-proceedings"><header><h1>Part 2: Care proceedings</h1>
  </header><p>If the council is very worried about a child, it can start ‘care proceedings’. </p>

<p>If it believes that the child should be adopted, it can apply for a ‘placement order’ as well. This allows the council to place the child with suitable adopters.</p>

<h2>Interim care orders</h2>

<p>At the start of care proceedings, the council asks the family court to make a temporary court order, called an ‘interim care order’. </p>

<p>If the court agrees, the council can take the child into care on a temporary basis. This can be for up to 8 weeks at first. After that, it can be renewed every 28 days.</p>

<h2>Looking at the case</h2>

<p>It can take up to a year for a court to decide what should happen to the child. Sometimes it can take even longer than this. </p>

<p>During this time a social worker, an officer from the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (<abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>) and other people will be trying to understand the reasons why the child may be at risk. They will also look at what can be done to keep them safe. </p>

<p>They will talk to the parents and the child. They may talk to other family members or friends about looking after the child if they can’t safely live at home. The parents might also get support.</p>

<h2>Reports</h2>

<p>The social worker and <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> officer will each write a report for the court. These will outline what they think should happen to the child. </p>

<p>They will include whether they think the child should be taken into care or stay with the family. </p>

<p>Once all the information has been gathered, there will be a court hearing.</p>


</article><article id="going-to-court"><header><h1>Part 3: Going to court</h1>
  </header><p>Once all the information has been gathered, there will be a court hearing. The judge will look at the reports, and listen to everyone involved in the case, including: </p>

<ul>
<li>the child</li>
  <li>the parents</li>
  <li>solicitors representing parents and children</li>
  <li>the council social worker</li>
  <li>the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (<abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>) officer </li>
</ul>
<p>If the judge decides that the child is safe, they will go back home. If not, the council will find them a new home. That may be with:</p>

<ul>
<li>other members of their family</li>
  <li>friends</li>
  <li>a new family</li>
  <li>a children’s home</li>
</ul>
<h2>What <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> does</h2>

<p>In care proceedings, a Children’s Guardian from <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> represents the rights and interests of the child. They spend time getting to know the child and their family before the hearing. </p>

<p>The Children’s Guardian:</p>

<ul>
<li>appoints a solicitor for the child</li>
  <li>advises the court about what needs to be done before it can make a decision</li>
  <li>writes a report for the court saying what would be best for the child – including the child’s wishes and feelings</li>
</ul>
<p>The Children’s Guardian spends time with the child and their family before they write their report for the court. They may also talk to other people who know the family, like teachers, social workers and health visitors. </p>

<p>They go to meetings about the child, check records and read the council’s case file. They may also recommend to the court that other independent professionals help the court with advice, eg a doctor or a psychologist.</p>

<p><abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> workers are independent – they don’t work for the council or the court. </p>

</article><article id="educating-children-in-care"><header><h1>Part 4: Educating children in care</h1>
  </header><p>If your child is taken into care, the council will be responsible for his or her education. There will also be a ‘designated teacher’, who is responsible for all of the children in care at your child’s school. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your child will have an overall care plan, which will include education.</p>
</div>

<p>Most of the decisions about the child’s welfare will be taken by their social worker and foster carer (or residential care worker). You might also be involved depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>The social worker is responsible for making sure your child can achieve their potential, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>drawing up a personal education plan for them</li>
  <li>making sure they are well supported at school</li>
  <li>making sure they go to school every day</li>
  <li>choosing and applying for a school place when required</li>
  <li>making sure that there are good links between social services and the child’s designated teacher</li>
  <li>being involved in any assessment for <a href="/children-with-special-educational-needs/overview" title="Children with special educational needs">special educational needs</a>
</li>
  <li>making sure that foster carers attend parents’ evenings and any other school events which parents would attend</li>
