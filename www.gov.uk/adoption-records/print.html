  </header><p>If you were adopted or if you’re a birth relative of an adopted person, you can add yourself to the Adoption Contact Register to express an interest in finding your family. </p>

<p>You can also use it to say you don’t want to be contacted.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">

</div>

<h2>If you were adopted - finding birth relatives</h2>

<p>You can add yourself to the Adoption Contact Register if you’re 18 or over and your birth or adoption was registered with the General Register Office. You need:</p>

<ul>
<li>your original birth name</li>
  <li>your date of birth</li>
  <li>the full name(s) of your birth mother (and birth father if known)</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you don’t have your birth records</h3>

<p>You can apply to get your birth records using the forms below. If you were adopted outside England or Wales, you need to contact the General Register Office in the country where you were adopted.</p>

<p>If you were adopted before 1975 you’ll need to attend a counselling session with an approved adoption advisor first.</p>

<h2>If you’re a birth relative - finding an adopted person</h2>

<p>You can add yourself to the register to try to find an adopted person - you’ll only be able to find people who have also added themselves to it. </p>

<p>You need to be 18 or over. </p>

<p>The fee is £30 - instructions on how to pay are on the form. You can also use this form if you are an adopted person looking for other adopted siblings.</p>

<p>You can also apply to make contact with an adopted person through an approved <a href="/adoption-records/intermediary-agencies" title="intermediary agency">intermediary agency</a>. </p>

</article><article id="intermediary-agencies"><header><h1>Part 2: Intermediary agencies</h1>
  </header><p>You can use an intermediary agency to trace your family if:</p>

<ul>
<li>a birth relative of yours was adopted before 30 December 2005</li>
  <li>you were adopted before 30 December 2005</li>
</ul>
<p>When an intermediary agency finds a person, you can only contact them if they agree to it. If they don’t agree, the agency won’t tell you their name or whereabouts but might be able to share some information, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>their domestic or family circumstances</li>
  <li>their general health and well-being</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you don’t want to be contacted</h2>

<p>Birth relatives or adopted people can use the <a href="the-adoption-contact-register" title="adoption contact register">adoption contact register</a> to say that they don’t want to be contacted. </p>

<p>If you don’t want to be approached by an intermediary agency, you can tell your agency and register a veto. There are 2 types of veto called an ‘absolute veto’ and a ‘qualified veto’.</p>

<h3>An ‘absolute veto’</h3>

<p>This means an intermediary agency can’t approach you under any circumstances (your adoption agency can still pass on information to you, eg about a hereditary medical condition or details of an inheritance).</p>

<h3>A ‘qualified veto’</h3>

<p>This means you can say when you would be prepared to be contacted (eg you could say that an approach on behalf of your birth parent wouldn’t be acceptable, but an approach by a sibling would).</p>

<h2>More help and information</h2>

<p>For further information on intermediary services you can contact:</p>
