<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Highways Agency aims to provide safe roads, reliable journeys and to inform travellers of the condition and flow of the road network. To be able to offer an efficient service, the Highways Agency procures from and works with many different suppliers of goods and services.</p>

<p>In this guide, you will find details on the types of goods and services the Highways Agency procures and the strategy behind this procurement. There is also information on the working relationship between the Highways Agency and their suppliers, how a potential supplier is chosen and where you can find Highways Agency work advertised.</p>

<h2 id="the-role-of-the-highways-agency">The role of the Highways Agency</h2>

<p>The strategic road network in England provides essential support for business, industry, social and leisure life. The network is made up of motorways and major A roads and carries a third of all road traffic and two thirds of all heavy freight traffic.</p>

<p>The Highways Agency is an executive agency of the Department for Transport, and works on behalf of the Secretary of State for Transport. The main tasks of the Highways Agency are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>manage traffic</li>
  <li>tackle congestion</li>
  <li>provide information to road users</li>
  <li>improve safety and journey time reliability</li>
  <li>encourage road users to respect the environment</li>
  <li>minimise environmental damage from road transport</li>
</ul>
<p>The Highways Agency Standards for Highways website carries information about the design, construction and maintenance of the English strategic road network. It also links to sources of other useful information for highways construction professionals. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/standards-for-highways-online-resources">Standards for Highways online resources</a>.</p>

<p>The Highways Agency works closely with partners and contractors to ensure the network is safe and efficient and meets the needs of every road user. They require all suppliers to employ fully qualified and registered operatives, with relevant National Highway Sector Schemes (<abbr title="National Highway Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr>) registration/skills cards. The Highways Agency usually also require contractors and sub-contractors to attend <abbr title="National Highway Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr>. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/the-highways-agency-skills-card-and-registration-requirements-for-suppliers">skills card and registration requirements for suppliers of the Highways Agency</a>.</p>

<p>To tender for a Highways Agency contract, your business may need to hold certain accreditations and certificates, and you may need to have your capabilities assessed. For more information, see how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/the-highways-agency-tendering-for-projects">tender for Highways Agency projects</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/about-us/">find out about the aims, objectives and values of the Highways Agency on its website</a>.</p>

<p>The Highways Agency has offices throughout the country and traffic officers, based in seven regional control centres and 31 outstations, who perform work on motorways.</p>

<h3 id="corporate-identity">Corporate identity</h3>

<p>The Highways Agency works with a variety of suppliers, contractors and consultants, whilst still keeping a clear and consistent corporate identity. If you work for the Highways Agency, you will need to comply with several visual identity guidelines to stay consistent with the corporate brand. The Highways Agency will provide you with information on logos, colours and sizes, co-branding, vehicle branding and general rules for publications.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/publications/guidance-and-best-practice-ha-visual-identity/">Download visual identity guidelines for working with the Highways Agency from the Highways Agency website (PDF, 3.48MB)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-highways-agencys-approach-to-procurement">The Highways Agency’s approach to procurement</h2>

<p>Procurement is the complete process of obtaining goods and services. Almost all Highways Agency services are procured through third parties - eg contractors, maintaining agents and consultants. The Highways Agency has an effective procurement practice and maintains good relationships with supply chains to ensure the effective delivery of high-quality services to road users.</p>

<h3 id="highways-agency-procurement-strategy">Highways Agency procurement strategy</h3>

<p>The Highways Agency follows an ethical approach to procurement and is committed to public-sector best practice. In commercial activities, the Highways Agency applies the highest standards of professionalism, ethical conduct and impartiality. Competitive processes are governed by European Union law and UK legislation and conducted in accordance with Office of Government Commerce standards.</p>

<p>The Highways Agency has a procurement strategy setting out their approach to procurement of goods, services and construction expertise. The strategy is structured around value for money, delivery and sustainability and sets out a prioritised plan of actions.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/documents/Procurement_Strategy_2009-10.pdf">Download information on the Highways Agency’s aim to deliver sustainable value through supply chain management from the Highways Agency website (PDF, 1.2MB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="value-for-money">Value for money</h3>

<p>To maximise value for money, the Highways Agency has to manage and control cost, time and quality requirements. These factors, as well as risk and value, are reviewed for each potential procurement and used by the Highways Agency to decide their approach.</p>

<p>The Highways Agency aims to work more closely with suppliers to improve value through their supply chains. They are moving to a more commercial, businesslike approach with suppliers, and with past performances determining future opportunities of work.</p>

<p>The Highways Agency maps supply chain patterns and contributions to help the procurement of common goods and services - such as barriers, gantries, signs and surfacing materials - on a category basis. This strategy is expected to develop further across a range of requirements, providing increased value through greater efficiency and lower unit costs.</p>

<p>The Highways Agency uses long-term, relational contracts for large-scale projects, and a shorter term, transactional approach for routine needs. Another goal of the Highways Agency is to develop metrics to measure and manage the value delivered by them and their suppliers.</p>

<h3 id="highways-agency-delivery">Highways Agency delivery</h3>

<p>The Highways Agency aims to deliver safe roads, reliable journeys and good information to travellers and procurement is essential for this plan to succeed. The Highways Agency selects suppliers who:</p>

<ul>
<li>represent value for money</li>
  <li>can deliver on time and to cost</li>
  <li>work hard to maintain Highways Agency reputation and standards</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sustainability-in-highways-agency">Sustainability in Highways Agency</h3>

<p>The Highways Agency uses procurement to support government sustainability priorities and to monitor supplier response. The Highways Agency and their suppliers must consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>sustainable consumption and production</li>
  <li>climate change</li>
  <li>natural resources</li>
  <li>sustainable communities</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-highways-agencys-relationship-with-suppliers">The Highways Agency’s relationship with suppliers</h2>

<p>In order to work effectively with the Highways Agency you must ensure that your business has the appropriate culture, processes and procedures to ensure sound management.</p>

<p>The Highways Agency will expect all their suppliers to:</p>

<ul>
<li>be as transparent as possible</li>
  <li>avoid all links to fraud or conflict of interest in their business and supply chain</li>
  <li>follow Highways Agency values and focus on achieving customer satisfaction in terms of safe roads, reliable journeys and informed travellers</li>
  <li>be able to deliver the level of quality needed</li>
  <li>have the highest ethical standards, including promoting equality and eradicating any discrimination or harassment</li>
  <li>deliver year-on-year efficiency</li>
  <li>manage and deliver their own performance to all aspects of the contract, addressing issues before Highways Agency measurement and intervention</li>
  <li>adhere to all appropriate legislation, including taking responsibility for understanding obligations under the Highways Agency’s data handling policy</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with the Highways Agency can also benefit your business. They will work with you:</p>

<ul>
<li>to develop innovative and lean ways of working, making use of technology and improving performance</li>
  <li>to follow fair and prompt payment initiatives</li>
  <li>and others, such as local authorities, whenever there is an opportunity to improve performance</li>
</ul>
<p>The Highways Agency will promote the benefits of a diverse and competitive supply chain and engage with suppliers to utilise opportunities for improving capability, capacity and expertise.</p>

<p>This strategy will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>gathering market intelligence and encouraging competition</li>
  <li>engaging and developing supplier relationships through regular communications and meetings</li>
  <li>exploring new market opportunities</li>
  <li>consulting with industry on new initiatives, managing standards and offering opportunities to a diverse supply base and new suppliers</li>
  <li>maintaining regular face-to-face dialogue with strategic partners</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="becoming-a-supplier-for-the-highways-agency">Becoming a supplier for the Highways Agency</h2>

<p>In order to become a supplier of goods and services to the Highways Agency, you must compete against other businesses for the contract, except when competition is unnecessary - eg in a monopoly supply situation.</p>

<h3 id="highways-agency-advertising">Highways Agency advertising</h3>

<p>The Highways Agency has an obligation under European Union Procurement Directives to advertise contracts in the Tenders Electronic Daily (<abbr title="Tenders Electronic Daily">TED</abbr>) and supplements to the Official Journal of the European Union (<abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr>). In some cases, the Highways Agency also issues prior information notices which describe contracts that will be formally advertised in the near future. <a rel="external" href="http://ted.europa.eu/TED/main/HomePage.do">Register for the latest issue of the <abbr title="Tenders Electronic Daily">TED</abbr> on the Europa website</a>.</p>

<p>There is also an e-procurement portal where an increasing number of Highways Agency opportunities are advertised. You can find details of <a rel="external" href="https://highways.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.shtml">upcoming tendering opportunities on the Highways Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>If the contract is below the <abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr> threshold and not advertised through the e-procurement portal, it can also be found on the Highways Agency website. Find <a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/6164.htm">upcoming schemes below the <abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr> threshold on the Highways Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also find details of <a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/13036.aspx">current and forthcoming Highways Agency contracts on the Highways Agency website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sub-contracting-opportunities-with-the-highways-agency">Sub-contracting opportunities with the Highways Agency</h3>

<p>The majority of Highways Agency spending on maintaining the road network is controlled by long-term contracts. However, there may be opportunities for suppliers to provide services as subcontractors to the principal suppliers. You are allowed to contact current Highways Agency suppliers to register interest. Download a <a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/documents/CAT3_suppliers_data.pdf">list of first tier suppliers from the Highways Agency website (PDF, 14K)</a>. Please note that the suppliers listed here do not necessarily have a current contract with the Highways Agency.</p>

<p>Find details of <a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/13036.aspx">current and forthcoming Highways Agency subcontracting opportunities on the Highways Agency website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="terms-and-conditions">Terms and conditions</h3>

<p>Model contract documents (<abbr title="model contract documents">MCDs</abbr>) are provided to suppliers as a guide only. Specific contract documentation can differ from <abbr title="model contract documents">MCDs</abbr> and is issued by the procurement officer at the tender stage. You can find and download <a rel="external" href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/about-us/procurement/supplier-selection-and-development/model-contract-documents/"><abbr title="model contract documents">MCDs</abbr> on the Highways Agency website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-highways-agency-buys">What the Highways Agency buys</h2>

<p>The Highways Agency buys goods and services in six main areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>consultancy - both technical and civil engineering</li>
  <li>highways improvement</li>
  <li>highways maintenance</li>
  <li>traffic technology</li>
  <li>audit</li>
  <li>vehicles and uniforms - eg for the traffic officer service</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consultancy">Consultancy</h3>

<p>Consultancy services are provided to the Highways Agency through framework arrangements, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Project Support Framework - for civil engineering consultancy advice, specialist surveys, contract facilitation, statistical analysis and contract development</li>
  <li>the National Technical Consultancy Framework - for geotechnics, pavement engineering, environmental operations, traffic appraisal and quantity surveying</li>
  <li>the Technology Consultancy Framework - for advice and support to the Highways Agency traffic technology team</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="highways-improvement">Highways improvement</h3>

<p>New Engineering Contract (<abbr title="New Engineering Contract">NEC3</abbr>) contracts deliver major projects that cost more than £20 million. Each project has its own procurement strategy developed on a case-by-case basis, with the most appropriate contract model being used.</p>

<p>Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) contracts are for projects which benefit from input by a contractor prior to submission to the planning process. The Late ECI contract allows a contractor to be hired closer to construction start but still before submission to the planning process.</p>

<p>When a contractor is hired after planning consents have been obtained, or when planning consents are not required, an <abbr title="New Engineering Contract">NEC3</abbr>-based design and build contract is used.</p>

<h3 id="highways-maintenance">Highways maintenance</h3>

<p>The main contractual vehicle for maintaining, operating and improving the Highways Agency network is the Managing Agent Contractor (<abbr title="Managing Agent Contractor">MAC</abbr>) contract. The <abbr title="Managing Agent Contractor">MAC</abbr> delivers all routine and winter service works, renewal schemes up to a £500,000 threshold and contract management duties on schemes above the threshold. There are seven essential areas that <abbr title="Managing Agent Contractor">MAC</abbr> service providers supply, without compromising safety:</p>

<ul>
<li>effective winter service</li>
  <li>rapid and effective response to defects</li>
  <li>planned maintenance programme - to minimise number and duration of incidents</li>
  <li>programme of congestion-easing schemes - developed and implemented</li>
  <li>reduction in incident clear-up times</li>
  <li>improved quality of information on roadworks, incidents, events and alternative routes</li>
  <li>operating as an integrated team</li>

<p>TechMACs are a similar arrangement that cover the maintenance of technology.</p>

<p>The preferred procurement route for maintenance works over £500,000 is through four-year works frameworks. The Highways Agency has developed an Asset Management Framework which can deliver:</p>

<ul>
<li>managed works - a number of main civil engineering contractors given a task order for each scheme</li>
  <li>construction management - appointment of specialist contractors several of whom are given task orders to complete a single scheme with the <abbr title="Managing Agent Contractor">MAC</abbr> acting as supervisor and principal contractor</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="traffic-technology">Traffic technology</h3>

<p>There are three areas to traffic technology and where possible contracts provide whole life support. These areas cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>roadside devices, such as message signs, CCTV and other associated sundry equipment - eg cabinets, power supply units - obtained through national frameworks</li>
  <li>control systems and software support - mostly obtained through fixed-term contracts</li>
  <li>technical consultancy support services - mostly obtained through fixed-term contracts</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="audit">Audit</h3>

<p>Framework agreements are used for Highways Agency audit services - such as audit assurance and advice. Audits vary depending on requirements and are planned and conducted in agreement with project sponsors within Highways Agency functional areas.</p>

<h3 id="traffic-officer-service">Traffic officer service</h3>

<p>The many areas of the traffic officer service are provided through different agreements and contracts, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>the framework agreement - uniforms, training</li>
  <li>a bespoke contract - the maintenance and washing of uniforms</li>
  <li>recruitment contracts - for both the recruitment of permanent members of the traffic officer service and temporary operators for the regional control centres</li>
  <li>fixed contract, following Official Journal of the European Union procedure - an audio magazine and translation service</li>
</ul>
