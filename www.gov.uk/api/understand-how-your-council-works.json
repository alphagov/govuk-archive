This can be a city, borough or county council - or it may just be called ‘council’.</p>\n\n<p>As well as these, many areas also have parish or town councils. </p>\n\n<h2>County councils</h2>\n<p>These are responsible for services across the whole of a county, like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>education</li>\n  <li>transport</li>\n  <li>planning</li>\n  <li>fire and public safety</li>\n  <li>social care</li>\n  <li>libraries</li>\n  <li>waste management</li>\n  <li>trading standards</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>District, borough and city councils</h2>\n<p>These cover a smaller area than county councils. They’re usually responsible for services like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>rubbish collection</li>\n  <li>recycling</li>\n  <li>Council Tax collections</li>\n  <li>housing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Unitary authorities</h2>\n<p>In some parts of the country, one tier of local government provides all the local services listed above.</p>\n\n<h2>Parish, community and town councils</h2>\n<p>These operate at a level below district and borough councils and in some cases, unitary authorities. They&rsquo;re elected and can help on a number of local issues, like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>planning applications</li>\n  <li>running sports grounds</li>\n  <li>running community halls</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/understand-how-your-council-works/decision-making","slug":"decision-making","order":2,"title":"Decision making","body":"<p>The full council (a meeting of all council members) is responsible for all decisions.

They carry out ceremonial duties and chair meetings, but can&rsquo;t make decisions about council business.</p>\n\n<p>Some councils have an elected mayor. They&rsquo;re responsible for the day-to-day running of local services. </p>\n\n<p>Councils can have both elected and civic mayors.</p>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/understand-how-your-council-works/spending-and-accounts","slug":"spending-and-accounts","order":3,"title":"Spending and accounts","body":"<p>Many <a href=\"/find-your-local-council\" title=\"Find your local council\">local councils</a> provide information on their websites to show how they spend their budget.</p>\n\n<p>You can view details of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>payments for goods and services over £500</li>\n  <li>contracts and tenders over £500</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Looking at annual accounts</h2>\n<p>Every year councils must open their detailed financial accounts to the public for 20 working days. </p>\n\n<p>This allows you to check any spending under £500 without having to <a href=\"/make-a-freedom-of-information-request\" title=\"Make a freedom of information request\">make a freedom of information request</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Your council must publish on its website and in the local press details of when you can check its accounts.</p>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/understand-how-your-council-works/local-councillors","slug":"local-councillors","order":4,"title":"Local councillors","body":"<p>Local councillors are elected by the local community to represent its views.</p>\n\n<p>You can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.writetothem.com/\" title=\"Contact your councillor, MP or AM\">contact your local councillor online</a> or by going to an advice surgery. </p>\n\n<h2>Declaring interests</h2>\n<p>All local councillors have to declare any interests, gifts or hospitality they get that could influence decisions they make. </p>\n\n<p>Your local council must publish details of these.
