at work or the type of job a person does, they may only have the right to take rest later (eg during the same or following day). </p>\n\n<p>This is known as ‘compensatory rest’ which is the same length of time as the break (or part of it) that they’ve missed. </p>\n\n<p>A worker may be entitled to compensatory rest if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>their workplace is a long way from their home (eg an oil rig) </li>\n  <li>they work in different places which are a reasonable distance from each other </li>\n  <li>they&rsquo;re doing security and surveillance-based work </li>\n  <li>they&rsquo;re

an accident or a risk that an accident is about to happen </li>\n  <li>the job needs round-the-clock staffing so there aren&rsquo;t interruptions to any services or production (eg hospital work)</li>\n  <li>they work in the rail industry on board trains or their job is linked to making sure trains run on time</li>\n  <li>they&rsquo;re a shift worker and they can&rsquo;t take daily or
