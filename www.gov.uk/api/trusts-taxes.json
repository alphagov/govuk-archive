Find out more by reading the information on different <a href=\"/trusts-taxes/types-of-trust\" title=\"types of trust\">types of trust</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What trustees do</h2>\n\n<p>The trustees are the legal owners of the assets held in a trust. Their role is to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>deal with the assets according to the trust deed</li>\n  <li>manage the trust on a day-to-day basis and pay any tax due</li>\n  <li>decide how to invest or use the trust&rsquo;s assets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the trustees change, the trust can still continue, but there always has to be at least 1 trustee.</p>\n\n<h2>Beneficiaries</h2>\n\n<p>There might be more than 1 beneficiary, like a whole family or defined group of people. They may benefit from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the income of a trust only - eg from renting out a house held in a trust</li>\n  <li>the capital only - eg getting shares held in a trust when they reach a certain age</li>\n  <li>both the income and capital of the trust</li>\n</ul>\n\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/trusts-taxes/types-of-trust","slug":"types-of-trust","order":2,"title":"Types of trust","body":"<p>The main types of trust are listed below - they&rsquo;re all taxed differently.</p>\n\n<p>Read the <a href=\"/trusts-taxes/overview\" title=\"overview\">overview</a> for definitions of &lsquo;trustee&rsquo;, &lsquo;settlor&rsquo; and &lsquo;beneficiary&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<h2>Bare trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are where the assets in a trust are held in the name of a trustee but go directly to the beneficiary, who has a right to both the capital and income of the trust. </p>\n\n<p>Bare trusts are often used to pass assets to young people - the trustees look after them until the beneficiary is 18 in England and Wales, or 16 in Scotland. </p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gary leaves his sister Juliet some money in his will. The money is held in trust. </p>\n\n<p>As the beneficiary Juliet is entitled to the money and any income (eg interest) it earns. She can also take possession of any of the money at any time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Interest in possession trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are trusts where the trustee must pass on all trust income to the beneficiary as it arises (less any expenses). </p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stanley creates a trust for all the shares he owned. </p>\n\n<p>The terms of the trust say that when he dies, the income from those shares goes to his wife for the rest of her life. When she dies, the shares will pass to their children.</p>\n\n<p>Stanley&rsquo;s wife is the income beneficiary and has an &lsquo;interest in possession&rsquo; in the trust. She doesn&rsquo;t have a right to the shares themselves.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Discretionary trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are where the trustees can decide how to use the trust income, and sometimes the capital.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the trust deed, trustees can decide:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>what gets paid out (income or capital)</li>\n  <li>which beneficiary to make payments to</li>\n  <li>how often payments are made</li>\n  <li>any conditions to impose on the beneficiaries</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Discretionary trusts are sometimes set up to put assets aside for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a future need, like a grandchild who may need more financial help than other beneficiaries at some point in their life</li>\n  <li>beneficiaries who aren&rsquo;t capable or responsible enough to deal with money themselves</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Accumulation trusts</h2>\n\n<p>This is where the trustees can accumulate income within the trust and add it to the trust&rsquo;s capital. They may also be able to pay income out, as with discretionary trusts.</p>\n\n<h2>Mixed trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are a combination of more than one type of trust. The different parts of the trust are treated according to the tax rules that apply to each part.</p>\n\n<h2>Settlor-interested trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are where the settlor or their spouse or civil partner benefits from the trust. The trust could be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>an interest in possession trust</li>\n  <li>an accumulation trust</li>\n  <li>a discretionary trust</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dave can no longer work due to illness.

This includes the assets in most trusts. </p>\n\n<p>There are some occasions where you may not have to pay Inheritance Tax - for example where the trust contains <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ihtmanual/IHTM04251.htm\" title=\"guidance on excluded property\">excluded property.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Special rules</h2>\n\n<p>Some <a href=\"/trusts-taxes/types-of-trust\" title=\"types of trust\">types of trust</a> are treated differently for Inheritance Tax purposes.</p>\n\n<h3>Bare trusts</h3>\n\n<p>These are where the assets in a trust are held in the name of a trustee but go directly to the beneficiary, who has a right to both the assets and income of the trust. </p>\n\n<p>Transfers into a bare trust may also be exempt from Inheritance Tax, as long as the person making the transfer survives for 7 years after making the transfer.</p>\n\n<h3>Interest in possession trusts</h3>\n\n<p>These are trusts where the beneficiary is entitled to trust income as it&rsquo;s produced - this is called their &lsquo;interest in possession&rsquo;. </p>\n\n<p>On assets transferred into this type of trust before 22 March 2006, there&rsquo;s no Inheritance Tax to pay. </p>\n\n<p>On assets transferred on or after 22 March 2006, the 10-yearly Inheritance Tax charge may be due.</p>\n\n<p>During the life of the trust there&rsquo;s no Inheritance Tax to pay as long as the asset stays in the trust and remains the &lsquo;interest&rsquo; of the beneficiary.</p>\n\n<p>Between 22 March 2006 and 5 October 2008:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>beneficiaries of an interest in possession trust could pass on their interest in possession to other beneficiaries, like their children</li>\n  <li>this was called making a &lsquo;transitional serial interest&rsquo;</li>\n  <li>there&rsquo;s no Inheritance Tax to pay in this situation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From 5 October 2008:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>beneficiaries of an interest in possession trust can&rsquo;t pass their interest on as a transitional serial interest</li>\n  <li>if an interest is transferred after this date there may be a charge of 20% and a 10-yearly Inheritance Tax charge will be payable unless it&rsquo;s a disabled trust</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If you inherit an interest in possession trust from someone who has died, there’s no Inheritance Tax at the 10-year anniversary. Instead, 40% tax will be due when you die.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>If the trust is set up by a will</h3>\n\n<p>Someone might ask that some or all of their assets are put into a trust. This is called a &lsquo;will trust&rsquo;. </p>\n\n<p>The personal representative of the deceased person has to make sure that the trust is properly set up with all taxes paid, and the trustees make sure that Inheritance Tax is paid on any future charges.</p>\n\n<h3>If the deceased transferred assets into a trust before they died</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re valuing the estate of someone who has died, you&rsquo;ll need to find out whether they made any transfers in the 7 years before they died. If they did, and they paid 20% Inheritance Tax, you&rsquo;ll need to pay an extra 20% from the estate. </p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Even if no Inheritance Tax was due on the transfer, you still have to add its value to the person’s estate when you’re valuing it for Inheritance Tax purposes.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Trusts for bereaved minors</h3>\n\n<p>A bereaved minor is a person under 18 who has lost at least 1 parent or step-parent. Where a trust is set up for a bereaved minor, there are no Inheritance Tax charges if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the assets in the trust are set aside just for bereaved minor</li>\n  <li>they become fully entitled to the assets by the age of 18 </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A trust for a bereaved young person can also be set up as an 18 to 25 trust - the 10-yearly charges don&rsquo;t apply. However, the main differences are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the beneficiary must become fully entitled to the assets in the trust by the age of 25</li>\n  <li>when the beneficiary is aged between 18 and 25, Inheritance Tax exit charges may apply </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Trusts for disabled beneficiaries</h3>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s no 10-yearly charge or exit charge on this type of trust as long as the asset stays in the trust and remains the &lsquo;interest&rsquo; of the beneficiary.</p>\n\n<p>You also don&rsquo;t have to pay Inheritance Tax on the transfer of assets into a trust for a disabled person as long as the person making the transfer survives for 7 years after making the transfer. </p>\n\n<h2>Paying Inheritance Tax</h2>\n\n<p>You pay Inheritance Tax using form IHT100.

If you&rsquo;re not sure what type of trust you have, ask the trustees.</p>\n\n<h2>Bare trusts</h2>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re the beneficiary of a bare trust you are responsible for declaring and paying tax on its income. You do this on your <a href=\"/self-assessment-tax-returns\" title=\"Self Assessment tax returns\">Self Assessment tax return</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Interest in possession trusts</h2>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re the beneficiary of this type of trust, you&rsquo;re entitled to its income as it arises.

With these trusts, all income paid to the spouse or civil partner is treated as though it has already been taxed at 50%. There&rsquo;s no more tax to pay. However, unlike payments made from other types of trusts, the tax credit can&rsquo;t be claimed back.</p>\n\n<h2>Non-resident trusts</h2>\n\n<p>This is a trust set up or managed by someone living abroad.
