If you enter into a cartel agreement you could receive an unlimited fine or a prison sentence of up to 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>Your business could be fined up to 10% of its turnover and company directors could be disqualified.</p>\n\n<h2>Report anti-competitive behaviour</h2>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Office of Fair Trading\">OFT</abbr> investigates claims of anti-competitive behaviour.
