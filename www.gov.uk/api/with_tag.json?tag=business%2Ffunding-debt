Invoice financiers can be independent, or part of a bank or financial institution.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of invoice financing in the UK.</p>\n\n<h2>Factoring</h2>\n\n<p>&lsquo;Factoring&rsquo; usually involves an invoice financier managing your sales ledger and collecting money owed by your customers themselves. This means your customers will know you&rsquo;re using invoice finance.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li><p>When you raise an invoice, the invoice financier will buy the debt owed to you by your customer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They make a percentage of the cost (usually around 85%) available to you upfront.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They then collect the full amount directly from your customer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Once they’ve received the money from your customer, they make the remaining balance available to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You’ll have to them pay a discount charge (interest) and fees - the amount depends on which invoice financier you use.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br />\nYou&rsquo;re owed £40,000 by a customer. You sell the invoice to an invoice financier for £34,000 (85%). They collect £40,000 from your customer and pay you the remaining £6,000 when they receive the money. You pay them interest and any fees you owe.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Invoice discounting</h2>\n\n<p>With &lsquo;invoice discounting&rsquo;, the invoice financier won&rsquo;t manage your sales ledger or collect debts on your behalf. Instead, they lend you money against your unpaid invoices - this is usually an agreed percentage of their total value. You&rsquo;ll have to pay them a fee.</p>\n\n<p>As your customers pay their invoices, the money goes to the invoice financier. This reduces the amount you owe, which means you can then borrow more money on invoices from new sales up to the percentage you originally agreed.</p>\n\n<p>If you use invoice discounting you&rsquo;ll still be responsible for collecting debts, but it can be arranged confidentially so your customers won&rsquo;t find out.</p>\n\n<h2>Advantages</h2>\n\n<p>Both kinds of invoice financing can provide a large and quick boost to your cash flow.</p>\n\n<p>Specific advantages of factoring include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the invoice financier will look after your sales ledger, freeing up your time to manage your business</li>\n  <li>they can help you to negotiate better terms with your suppliers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Specific advantages of invoice discounting include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>it can be arranged confidentially, so your customers won&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re borrowing against their invoices</li>\n  <li>it lets you maintain closer relationships with your customers, because you&rsquo;re still managing their accounts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Disadvantages</h2>\n\n<p>Some disadvantages of invoice financing are that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you’ll lose profit from orders or services that you provide</li>\n  <li>invoice financiers will usually only buy commercial invoices - if you sell to the public you might not be eligible </li>\n  <li>it may affect your ability to get other funding, as you won’t have &lsquo;book debts&rsquo; available as security</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you use factoring:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your customers may prefer to deal with you directly</li>\n  <li>it may affect what your customers think of you if the invoice financier deals with them badly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Find funding</h2>\n\n<p>You can look for either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://businessfinanceforyou.co.uk/\" title=\"Business Finance For You\">private finance providers</a> (eg banks)</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/business-finance-support-finder\" title=\"business finance and support finder\">public funding</a> (eg government schemes)</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/business-finance-explained/leasing-and-asset-finance","slug":"leasing-and-asset-finance","order":6,"title":"Leasing and asset finance","body":"<p>Leasing or renting assets (eg machinery or office equipment) can save you the initial costs of buying them outright.</p>\n\n<h2>Advantages</h2>\n\n<p>Advantages include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you’ll have access to a high standard of equipment that you might not have been able to afford otherwise</li>\n  <li>interest rates on monthly instalments are usually fixed</li>\n  <li>it&rsquo;s a less risky alternative to a secured bank loan -
