Hospital doctors or <abbr title=\"General Practitioners\">GPs</abbr> provide them. They can charge a fee if one is asked for before the 7th day. </p>\n\n<p>Employers can also ask employees to fill in a form when they return to work to confirm they&rsquo;ve been off sick for <strong>up to</strong> 7 days. This is called ‘self-certification’. Employers usually provide their own version of this form. </p>\n\n<div class=\"form-download\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/forms/sc2.pdf\" title=\"Download 'Employee's statement of sickness' (PDF, 50KB)\" rel=\"external\">Download ‘Employee’s statement of sickness’ (PDF, 50KB)</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Sick leave and holiday</h2>\n\n<p>Statutory holiday entitlement is built up (accrued) while an employee is off work sick (no matter how long they&rsquo;re off). </p>\n\n<p>Any statutory holiday entitlement that isn’t used because of illness can be carried over into the next leave year. </p>\n\n<p>Employees can choose to take holiday instead of sick leave. For example, because they don’t qualify for sick pay. Also, if an employee is ill just before or during their leave, they can take it as sick leave and take the missed leave at a later date. </p>\n\n<h3>Paying sick pay instead of holiday pay</h3>\n\n<p>When an employee changes their sick leave to holiday they&rsquo;re paid Statutory Sick Pay which will count towards the amount of holiday pay they&rsquo;ve received. The exceptions to this rule are: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>they don’t qualify for Statutory Sick Pay </li>\n  <li>they were off work sick and being paid ‘occupational sick pay’</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Returning to work</h2>\n\n<p>Employers should make changes to an employee’s working conditions if they become disabled because of their sickness. These changes are known as <a href=\"/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers\" title=\"reasonable adjustments\">&lsquo;reasonable adjustments&rsquo;</a> and could include working shorter hours or adapting equipment employees use at work.</p>\n\n<h2>Long-term sickness</h2>\n\n<p>Employees who are off work sick for more than 4 weeks may be considered long-term sick. </p>\n\n<p>As a last resort, employers can dismiss an employee who is long-term sick, but before they can do this employers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>must consider if an employee can return to work - eg working flexibly or part-time, doing different or less stressful work (with training if necessary) </li>\n  <li>must consult with employees about when they could return to work and if their health will improve</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If an employee thinks they’ve been unfairly dismissed they can take their case to an <a href=\"/employment-tribunals\" title=\"employment tribunals\">employment tribunal</a>.</p>\n\n","alternative_title":""},"tags":[{"title":"Holidays, time off, sick leave, maternity and paternity leave","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working%2Ftime-off.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes career breaks and the holiday entitlement calculator","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working%2Ftime-off","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/time-off"},"parent":{"title":"Working, jobs and pensions","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes holidays and finding a job","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/statutory-sick-pay-ssp.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay-ssp","title":"Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) ","format":"programme","updated_at":"2012-11-30T14:13:20+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/looking-for-work-if-youre-disabled.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/looking-for-work-if-youre-disabled","title":"Looking for work if you're disabled","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-12-17T09:56:55+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/employment-tribunals.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunals","title":"Take your employer to an employment tribunal","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-12-04T14:46:34+00:00"}]}
