If your child hasn’t got a place, your local council can tell you which schools have places available.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll be sent a letter with the decision about your child&rsquo;s school on 1 March. You can appeal against a decision to the admission authority for each school that does not offer a place. The letter will tell you how to do this. If you&rsquo;re appealing several rejections, make separate appeals.</p>\n\n<h2>Appeals for infant classes</h2>\n\n<p>For 5 to 7 year olds, the class size is limited to 30. Your application can be turned down if all the classes already have 30 children in them.</p>\n\n<p>You can still appeal if your child would have been offered a place. Your appeal could be successful if one of these is the case:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the admission arrangements haven&rsquo;t been properly followed</li>\n  <li>the admissions criteria aren&rsquo;t legal according to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/adminandfinance/schooladmissions/a00195/school-admissions-codes-and-regulations\" title=\"School Admissions Code\">School Admissions Code</a></li>\n  <li>the decision to refuse your child a place wasn&rsquo;t reasonable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Help preparing your appeal</h2>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.childrenslegalcentre.com/\" title=\"Coram Children's Legal Centre\">Coram Children&rsquo;s Legal Centre</a> can help you prepare your appeal.</p>\n\n<h2>When the hearing will be</h2>\n\n<p>The &lsquo;admission authority&rsquo; for the school (usually the school itself or the council) must give you at least 10 school days notice before the hearing to confirm the date.</p>\n\n<p>Appeals must be heard within 40 school days of the deadline for making an appeal.</p>\n\n<h2>What happens at the appeal hearing</h2>\n\n<p>At the appeal hearing, there&rsquo;s a panel of 3 people. The panel must be independent.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li><p>The admission authority will explain why they turned down your application.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You’ll be able to give your own reasons why your child should be admitted.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The appeals panel must decide if the school’s admission criteria were properly followed and are legal according to the <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/adminandfinance/schooladmissions/a00195/school-admissions-codes-and-regulations\" title=\"School Admissions Code\" rel=\"external\">School Admissions Code.</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the criteria are legal and were properly followed, the panel must decide if they were followed fairly and thoroughly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the criteria weren’t properly followed or are illegal, your appeal must be upheld.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If your appeal has not already been upheld, the panel will decide if your reasons for your child to be admitted outweigh the school’s reasons for not admitting another child.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The panel will send you and the admission authority their decision within 5 school days.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Complaining about the appeals process</h2>\n\n<p>The panel&rsquo;s decision can only be overturned by a court. If there&rsquo;s a change in your circumstances which could affect the decision, you may be able to apply to appeal again. If you think there were problems with the way your appeal was conducted, who to complain to depends on the type of school.</p>\n\n<h3>Maintained schools</h3>\n\n<p>Contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.lgo.org.uk\" title=\"Local Government Ombudsman\">Local Government Ombudsman.</a></p>\n\n<h3>Free schools and academies</h3>\n\n<p>Contact the Education Funding Agency.</p>\n\n<div class=\"contact\">\n<p><strong>Education Funding Agency</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#097;&#099;&#097;&#100;&#101;&#109;&#121;&#113;&#117;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#115;&#064;&#101;&#102;&#097;&#046;&#101;&#100;&#117;&#099;&#097;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#046;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#046;&#117;&#107;\">&#097;&#099;&#097;&#100;&#101;&#109;&#121;&#113;&#117;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#115;&#064;&#101;&#102;&#097;&#046;&#101;&#100;&#117;&#099;&#097;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#046;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#046;&#117;&#107;</a> <br />\n0370 000 2288</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"address\"><div class=\"adr org fn\"><p>\n\nEducation Funding Agency\n<br />Admission Appeal Complaints  \n<br />Academies Central Unit  \n<br />Education Funding Agency  \n<br />Earlsdon Park  \n<br />Butts Road  \n<br />Coventry  \n<br />CV1 3BH\n<br />\n</p></div></div>\n\n"}]},"updated_at":"2012-10-29T12:52:53+00:00","tags":[{"title":"School admissions and transport to school","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/education%2Fschool-admissions-transport.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Applying for a school place, home schooling and travel costs","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=education%2Fschool-admissions-transport","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/education/school-admissions-transport"},"parent":{"title":"Education and learning","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/education.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Get help if you&#39;re at school, planning to go on to further or higher education, looking for training or interested in a student or career development loan.","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=education","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/education"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/find-nursery-school-place.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/find-nursery-school-place","title":"Find a nursery school place","format":"local_transaction","details":{"need_id":"2089","business_proposition":false,"description":"Apply for a place in a nursery school for children under 5 through your local council"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:19:09+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/apply-for-primary-school-place.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-primary-school-place","title":"Apply for a primary school place","format":"local_transaction","details":{"need_id":"2090","business_proposition":false,"description":"Apply for a state primary school place through your local council "},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:24:26+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/apply-for-secondary-school-place.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-secondary-school-place","title":"Apply for a secondary school place","format":"local_transaction","details":{"need_id":"2091","business_proposition":false,"description":"Apply for a state secondary school place through your local council"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:16:22+00:00"}]},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/set-up-free-school.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/set-up-free-school","title":"Setting up a free school","format":"answer","details":{"need_id":"1618","business_proposition":false,"description":"If there is a need for a new school in your area, you can set up a free school - find out what you need to do and how to increase your chance of success","body":"\n<div class=\"summary\">\n<p>To set up a free school, you’ll need to apply through the Department for Education website.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>You can set up a <a href=\"/types-of-school/free-schools\" title=\"About free schools\">free school</a> as part of a group that can provide evidence of parental demand (eg a petition), such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>community or faith groups</li>\n  <li>parents</li>\n  <li>teachers</li>\n  <li>charities</li>\n  <li>businesses</li>\n  <li>universities</li>\n  <li>independent schools (private, fee-paying schools)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All applications to set up a free school must be approved by the Secretary of State for the Department for Education.
