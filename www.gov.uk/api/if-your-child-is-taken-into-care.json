Under the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/part/IV\" title=\"Children's Act 1989\">Children&rsquo;s Act 1989,</a> a council can apply for a care order if it believes a child is suffering or at risk of suffering significant harm. </p>\n\n<p>The court decides if the child can be taken into care. </p>\n\n<p>Care orders last until:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the child&rsquo;s 18th birthday</li>\n  <li>an order is made giving parental responsibility to another person - eg through adoption</li>\n  <li>the court lifts the order (this is called &lsquo;discharging&rsquo; the order)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>A child can be taken into care if they are under 18.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Making a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>If your child is in care and you&rsquo;re unhappy about their treatment, you can make a complaint.

This allows the council to place the child with suitable adopters.</p>\n\n<h2>Interim care orders</h2>\n\n<p>At the start of care proceedings, the council asks the family court to make a temporary court order, called an ‘interim care order’. </p>\n\n<p>If the court agrees, the council can take the child into care on a temporary basis. This can be for up to 8 weeks at first. After that, it can be renewed every 28 days.</p>\n\n<h2>Looking at the case</h2>\n\n<p>It can take up to a year for a court to decide what should happen to the child. Sometimes it can take even longer than this. </p>\n\n<p>During this time a social worker, an officer from the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (<abbr title=\"Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service\">Cafcass</abbr>) and other people will be trying to understand the reasons why the child may be at risk.
