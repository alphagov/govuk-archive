All <abbr title=\"Child Trust Fund\">CTF</abbr> providers offer stakeholder accounts.</p>\n\n<h2>Share accounts</h2>\n\n<p>These invest your child&rsquo;s money by buying shares in companies. The value can go up or down.</p>\n\n<h2>Savings accounts</h2>\n\n<p>These work in the same way as a bank or building society account.
