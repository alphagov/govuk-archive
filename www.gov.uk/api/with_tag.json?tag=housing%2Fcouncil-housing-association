You can bid online, or by phone or text.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Get the council’s decision.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Getting an offer</h2>\n<p>Normally you only have a short time to accept a housing offer.

These give you different rights and responsibilities.</p>\n\n<h2>Introductory tenancy</h2>\n<p>New council tenants may be offered an introductory tenancy. These usually last 12 months and are like a ‘trial’ period.</p>\n\n<p>You automatically become a secure or flexible tenant after 12 months, unless your council has either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>started action to evict you</li>\n  <li>extended your introductory tenancy for a further 6 months</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are limits to what you can do with an introductory tenancy.

You can be legally homeless if you&rsquo;re staying with friends or another family for a while. You don&rsquo;t have to be sleeping rough to be homeless.</p>\n\n<h2>If you&rsquo;re under 16</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re under 16 and having serious problems at home, contact Children&rsquo;s Services at your local council. They&rsquo;ll try and help you sort things out so you can stay at home. If living at home is too dangerous or impossible, they can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>arrange for you to live with another family member or adult, like a friend’s parent</li>\n  <li>find you emergency accommodation</li>\n  <li>look at other options including living with a <a href=\"/foster-carers\" title=\"Foster carers\">foster family</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>If you&rsquo;re 16 or 17</h2>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If you’re under 18, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to sign a tenancy contract or mortgage agreement.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re 16 or 17 and homeless, you&rsquo;ll usually be provided with accommodation by Children&rsquo;s Services at your local council. This is because you&rsquo;ll be considered a &lsquo;child in need&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Children&rsquo;s Services will also consider if there&rsquo;s any way you can return home or go and live with another relative. They can&rsquo;t force you to go back somewhere you don&rsquo;t feel safe.</p>\n\n<h3>What a &lsquo;child in need&rsquo; is</h3>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;re a &lsquo;child in need&rsquo; if you&rsquo;re under 18 and:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you&rsquo;re living with a violent person</li>\n  <li>you don&rsquo;t have money for food</li>\n  <li>you don&rsquo;t have anywhere to live</li>\n  <li>you have problems that affect your health or education (eg you&rsquo;re disabled)</li>\n  <li>your home is uninhabitable (eg there&rsquo;s been a fire or flood)</li>\n</ul>\n","alternative_title":""},"tags":[{"title":"Council housing and housing association","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/housing%2Fcouncil-housing-association.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Applying for housing, home ownership schemes and sheltered housing","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=housing%2Fcouncil-housing-association","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing/council-housing-association"},"parent":{"title":"Housing and local services","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/housing.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Your legal obligations and rights when renting, buying or owning a home, plus information about Council Tax, what to do if you're homeless and where to get help if you have a housing dispute.","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=housing","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing"},"parent":null}},{"title":"Repossessions, emergency housing and evictions","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/housing%2Frepossessions-evictions.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes evictions, emergency housing, repossession and squatters","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=housing%2Frepossessions-evictions","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing/repossessions-evictions"},"parent":{"title":"Housing and local services","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/housing.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Your legal obligations and rights when renting, buying or owning a home, plus information about Council Tax, what to do if you're homeless and where to get help if you have a housing dispute.","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=housing","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/council-housing.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/council-housing","title":"Council housing","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:25:05+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/squatting-law.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/squatting-law","title":"Squatting and the law","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:26:10+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/leaving-foster-or-local-authority-care.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/leaving-foster-or-local-authority-care","title":"Leaving foster or local authority care","format":"answer","updated_at":"2012-11-06T14:31:18+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/emergency-housing-if-homeless.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/emergency-housing-if-homeless","title":"Emergency housing if you're homeless","format":"answer","updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:24:20+00:00"}]}]}
