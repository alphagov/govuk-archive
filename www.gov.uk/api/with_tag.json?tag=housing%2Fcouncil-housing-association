You can bid online, or by phone or text.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Get the council’s decision.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Getting an offer</h2>\n<p>Normally you only have a short time to accept a housing offer. If you don’t accept it, you can usually stay on the waiting list (or bid for other properties), but you may be put lower down the list. </p>\n\n<p>If you keep rejecting offers, you may be taken off the list temporarily.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re not happy with your council’s decision, you can appeal.</p>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/council-housing/types-of-tenancy","slug":"types-of-tenancy","order":2,"title":"Types of tenancy","body":"<p>Your tenancy agreement is a legal document and tells you all the rules about living in your property.</p>\n\n<p>Different council tenants have different tenancies.

These usually last 12 months and are like a ‘trial’ period.</p>\n\n<p>You automatically become a secure or flexible tenant after 12 months, unless your council has either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>started action to evict you</li>\n  <li>extended your introductory tenancy for a further 6 months</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are limits to what you can do with an introductory tenancy.
