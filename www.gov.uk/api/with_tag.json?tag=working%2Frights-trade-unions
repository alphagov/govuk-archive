This includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>trespassing (trying to enter a building without permission)</li>\n  <li>making a noise nuisance</li>\n  <li>using threatening language or offensive material, libel or slander in leaflets, banners, placards, chants or speeches</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you break a court order banning you or your trade union from holding a picket, you could be open to further legal action (otherwise known as &lsquo;contempt of court&rsquo;).</p>\n\n<h2>Mass picketing</h2>\n<p>Police have special powers to stop a mass picket if they think there&rsquo;s a danger of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>serious public disorder (like a riot)</li>\n  <li>serious damage to property</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Code of Practice on picketing says usually there should be no more than 6 people outside an entrance to a workplace.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t stop picketing when told do so by police, you can be arrested.</p>\n\n<h2>Secondary picketing</h2>\n<p>You mustn&rsquo;t picket other companies whose employers aren&rsquo;t in a dispute with your union - this is called secondary picketing. For example, it&rsquo;s illegal to go to your employer&rsquo;s customers to convince them not to handle your employer&rsquo;s goods. </p>\n\n<h2>Flying pickets</h2>\n<p>Flying pickets are groups of striking workers that move from one workplace to another to picket them. Usually flying pickets are illegal - you can only join a picket line at your workplace. </p>\n\n<p>Trade union reps can be on picket lines at different workplaces if they&rsquo;re responsible for organising workers in those workplaces. </p>\n\n"}]},"tags":[{"title":"Your rights at work and trade unions","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working%2Frights-trade-unions.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes health and safety, accidents at work and joining a trade union","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working%2Frights-trade-unions","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/rights-trade-unions"},"parent":{"title":"Working, jobs and pensions","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes holidays and finding a job","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/employment-contracts-and-conditions.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/employment-contracts-and-conditions","title":"Employment contracts","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-11-22T17:04:46+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/dismissal.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/dismissal","title":"Dismissal: your rights","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-11-06T14:17:34+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/join-trade-union.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/join-trade-union","title":"Joining a trade union","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:17:57+00:00"}]},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/rights-of-trade-union-reps.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/rights-of-trade-union-reps","title":"The rights of trade union reps","format":"answer","updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:19:20+00:00","details":{"need_id":"2023","business_proposition":false,"description":"Rights to paid time off for union reps, shop stewards, health and safety or learning reps or other union officials ","language":"en","body":"\n<div class=\"summary\">\n<p>Trade union reps are entitled to paid time off to get training and do their work as reps (as shop stewards, health and safety or union learning reps or other trade union officials).</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Paid time off for trade union reps</h2>\n\n<p>Reps are entitled to reasonable paid time off to do their union work as long as the union is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>independent </li>\n  <li>officially recognised by the employer to represent union members in negotiations on things like pay and terms and conditions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Examples of trade union duties reps have the right to paid time off for are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>negotiating pay, terms and conditions</li>\n  <li>helping union members with disciplinary or grievance procedures including meetings to hear their cases</li>\n  <li>going with union members to meetings with their line manager to discuss flexible working requests </li>\n  <li>discussing issues that affect union members like redundancies or the sale of the business</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Union learning reps have the right to paid time off to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>analyse the learning or training needs of union members</li>\n  <li>give information and advice about learning or training </li>\n  <li>arrange or encourage learning or training</li>\n  <li>discuss their activities as a learning representative with their employer</li>\n  <li>train as a learning representative</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>When reps aren&rsquo;t entitled to paid time off</h2>\n<p>Reps aren&rsquo;t allowed paid time off to attend union meetings or go to meetings with union officials.
