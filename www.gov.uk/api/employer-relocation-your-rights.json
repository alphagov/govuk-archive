It means that employers can normally force their employees to move to places allowed by the clause, unless this is completely unreasonable. </p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong> It would be unreasonable to ask an employee to move to another country with only 1 day&rsquo;s notice.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Employees without a mobility clause in their contract can choose whether or not to move. </p>\n\n<h2>Redundancy</h2>\n\n<p>Employers can make their employees <a href=\"/redundant-your-rights\" title=\"Redundancy: your rights\">redundant</a> if they decide not to move. </p>\n\n<p>Employees may have a right to redundancy pay if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>they match the <a href=\"/redundant-your-rights\" title=\"Redundancy: your rights\">redundancy criteria</a> - eg they&rsquo;ve worked for the employer for a certain amount of time</li>\n  <li>they&rsquo;re not getting any compensation from their employer because they decided not to move</li>\n  <li>they haven’t ‘unreasonably’ refused an offer of suitable alternative work </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>‘Unreasonable’ could mean refusing to move even though the new location is nearby and the employee could drive or easily take public transport. </p>\n\n<p>However, it may be reasonable to say no if it involves a difficult journey or affects personal matters like children&rsquo;s education.</p>\n\n<h2>Compensation</h2>\n<p>Employers don&rsquo;t have to offer employees any compensation for relocating, unless it&rsquo;s specified in their contract. </p>\n\n<h2>Disputes</h2>\n\n<p>Employers and employees may have to <a href=\"/solve-workplace-dispute\" title=\"Solve a workplace dispute\">solve a dispute</a> over issues with relocation, eg if they think someone is being unreasonable and refuse them a redundancy payment.</p>\n\n<h2>If an employer is taken over</h2>\n\n<p>If an employer is taken over and the new owners want to relocate, employees&rsquo; rights are protected by certain regulations. These are known as TUPE - Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment.</p>\n\n<p>All employee&rsquo;s existing rights, including contractual rights and redundancy protection, stay the same. It makes no difference that it&rsquo;s a new owner that introduces the relocation.</p>\n"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:26:30+00:00","tags":[{"title":"Contracts of employment and working hours","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/employing-people%2Fcontracts.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes types of worker, employee rights, overtime and changes to contracts","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=employing-people%2Fcontracts","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/employing-people/contracts"},"parent":{"title":"Employing people","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/employing-people.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes pay, contracts and hiring","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=employing-people","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/employing-people"},"parent":null}},{"title":"Your contract and working hours","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working%2Fcontract-working-hours.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes employment status, workers' rights and changes to contracts","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working%2Fcontract-working-hours","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/contract-working-hours"},"parent":{"title":"Working, jobs and pensions","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes holidays and finding a job","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/employment-contracts-and-conditions.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/employment-contracts-and-conditions","title":"Employment contracts","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"352","business_proposition":true,"description":"A contract is an agreement between employee and employer setting out implied and explicit terms  and conditions - written statement of particulars, collective agreements"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:26:23+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/redundant-your-rights.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/redundant-your-rights","title":"Redundancy: your rights","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"147","business_proposition":false,"description":"If you're being made redundant from your job - rights, pay, notice periods and consultation"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:26:26+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/solve-workplace-dispute.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/solve-workplace-dispute","title":"Solve a workplace dispute","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"365","business_proposition":false,"description":"Grievances and disciplinary action at work can be solved by informal discussions, formal procedures, mediation, conciliation or arbitration"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:17:50+00:00"}]}
