In the first stage, interested suppliers are asked to fill out a questionnaire and a short-list is drawn up. In the second stage, the shortlisted suppliers are invited to respond to an Invitation to Tender (<abbr title=\"Invitation to Tender\">ITT</abbr>). The tenders are then evaluated and the contract awarded.</p>\n\n<h3>The competitive dialogue procedure</h3>\n\n<p>This procedure is used for more complex procurements. After a selection process, the buyer then negotiates with suppliers and invites chosen companies to put in a bid. Suppliers put in their tenders and the contract is awarded.</p>\n\n<h3>The negotiated procedure</h3>\n\n<p>In this procedure, the buyer enters into contract negotiations with one or more suppliers.</p>\n\n<h2>Framework agreements</h2>\n\n<p>If a public sector organisation knows they are likely to need particular goods or services, but are unsure about exactly what they&rsquo;ll need or when, they may decide to set up a group of approved suppliers that they can use when necessary. This is called a &lsquo;framework agreement&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>The organisation will invite potential suppliers to put themselves forward for the framework and choose the one(s) most able to do the work.
