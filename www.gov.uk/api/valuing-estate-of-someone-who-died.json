In Northern Ireland, gaming and wagering contracts aren&rsquo;t legally enforceable and aren&rsquo;t allowable for deductions.</p>\n\n<h2>Guarantee debts</h2>\n\n<p>These are promises to pay someone else&rsquo;s debt if they can&rsquo;t pay it themselves. If the loan hadn&rsquo;t been repaid when the person died, you may be able to make a deduction from the estate. This depends on the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances - if they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have no financial resources, you can deduct the whole amount of the loan</li>\n  <li>can repay part of the loan, you can deduct the amount they can&rsquo;t repay</li>\n  <li>can repay the whole loan, you can&rsquo;t deduct anything</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Funeral expenses</h2>\n\n<p>You can deduct these from the value of the estate, as well as expenses to cover things like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>flowers</li>\n  <li>refreshments for mourners</li>\n  <li>expenses paid by the executor or administrator when arranging the funeral</li>\n  <li>a headstone to mark the grave</li>\n</ul>\n\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/an-example","slug":"an-example","order":8,"title":"An example","body":"<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of how to value an estate for Inheritance Tax purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Robert died on 10 April 2011, leaving £1,000 to charity (exempt from Inheritance Tax) and the rest of his estate to his daughter. </p>\n\n<p>The value of his assets are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>house = £300,000</li>\n  <li>car = £7,500</li>\n  <li>household goods = £2,000</li>\n  <li>bank account = £19,000</li>\n  <li>shares = £30,000</li>\n  <li>Premium Bonds = £500</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Total value = £359,000</p>\n\n<p>The value of his debts are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>telephone bill = £55</li>\n  <li>electricity bill = £45</li>\n  <li>gas bill = £35</li>\n  <li>funeral expenses = £865</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Total debts to deduct = £1,000</p>\n\n<p>The net value of Robert&rsquo;s estate minus the charity donation of £1,000 is £357,000.</p>\n\n<p>You can now work out the amount of Inheritance Tax to pay:</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li><p>The Inheritance Tax threshold is £325,000, so you take this away from the value of the estate.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This leaves £32,000 that’s taxable at 40%.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>£32,000 x 40% = £12,800.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The amount of Inheritance Tax payable is £12,800.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are instructions on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payinghmrc/inheritance.htm\" title=\"how to pay Inheritance Tax\">how to pay Inheritance Tax</a> on the HM Revenue &amp;
