These days are called ‘keeping in touch days’. Keeping in touch days are optional, both the employee and employer need to agree to them. </p>\n\n<p>The type of work and pay employees get should be agreed before they come into work. The employee&rsquo;s right to maternity, adoption or additional paternity leave and pay isn&rsquo;t affected by taking keeping in touch days. </p>\n\n<h2>Terms and conditions protection</h2>\n\n<p>Normally, the employment terms and conditions are protected and employees are entitled to any pay rises and improvements in terms and conditions given during their leave.</p>\n\n<p>Pension contributions usually stop if a period of leave is unpaid. For example, unpaid periods of maternity leave or parental leave. </p>\n\n<p>Employees continue to build up holiday entitlement and can take any holiday they&rsquo;ve accrued (built up) before or after their leave.</p>\n\n<h2>Returning to work</h2>\n\n<p>Employees have the right to return to their job if they take:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Ordinary Maternity or Ordinary Adoption leave </li>\n  <li>Ordinary Paternity Leave </li>\n  <li>Additional Paternity Leave </li>\n  <li>4 weeks or less of parental leave </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The rules are different if the employee takes: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Additional Maternity or Additional Adoption Leave </li>\n  <li>more than 4 weeks of parental leave  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this situation, employees have the right to their job or a similar job (if it&rsquo;s not possible to give them their old job). Similar means the job has the same or better terms and conditions. If the employee unreasonably refuses to take the similar job the employer can take this as their resignation. </p>\n\n<h2>Redundancy</h2>\n\n<p>While an employee is on maternity, adoption, paternity or parental leave they have the: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>same <a href=\"/redundant-your-rights\" title=\"Redundancy: your rights\">redundancy rights</a> as their colleagues</li>\n  <li>right to be offered any suitable alternative job if they&rsquo;re selected for redundancy (even if other colleagues are more suitable for the role) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An employee can only be made redundant if the employer can clearly justify doing it - eg a part of the business closes and everyone in that section is made redundant. There are other <a href=\"/making-staff-redundant\" title=\"Employer guide: making staff redundant\">rules for employers</a> when making staff redundant. </p>\n"},"updated_at":"2012-10-13T19:29:25+00:00","tags":[{"title":"Statutory leave and time off","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/employing-people%2Ftime-off.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes maternity and paternity leave, holiday entitlement and sick pay","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=employing-people%2Ftime-off","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/employing-people/time-off"},"parent":{"title":"Employing people","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/employing-people.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes pay, contracts and hiring","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=employing-people","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/employing-people"},"parent":null}},{"title":"Holidays, time off, sick leave, maternity and paternity leave","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working%2Ftime-off.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes career breaks and the holiday entitlement calculator","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working%2Ftime-off","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/time-off"},"parent":{"title":"Working, jobs and pensions","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes holidays and finding a job","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working"},"parent":null}},{"title":"Business Link","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/businesslink.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":null,"type":"legacy_source"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=businesslink","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/businesslink"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/employment-contracts-and-conditions.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/employment-contracts-and-conditions","title":"Employment contracts","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"352","business_proposition":true},"updated_at":"2012-10-13T19:30:54+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/solve-workplace-dispute.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/solve-workplace-dispute","title":"Solve a workplace dispute","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"365","business_proposition":false},"updated_at":"2012-10-13T19:31:17+00:00"}]}
