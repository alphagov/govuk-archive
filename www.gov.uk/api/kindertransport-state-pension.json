However, for many Kindertransportees in the UK their new German state pension was affected by their UK insurance record for years before 1948.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2008, you can have these years removed if this will make you eligible for a higher German state pension. </p>\n\n<h2>Eligibility</h2>\n\n<p>You might be eligible if all of these apply:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you came to the UK before June 1940 as part of the Kindertransport </li>\n  <li>you paid into UK State Pension insurance before 1948 </li>\n  <li>your entitlement to a German state pension was reduced or lost by the UK State Pension insurance paid before 6 April 1948 </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you think you may be eligible, you can ask the International Pension Centre to amend your UK State Pension insurance. This will not affect the UK <a href=\"/state-pension\" title=\"basic State Pension\">State Pension</a> you get. </p>\n\n<p>If the Kindertransportee has died, surviving wives or husbands might also be able to benefit.
