Only agree to payments you can manage. You may also qualify for <a href=\"/council-tax-benefit\" title=\"Council Tax Benefit\">Council Tax Benefit</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>If you still don&rsquo;t pay</h2>\n<p>If you can’t come to a payment arrangement (or if you make arrangements to pay but don’t), your council can ask the Magistrates’ Court for a ‘Liability Order’. This is a demand for you to pay the full amount you owe, plus costs.</p>\n\n<p>You have the right to attend the court and say why you think you shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay. Even if you decide not to attend court, you should speak to the council or, if you prefer, your local <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/\" title=\"Citizens Advice\">Citizens Advice.</a> The council will try to come to a reasonable arrangement with you for payment – but they can’t do that unless you contact them.</p>\n\n<h2>If you ignore the court order</h2>\n<p>Your council can take action to get the money you owe from you.</p>\n\n<h3>Deductions from wages</h3>\n<p>Your council can order your employer to deduct a regular amount from your wages toward your unpaid Council Tax. If this means you&rsquo;re struggling to pay your bills, you can ask your council if they&rsquo;re willing to accept smaller payments.</p>\n\n<h3>Deductions from benefits</h3>\n<p>Your council may be able to apply to have money deducted from your benefits, like Jobseekers’ Allowance, Income Support or Pension Credit.</p>\n\n<h3>Bailiffs</h3>\n<p>Your council can send bailiffs to your home to seize property to sell. Your council must write to you 2 weeks before the bailiff’s first visit saying how much you owe.</p>\n\n<p>You can contact the council and the bailiffs and try to agree a payment plan. However, if the bailiffs visit you their costs could be added to your bill.</p>\n\n<h3>Prison</h3>\n<p>If your council has tried using bailiffs but your bill still isn&rsquo;t paid, they can apply to the Magistrates’ Court for a warrant to send you to prison. </p>\n\n<p>The court must hold an enquiry with you present. This is to find out if you can afford to pay the bill. If the court doesn&rsquo;t think you have a valid reason for not paying, it can send you to prison for up to 3 months.</p>\n\n<p>The court may decide to postpone imprisonment on certain conditions, like you agreeing to repay the debt over time. The court can also cancel all or part of the debt. </p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>The longer you ignore a debt problem, the worse the situation becomes.</p>\n</div>\n\n","alternative_title":""},"tags":[{"title":"Council Tax","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/housing%2Fcouncil-tax.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes bands, arrears, appeals and Council Tax Benefit","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=housing%2Fcouncil-tax","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing/council-tax"},"parent":{"title":"Housing and local services","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/housing.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Your legal obligations and rights when renting, buying or owning a home, plus information about Council Tax, what to do if you're homeless and where to get help if you have a housing dispute.","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=housing","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/council-tax-benefit.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/council-tax-benefit","title":"Council Tax Benefit","format":"programme","updated_at":"2012-12-14T13:37:26+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/council-tax.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/council-tax","title":"Council Tax","format":"guide","updated_at":"2013-01-06T20:23:32+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/council-tax-appeals.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/council-tax-appeals","title":"Council Tax appeals","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:26:29+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/your-rights-bailiffs.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/your-rights-bailiffs","title":"Bailiff powers when they visit your home","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:15:33+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/options-for-paying-off-your-debts.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/options-for-paying-off-your-debts","title":"Options for paying off your debts","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-11-06T09:32:51+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/pay-council-tax.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/pay-council-tax","title":"Pay your Council Tax","format":"local_transaction","updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:16:33+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/apply-for-council-tax-discount.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-council-tax-discount","title":"Apply for a Council Tax discount","format":"local_transaction","updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:19:15+00:00"}]}
