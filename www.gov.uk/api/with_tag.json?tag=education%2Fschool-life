The importance of stable relationships (eg marriage) and family life are emphasised. <abbr title=\"Sex and relationship education\">SRE</abbr> doesn&rsquo;t promote early sexual activity and it doesn&rsquo;t promote any particular sexual orientation.</p>\n\n<p>Some elements of sex and relationship education are mandatory - these are part of the national curriculum for science. Parents can withdraw their children from all other parts of sex and relationship education if they want.</p>\n\n<h2>Religious education</h2>\n\n<p>Schools also have to teach religious education but parents can withdraw their children for all or part of the lessons. Local councils are responsible for deciding on a syllabus.</p>\n\n"}]},"updated_at":"2012-11-09T13:44:57+00:00","tags":[{"title":"School life","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/education%2Fschool-life.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Help with school costs, the curriculum and school attendance","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=education%2Fschool-life","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/education/school-life"},"parent":{"title":"Education and learning","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/education.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Get help if you&#39;re at school, planning to go on to further or higher education, looking for training or interested in a student or career development loan.","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=education","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/education"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/school-term-holiday-dates.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/school-term-holiday-dates","title":"School term and holiday dates","format":"local_transaction","details":{"need_id":"122","business_proposition":false,"description":"Find your child's school term, half term and holiday dates on your local council's website"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:17:29+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/types-of-school.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school","title":"Types of school ","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"1320","business_proposition":false,"description":"Types of school and how they're run - community schools, academies, free schools"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:25:56+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/home-schooling-information-council.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/home-schooling-information-council","title":"Home schooling - get information from your council","format":"local_transaction","details":{"need_id":"2087","business_proposition":false,"description":"Your responsibilities with your local council if you want to educate your child at home - sometimes called home schooling"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:15:58+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/apply-for-primary-school-place.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-primary-school-place","title":"Apply for a primary school place","format":"local_transaction","details":{"need_id":"2090","business_proposition":false,"description":"Apply for a state primary school place through your local council "},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:24:26+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/apply-for-secondary-school-place.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-secondary-school-place","title":"Apply for a secondary school place","format":"local_transaction","details":{"need_id":"2091","business_proposition":false,"description":"Apply for a state secondary school place through your local council"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:16:22+00:00"}]}]}
