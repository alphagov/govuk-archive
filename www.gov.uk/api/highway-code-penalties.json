Certain non-motoring offences, e.g. failure to rectify vehicle defects, can also attract penalty points. The court <strong>MUST</strong> order points to be endorsed on the licence according to the fixed number or the range set by Parliament. The accumulation of penalty points acts as a warning to drivers and motorcyclists that they risk disqualification if further offences are committed.<br />\n<strong>Law RTOA sects 44 &amp; 45</strong></p>\n\n<p>A driver or motorcyclist who accumulates 12 or more penalty points within a three-year period <strong>MUST</strong> be disqualified. This will be for a minimum period of six months, or longer if the driver or motorcyclist has previously been disqualified.<br />\n<strong>Law RTOA sect 35</strong></p>\n\n<p>For every offence which carries penalty points the court has a discretionary power to order the licence holder to be disqualified. This may be for any period the court thinks fit, but will usually be between a week and a few months.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of serious offences, such as dangerous driving and drink-driving, the court <strong>MUST</strong> order disqualification. The minimum period is 12 months, but for repeat offenders or where the alcohol level is high, it may be longer. For example, a second drink-drive offence in the space of 10 years will result in a minimum of three years’ disqualification. <br />\n<strong>Law RTOA sect 34</strong></p>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/highway-code-penalties/penalty-table","slug":"penalty-table","order":3,"title":"Penalty table","body":"<p>Please note the penalties listed under &lsquo;Imprisonment&rsquo;, &lsquo;Fine&rsquo; and &lsquo;Disqualification&rsquo; are maximum penalties.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><strong>Offence</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Imprisonment</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Fine</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Disqualification</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Penalty Points</strong></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>*Causing death by dangerous driving</td>\n      <td>14 years</td>\n      <td>Unlimited</td>\n      <td>Obligatory - 2 years minimum</td>\n      <td>3-11 (if exceptionally not disqualified)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>*Dangerous driving</td>\n      <td>2 years</td>\n      <td>Unlimited</td>\n      <td>Obligatory</td>\n      <td>3-11 (if exceptionally not disqualified)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>*Causing death by careless driving under the influence of drink or drugs</td>\n      <td>14 years</td>\n      <td>Unlimited</td>\n      <td>Obligatory - 2 years minimum</td>\n      <td>3-11 (if exceptionally not disqualified)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Careless and inconsiderate driving</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>£5,000</td>\n      <td>Discretionary</td>\n      <td>3-9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Driving while unfit through drink or drugs or with excess alcohol: or failing to provide a specimen for analysis</td>\n      <td>6 months</td>\n      <td>£5,000</td>\n      <td>Obligatory</td>\n      <td>3-11 (if exceptionally not disqualified)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Failing to stop after an accident or failing to report an accident</td>\n      <td>6 months</td>\n      <td>£5,000</td>\n      <td>Discretionary</td>\n      <td>5-10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Driving while disqualified</td>\n      <td>6 months (12 months in Scotland)</td>\n      <td>£5,000</td>\n      <td>Discretionary</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Driving after refusal or revocation of licence on medical grounds</td>\n      <td>6 months</td>\n      <td>£5,000</td>\n      <td>Discretionary</td>\n      <td>3-6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Driving without insurance</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>LGV £5,000 PCV £5,000 Other £2,500</td>\n      <td>Obligatory if offence committed within 3 years of a previous conviction for the same offence - 6 months min otherwise discretionary</td>\n      <td>3 in each case</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Failure to have proper control of vehicle or full view of the road and traffic ahead, or using a hand-held mobile phone when driving</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>£1,000 (£2,500 for PCV or goods vehicle)</td>\n      <td>Discretionary</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>£1,000</td>\n      <td>Discretionary</td>\n      <td>3-6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Speeding</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>£1,000 (£2,500 for motorway offences)</td>\n      <td>Discretionary</td>\n      <td>3-6 or 3 (fixed penalty)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Traffic light offences</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>£1,000</td>\n      <td>Discretionary</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>No MOT certificate</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>£1,000</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Seat belt offences</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>£500</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Dangerous cycling</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>£1,000</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Careless cycling</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>£1,000</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Cycling on pavement</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>£500</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Failing to identify driver of vehicle</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>£1,000</td>\n      <td>Discretionary</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Where a court disqualifies a person on conviction for one of these offences, it must order an extended retest.
