You must give your tenants at least 24 hours&rsquo; notice, although immediate access may be possible in emergencies. Your tenants have the right to stay in the property during the repairs.</p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;re normally responsible for repairs to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the structure of your property</li>\n  <li>basins, sinks, baths and other sanitary fittings</li>\n  <li>heating and hot water systems</li>\n  <li>any damage you cause through attempting repairs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If your property is seriously damaged by a fire, flood or other similar incident, you don&rsquo;t have to rebuild or renovate it. However, if you do, you can&rsquo;t charge your tenants for any repairs made.</p>\n\n<h2>Common areas</h2>\n\n<p>If you own a block of flats, you will usually be responsible for repairing common areas, like staircases. Councils can ask landlords to fix problems in common areas, or to repair a tenant&rsquo;s flat that has been damaged by another tenant.</p>\n\n<h2>What happens if repairs aren&rsquo;t done properly</h2>\n\n<p>If you refuse to carry out repairs, tenants can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>start a claim in the small claims court for repairs under £5,000</li>\n  <li>in some circumstances, carry out the repairs themselves and deduct the cost from their rent</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you don’t make repairs to remove hazards, your tenants can ask the local council to inspect the property under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System and to take any action that is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>If the council finds serious hazards, it must take enforcement action to make sure the hazard is removed.</p>\n\n<h2>If the property is temporarily unfit to live in</h2>\n\n<p>You can ask tenants to move out during major repairs.
