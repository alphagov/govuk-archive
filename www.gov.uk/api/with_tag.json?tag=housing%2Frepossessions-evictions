If you don’t make the payments, your landlord can ask the court to evict you. </p>\n\n<h3>Money order</h3>\n<p>This means you have to pay the landlord the amount set out in the order. If you don’t make the payments, action could be taken by the courts to recover the money, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>deducting money from your wages or bank account</li>\n  <li>sending bailiffs to take away things you own</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you get into rent arrears after a money order has been made, your landlord can go to court again and ask for a possession order.</p>\n\n<h3>Possession orders with a money judgment</h3>\n<p>A judge can add a money judgment to any of the possession orders. This means you owe a specific amount of money, usually made up of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your rent arrears</li>\n  <li>court fees</li>\n  <li>your landlord’s legal costs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The money judgment won’t apply if you pay your arrears and the amount set out in a suspended possession order.</p>\n\n<p>However, the money judgment will apply if you don’t pay the amount set out in the suspended possession order that’s linked to the judgment.
