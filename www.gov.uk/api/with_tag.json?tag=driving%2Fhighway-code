Stop anyone from smoking.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Get help</h2>\n<p>Try to get the assistance of bystanders. Get someone to call the appropriate emergency services as soon as possible. They will need to know the exact location of the incident and the number of vehicles involved.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Help those involved</h2>\n<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> move casualties still in vehicles unless further danger is threatened.<br />\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> remove a motorcyclist’s helmet unless it is essential. Remember the casualty may be suffering from shock.<br />\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> give them anything to eat or drink.<br />\n<strong>DO</strong> try to make them warm and as comfortable as you can, but avoid unnecessary movement.<br />\n<strong>DO</strong> give reassurance confidently and try not to leave them alone or let them wander into the path of other traffic.</p>\n\n<h2>4.  Provide emergency care</h2>\n<p>Remember the letters DR A B C:  </p>\n\n<p><strong>D - Danger</strong> - check that you are not in danger.<br />\n<strong>R - Response</strong> - try to get a response by asking questions and gently shaking their shoulders.<br />\n<strong>A - Airway</strong> - the airway should be clear and kept open. Place one hand on the forehead, two fingers under the chin and gently tilt the head back.<br />\n<strong>B - Breathing</strong> - normal breathing should be established. Once the airway is open check breathing for up to 10 seconds.<br />\n<strong>C - Compressions</strong> - if they are not breathing normally compressions should be administered to maintain circulation; place two hands in the centre of the chest and press down 4-5 cms at a rate of 100/minute. You may only need one hand for a child. Give 30 chest compressions. Then tilt the head back gently, pinch the casualty’s nostrils together and place your mouth over theirs. Give two breaths, each lasting one second (use gentle breaths for a small child).</p>\n\n<h3>Bleeding</h3>\n<p>First check for anything that may be in the wound, such as glass. If there is nothing embedded apply firm pressure over the wound. Take care not to press on the object - build up padding on either side of it. Fasten a pad to the wound with a bandage or length of cloth. Use the cleanest material available. If a limb is bleeding, but not broken, raise it above the level of the heart to reduce the flow of blood. Any restriction of blood circulation for more than a short time could cause long-term injuries.</p>\n\n<h3>Burns</h3>\n<p>Try to cool the burn by dousing it with clean, cold water or similar non-toxic liquid for at least 10 minutes. Do not try to remove anything sticking to the burn.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Be prepared</h2>\n<p>Always carry a first aid kit.

Many large vehicles may be fitted with speed limiting devices which will restrict speed to 56 mph (90 km/h) even on a motorway.</p>\n\n<h2>223</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Buses, coaches and trams.</strong> Give priority to these vehicles when you can do so safely, especially when they signal to pull away from stops. Look out for people getting off a bus or tram and crossing the road.</p>\n\n<h2>224</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Electric vehicles.</strong> Be careful of electric vehicles such as milk floats and trams. Trams move quickly but silently and cannot steer to avoid you.</p>\n\n<h2>225</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles with flashing amber beacons.</strong> These warn of a slow-moving or stationary vehicle (such as a Traffic Officer vehicle, salt spreader, snow plough or recovery vehicle) or abnormal loads, so approach with caution.

Take extra care where trams run along the road. You should avoid driving directly on top of the rails and should take care where trams leave the main carriageway to enter the reserved route, to ensure you do not follow them. The width taken up by trams is often shown by tram lanes marked by white lines, yellow dots or by a different type of road surface. Diamond-shaped signs and white light signals give instructions to tram drivers only.<br />\n<strong>Law RTRA sects 5 &amp; 8</strong></p>\n\n<h2>301</h2>\n\n<p>Take extra care where the track crosses from one side of the road to the other and where the road narrows and the tracks come close to the kerb. Tram drivers usually have their own traffic signals and may be permitted to move when you are not. Always give way to trams. Do not try to race or overtake them or pass them on the inside, unless they are at tram stops or stopped by tram signals and there is a designated tram lane for you to pass.</p>\n\n<h2>302</h2>\n\n<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> park your vehicle where it would get in the way of trams or where it would force other drivers to do so. Do not stop on any part of a tram track, except in a designated bay where this has been provided alongside and clear of the track.

Remember that a tram cannot steer round an obstruction.<br />\n<strong>Law RTRA sects 5 &amp; 8</strong></p>\n\n<h2>303</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Tram stops.</strong> Where the tram stops at a platform, either in the middle or at the side of the road, you <strong>MUST</strong> follow the route shown by the road signs and markings. At stops without platforms you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive between a tram and the left-hand kerb when a tram has stopped to pick up passengers. If there is no alternative route signed, do not overtake the tram - wait until it moves off.  <br />\n<strong>Law RTRA sects 5 &amp; 8</strong></p>\n\n<h2>304</h2>\n\n<p>Look out for pedestrians, especially children, running to catch a tram approaching a stop.</p>\n\n<h2>305</h2>\n\n<p>Always give priority to trams, especially when they signal to pull away from stops, unless it would be unsafe to do so. Remember that they may be carrying large numbers of standing passengers who could be injured if the tram had to make an emergency stop. Look out for people getting off a bus or tram and crossing the road. </p>\n\n<h2>306</h2>\n\n<p>All road users, but particularly cyclists and motorcyclists, should take extra care when driving or riding close to or crossing the tracks, especially if the rails are wet. You should take particular care when crossing the rails at shallow angles, on bends and at junctions. It is safest to cross the tracks directly at right angles. Other road users should be aware that cyclists and motorcyclists may need more space to cross the tracks safely.</p>\n\n<h2>307</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Overhead electric lines.</strong> Tramway overhead wires are normally 5.8 metres above any carriageway, but can be lower. You should ensure that you have sufficient clearance between the wire and your vehicle (including any load you are carrying) before driving under an overhead wire. Drivers of vehicles with extending cranes, booms, tipping apparatus or other types of variable height equipment should ensure that the equipment is fully lowered. Where overhead wires are set lower than 5.8 metres, these will be indicated by height clearance markings - similar to ‘low bridge’ signs. The height clearances on these plates should be carefully noted and observed. If you are in any doubt as to whether your vehicle will pass safely under the wires, you should always contact the local police or the tramway operator. Never take a chance as this can be extremely hazardous.</p>\n"}]},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:24:38+00:00","tags":[{"title":"The Highway Code","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/driving%2Fhighway-code.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes road signs and rules for vehicles and cyclists","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=driving%2Fhighway-code","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving/highway-code"},"parent":{"title":"Driving, transport, and travel","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/driving.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Book your driving test or get a tax disc online, find out the legal requirements for buying, owning, importing or scrapping a car or motorcycle, and read about your rights and responsibilities as a driver.","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=driving","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/highway-code.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/highway-code","title":"The Highway Code","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"2466","business_proposition":false,"description":"Contents page for the Highway Code, which applies to England, Scotland and Wales and is essential reading for everyone"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:17:30+00:00"}]},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/rules-about-animals-47-to-58.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/rules-about-animals-47-to-58","title":"Rules about animals (47 to 58)","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"2469","business_proposition":false,"description":"The Highway Code: rules about animals (47 to 58)","alternative_title":"The Highway Code: rules 47 to 58","video_summary":"","video_url":"","parts":[{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/rules-about-animals-47-to-58/horsedrawn-vehicles-47-to-48","slug":"horsedrawn-vehicles-47-to-48","order":1,"title":"Horse-drawn vehicles (47 to 48)","body":"<h2>47</h2>\n<p>Horse-drawn vehicles used on the highway should be operated and maintained in accordance with standards set out in the Department for Transport’s Code of Practice for Horse-Drawn Vehicles.

You then won’t have to pay any road tax for that vehicle for a period of 12 months. You need to send a further declaration after that period if the vehicle is still off the public road.

Children should be taught the Code and should not be allowed out alone until they can understand and use it properly. The age when they can do this is different for each child. Many children cannot judge how fast vehicles are going or how far away they are. Children learn by example, so parents and carers should always use the Code in full when out with their children. They are responsible for deciding at what age children can use it safely by themselves.</p>\n\n<p>A.  <strong>First find a safe place to cross</strong> and where there is space to reach the pavement on the other side. Where there is a crossing nearby, use it. It is safer to cross using a subway, a footbridge, an island, a zebra, pelican, toucan or puffin crossing, or where there is a crossing point controlled by a police officer, a school crossing patrol or a traffic warden. Otherwise choose a place where you can see clearly in all directions. Try to avoid crossing between parked cars (see <a href=\"/rules-pedestrians-1-to-35/crossing-the-road-7-to-17\" title=\"Crossing the road 7-17\">Rule 14</a>), on a blind bend, or close to the brow of a hill. Move to a space where drivers and riders can see you clearly. Do not cross the road diagonally.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/static/hc/hc_rule_7_look_all_around_and_listen_for_traffic_before_crossing.jpg\" width=\"315\" height=\"250\" alt=\"Highway Code - Rule 7 Look All Around And Listen For Traffic Before Crossing\" /></p>\n\n<p>B.  <strong>Stop just before you get to the kerb,</strong> where you can see if anything is coming. Do not get too close to the traffic. If there’s no pavement, keep back from the edge of the road but make sure you can still see approaching traffic.</p>\n\n<p>C.  <strong>Look all around for traffic and listen.</strong> Traffic could come from any direction. Listen as well, because you can sometimes hear traffic before you see it.</p>\n\n<p>D.  <strong>If traffic is coming, let it pass.</strong> Look all around again and listen. Do not cross until there is a safe gap in the traffic and you are certain that there is plenty of time. Remember, even if traffic is a long way off, it may be approaching very quickly.</p>\n\n<p>E.  <strong>When it is safe, go straight across the road – do not run.</strong> Keep looking and listening for traffic while you cross, in case there is any traffic you did not see, or in case other traffic appears suddenly. Look out for cyclists and motorcyclists travelling between lanes of traffic. Do not walk diagonally across the road.</p>\n\n<h2>8</h2>\n<p><strong>At a junction.</strong> When crossing the road, look out for traffic turning into the road, especially from behind you. If you have started crossing and traffic wants to turn into the road, you have priority and they should give way (see <a href=\"/using-the-road-159-to-203/road-junctions-170-to-183\" title=\"Road junctions (170 to 183)\">Rule 170</a>).</p>\n\n<h2>9</h2>\n<p><strong>Pedestrian Safety Barriers.</strong> Where there are barriers, cross the road only at the gaps provided for pedestrians. Do not climb over the barriers or walk between them and the road.</p>\n\n<h2>10</h2>\n<p><strong>Tactile paving.</strong> Raised surfaces that can be felt underfoot provide warning and guidance to blind or partially sighted people. The most common surfaces are a series of raised studs, which are used at crossing points with a dropped kerb, or a series of rounded raised bars which are used at level crossings, at the top and bottom of steps and at some other hazards.</p>\n\n<h2>11</h2>\n<p><strong>One-way streets.</strong> Check which way the traffic is moving. Do not cross until it is safe to do so without stopping. Bus and cycle lanes may operate in the opposite direction to the rest of the traffic.</p>\n\n<h2>12</h2>\n<p><strong>Bus and cycle lanes.</strong> Take care when crossing these lanes as traffic may be moving faster than in the other lanes, or against the flow of traffic.</p>\n\n<h2>13</h2>\n<p><strong>Routes shared with cyclists.</strong> Some cycle tracks run alongside footpaths or pavements, using a segregating feature to separate cyclists from people on foot. Segregated routes may also incorporate short lengths of tactile paving to help visually impaired people stay on the correct side. On the pedestrian side this will comprise a series of flat-topped bars running across the direction of travel (ladder pattern). On the cyclist side the same bars are orientated in the direction of travel (tramline pattern). Not all routes which are shared with cyclists are segregated. Take extra care where this is so (see <a href=\"/rules-for-cyclists-59-to-82/overview-59-to-71\" title=\"Rules for cyclists: Overview (59 to 71)\">Rule 62</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>14</h2>\n<p><strong>Parked vehicles.</strong> If you have to cross between parked vehicles, use the outside edges of the vehicles as if they were the kerb. Stop there and make sure you can see all around and that the traffic can see you. Make sure there is a gap between any parked vehicles on the other side, so you can reach the pavement. Never cross the road in front of, or behind, any vehicle with its engine running, especially a large vehicle, as the driver may not be able to see you.</p>\n\n<h2>15</h2>\n<p><strong>Reversing vehicles.</strong> Never cross behind a vehicle which is reversing, showing white reversing lights or sounding a warning.</p>\n\n<h2>16</h2>\n<p><strong>Moving vehicles.</strong> You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> get onto or hold onto a moving vehicle.<br />\n<strong>Law RTA 1988 sect 26</strong></p>\n\n<h2>17</h2>\n<p><strong>At night.</strong> Wear something reflective to make it easier for others to see you (see <a href=\"/rules-pedestrians-1-to-35\" title=\"Rules for pedestrians: General guidance\">Rule 3</a>). If there is no pedestrian crossing nearby, cross the road near a street light so that traffic can see you more easily.</p>\n\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/rules-pedestrians-1-to-35/crossings-18-to-30","slug":"crossings-18-to-30","order":3,"title":"Crossings (18 to 30)","body":"<h2>18</h2>\n<p><strong>At all crossings.</strong> When using any type of crossing you should</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>always check that the traffic has stopped before you start to cross or push a pram onto a crossing</li>\n  <li>always cross between the studs or over the zebra markings.

The Highway Code is essential reading for everyone. </p>\n\n<p>The most vulnerable road users are pedestrians, particularly children, older or disabled people, cyclists, motorcyclists and horse riders. It is important that all road users are aware of The Code and are considerate towards each other. This applies to pedestrians as much as to drivers and riders.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the rules in the Code are legal requirements, and if you disobey these rules you are committing a criminal offence. You may be fined, given penalty points on your licence or be disqualified from driving. In the most serious cases you may be sent to prison. Such rules are identified by the use of the words <strong>‘MUST/MUST NOT’</strong>. In addition, the rule includes an abbreviated reference to the legislation which creates the offence. See an <a href=\"/using-the-road-159-to-203/the-road-user-and-the-law\" title=\"The road user and the law\">explanation of the abbreviations.</a></p>\n\n<p>Although failure to comply with the other rules of the Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts (see <a href=\"/using-the-road-159-to-203/the-road-user-and-the-law\" title=\"The road user and the law\">The road user and the law</a> to establish liability. This includes rules which use advisory wording such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing and applying the rules contained in The Highway Code could significantly reduce road casualties. Cutting the number of deaths and injuries that occur on our roads every day is a responsibility we all share. The Highway Code can help us discharge that responsibility.

Tyres should also be free from certain cuts and other defects.\nCars, light vans and light trailers <strong>MUST</strong> have a tread depth of at least \n1.6 mm across the central three-quarters of the breadth of the tread and around the entire circumference.\nMotorcycles, large vehicles and passenger-carrying vehicles MUST have a tread depth of at least 1 mm across three-quarters of the breadth of the tread and in a continuous band around the entire circumference.\nMopeds should have visible tread.\nBe aware that some vehicle defects can attract penalty points.<br />\n<strong>Law CUR reg 27</strong></p>\n\n<p>If a tyre bursts while you are driving, try to keep control of your vehicle. Grip the steering wheel firmly and allow the vehicle to roll to a stop at the side of the road.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a flat tyre, stop as soon as it is safe to do so. Only change the tyre if you can do so without putting yourself or others at risk – otherwise call a breakdown service.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tyre pressures.</strong> Check weekly. Do this before your journey, when tyres are cold. Warm or hot tyres may give a misleading reading.</p>\n\n<p>Your brakes and steering will be adversely affected by under-inflated or over-inflated tyres. Excessive or uneven tyre wear may be caused by faults in the braking or suspension systems, or wheels which are out of alignment. Have these faults corrected as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fluid levels.</strong> Check the fluid levels in your vehicle at least weekly. Low brake fluid may result in brake failure and a crash.  Make sure you recognise the low fluid warning lights if your vehicle has them fitted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Before winter.</strong> Ensure that the battery is well maintained and that there are appropriate anti-freeze agents in your radiator and windscreen bottle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other problems.</strong> If your vehicle</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>pulls to one side when braking, it is most likely to be a brake fault or incorrectly inflated tyres.

Only then remove the coolant filler cap and add water or other coolant.</p>\n\n<p>If your vehicle catches fire, get the occupants out of the vehicle quickly and to a safe place. Do not attempt to extinguish a fire in the engine compartment, as opening the bonnet will make the fire flare. Call the fire brigade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Petrol stations/fuel tank/fuel leaks.</strong> Ensure that, when filling up your vehicle’s tank or any fuel cans you are carrying, you do not spill fuel on the forecourt. Any spilled fuel should be immediately reported to the petrol station attendant. Diesel spillage is dangerous to other road users, particularly motorcyclists, as it will significantly reduce the level of grip between the tyres and road surface. Double-check for fuel leaks and make sure that\n- you do not overfill your fuel tank\n- the fuel cap is fastened securely\n- the seal in the cap is not torn, perished or missing\n- there is no visual damage to the cap or the fuel tank</p>\n\n<p>Emergency fuel caps, if fitted, should form a good seal.</p>\n\n<p>Never smoke, or use a mobile phone, on the forecourt of petrol stations as these are major fire risks and could cause an explosion.</p>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-maintenance-safety-security/vehicle-security","slug":"vehicle-security","order":2,"title":"Vehicle security","body":"<p>When you leave your vehicle you should</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>remove the ignition key and engage the steering lock  </li>\n  <li>lock the car, even if you only leave it for a few minutes  </li>\n  <li>close the windows completely  </li>\n  <li>never leave children or pets in an unventilated car  </li>\n  <li>take all contents with you, or lock them in the boot.
