Customs (<abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After the end of your company&rsquo;s first year, your reporting dates will normally align when you send 2 Company Tax Returns to <abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll then be able to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>put together one set of <a href=\"/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company/prepare-annual-accounts\" title=\"Limited company annual accounts and tax returns\">statutory accounts</a> each year</li>\n  <li>send your company&rsquo;s accounts and Company Tax Returns <a href=\"/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company/file-your-accounts-and-company-tax-return\" title=\"Sending accounts and Company Tax Returns\">in one transaction</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Why you get different reporting dates</h2>\n\n<p>Companies House gives your company an &lsquo;accounting reference date&rsquo; - this is when they expect your company&rsquo;s year end to be. </p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s the last calendar day of the month your company was set up (incorporated) - eg if your company was set up on 12 May, its first accounting reference date will be 31 May the following year. So your company&rsquo;s first accounts for Companies House will often be for a period of longer than 12 months.</p>\n\n<p>For your Company Tax Return and Corporation Tax, your company has an &lsquo;accounting period&rsquo; which:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>begins when your company <a href=\"/limited-company-formation/set-up-your-company-for-corporation-tax\" title=\"Set up your company for Corporation Tax\">starts business activities</a></li>\n  <li>usually ends on your company&rsquo;s accounting reference date</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your company&rsquo;s accounting period for Corporation Tax can&rsquo;t be longer than 12 months. </p>\n\n<h2>How to align your company&rsquo;s reporting dates</h2>\n\n<p>How to align the dates depends on when your company started business activities.</p>\n\n<h3>Example: you started business after the company was set up</h3>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Action</th>\n      <th>Date</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Companies House set up</td>\n      <td>12 May 2011</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Date you started business activities</td>\n      <td>5 July 2011</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Companies House accounting reference date</td>\n      <td>31 May 2012</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Your reporting dates wil align when you send 2 tax returns: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>1 for the period before the company started business activities (12 May 2011 to July 4 2011)</li>\n  <li>1 for the period between the company starting business and the company&rsquo;s accounting reference date (5 July 2011 to 31 May 2012)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example: you started business activities the same day the company was set up</h3>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Action</th>\n      <th>Date</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Companies House set up and business activity started</td>\n      <td>12 May 2011</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>End of your company&rsquo;s first Corporation Tax accounting period</td>\n      <td>11 May 2012</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Companies House accounting reference date</td>\n      <td>31 May 2012</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>You must send:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>tax return 1 for period 12 May 2011 to 11 May 2012</li>\n  <li>tax return 2 for period 12 May 2012 to 31 May 2012</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>You can use 1 set of statutory accounts for both returns. <a href=\"https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/information/faqs/corporationTax?faqid=eng.faq.largecompanies.faq.faqct078\" title=\"sending 2 Company Tax Returns\" rel=\"external\"><abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp;
