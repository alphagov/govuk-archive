The type of car seat your child needs depends on their weight.</p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>Never carry a child on your lap, or use a single seat belt for 2 passengers whatever their age.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Only EU-approved baby seats, child car seats or booster cushions can be used in the UK. These have a label showing a capital ‘E’ in a circle. Second hand child seats or boosters must still meet current safety standards - check them thoroughly before accepting and make sure they haven&rsquo;t been involved in a crash.</p>\n\n<h2>Child car seat types</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Type of seat</th>\n      <th>Weight range</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Rear-facing baby seats</td>\n      <td>Babies up to 13kg</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Forward or rear-facing baby seats</td>\n      <td>Children from 9-18kg</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Forward-facing child car seats (booster seats)</td>\n      <td>Children from 15-25kg</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Booster cushions</td>\n      <td>Children over 22kg</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Some seats are adjustable and can be used as your child grows - check the seat label.</p>\n\n<h2>Using your child&rsquo;s car seat in the front seat</h2>\n\n<p>You can use your child&rsquo;s car seat in the front seat of a vehicle, if it fits. This includes 2-seater cars or convertibles with the top down.</p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>You must deactivate any frontal airbags before fitting a rear-facing baby seat.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Side-facing seats</h2>\n\n<p>Child car seats must not be used in side-facing seats.</p>\n\n<h2>Vehicles without seat belts</h2>\n\n<p>If your vehicle doesn’t have seat belts, a child over 3 can travel in the back seat without their car seat.</p>\n\n<p>Children under 3 must not travel in cars, vans or goods vehicles without a seat belt or their car seat.</p>\n\n<h2>Cars with integral child-sized seats</h2>\n\n<p>Some cars have their own (integral) child-sized seats that are only suitable for children. If the seat is approved for use instead of a child&rsquo;s car seat, it will have a label with an &lsquo;E&rsquo; in a circle. The label will also show the weight of the child that it’s approved for - usually above 15 kilograms.</p>\n\n<p>If the child-sized seat isn’t approved, your child will need to use their car seat. If their car seat doesn&rsquo;t fit, your child can&rsquo;t use the vehicle&rsquo;s integral child-sized seat.</p>\n\n<h2>Car seats in a seat with only a lap belt</h2>\n\n<p>If a seat only has a lap belt, you’ll still need to fit your child&rsquo;s car seat. </p>\n\n<p>Most seats can only be used with a belt that has a diagonal strap as well, so in this case you&rsquo;ll need to get a diagonal belt fitted.</p>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/child-car-seats-the-rules/car-seats-for-children-with-disabilities","slug":"car-seats-for-children-with-disabilities","order":2,"title":"Car seats for children with disabilities","body":"<p>Normal rules apply for children with disabilities unless a doctor says they’re exempt on medical grounds.
