  </header><p>Your will lets you decide what happens to your money, property and possessions after your death. </p>

<p>If you make a will you can also make sure you don’t pay more Inheritance Tax than you need to.</p>

<p>You can write your will yourself, but you should get legal advice, for example from <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk" title="Citizens Advice website">Citizens Advice</a> to make sure your will is interpreted in the way you wanted.</p>

<p>You need to get your will formally witnessed and signed to make it legally valid.</p>

<p>If you want to update your will, you need to make an official alteration (called a codicil) or make a new will.</p>

<p>If you die without a will, the law says who gets what.</p>

</article><article id="writing-your-will"><header><h1>Part 2: Writing your will</h1>
  </header><h2>What you should put in your will</h2>
<p>You should set out:</p>

<ul>
<li>who you want to benefit from your will</li>
  <li>who should look after any children under 18 </li>
  <li>who is going to sort out your estate and carry out your wishes after your death (your executor) </li>
  <li>what happens if the people you want to benefit die before you </li>
</ul>
<h2>When you need legal advice</h2>
<p>You should get advice from a professional if your will isn’t straightforward, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>you share a property with someone who isn’t your husband, wife or civil partner</li>
  <li>you want to leave money or property to a dependant who can’t care for themselves</li>
  <li>you have several family members who may make a claim on your will, eg a 2nd spouse or children from another marriage</li>
  <li>your permanent home isn’t in the UK</li>
  <li>you’re resident in the UK but have overseas property</li>
  <li>you have a business</li>
</ul>
<h2>Keep your will safe</h2>
<p>You should tell your executor (the person you’ve chosen to carry out your will), close friend or relative where it is.</p>

</article><article id="make-sure-your-will-is-legal"><header><h1>Part 3: Make sure your will is legal</h1>
  </header><p>For a will to be legally valid, it must be:</p>

<ul>
<li>made by a person 18 or over</li>
  <li>made voluntarily</li>
  <li>made by a person of sound mind</li>
  <li>in writing</li>
  <li>signed by the person making the will in the presence of 2 witnesses</li>
  <li>signed by the 2 witnesses, in the presence of the person making the will</li>
</ul></article><article id="witnessing-your-will"><header><h1>Part 4: Witnessing your will</h1>
  </header><p>You need to sign and witness your will formally to make it legal. You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>sign your will in the presence of 2 witnesses</li>
  <li>get your 2 witnesses to sign your will in your presence, after you’ve signed it</li>
  <li>make sure your witnesses are aged 18 or over</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to make any changes to your will you need to follow the same signing and witnessing process.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can’t leave your witnesses (and their married partners) anything in your will.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="updating-your-will"><header><h1>Part 5: Updating your will</h1>
  </header><p>You should review your will every 5 years and after any major change in your life, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>getting separated, married or divorced</li>
  <li>having a child </li>
  <li>moving house</li>
  <li>if the executor named in the will dies</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making changes to your will</h2>

<p>You can’t amend your will after it’s been signed and witnessed. The only way you can change a will is by making an official alteration called a codicil.</p>

<p>You must sign a codicil and get it witnessed in the same way as witnessing a will. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s no limit on how many codicils you can add to a will.</p>
</div>

<h2>Making a new will</h2>

<p>For major changes you should make a new will. </p>

<p>Your new will should explain that it revokes (officially cancels) all previous wills and codicils. You should destroy your old will by burning it or tearing it up.</p>
