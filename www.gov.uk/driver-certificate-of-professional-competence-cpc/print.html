  </header><p>After you’ve passed the initial qualification you’ll get a Driver Qualification Card (<abbr title="Driver Qualification Card">DQC</abbr>).</p>

<p>You must carry your <abbr title="Driver Qualification Card">DQC</abbr> while driving a large goods vehicle (<abbr title="Large Goods Vehicle">LGV</abbr>) or passenger carrying vehicle (<abbr title="Passenger Carrying Vehicle">PCV</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you’ve got your Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>) through <a href="getting-driver-cpc-through-acquired-rights" title="‘acquired rights’">‘acquired rights’</a> you won’t get a <abbr title="Driver Qualification Card">DQC</abbr> and your licence is proof of Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You don’t need to keep your licence with you, but if asked by the police, you must show it at a later date as proof of your ‘acquired rights’.</p>

<h2>Getting your <abbr title="Driver Qualification Card">DQC</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>If you have a photocard licence</h3>

<p>You’ll get your <abbr title="Driver Qualification Card">DQC</abbr> when you’ve completed either your initial qualification or your 35 hours of periodic training if you have a Great Britain (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) photocard licence. It will be sent to the address on your driving licence.</p>

<h3>If you have a paper licence</h3>

<p>If you have a paper licence you’ll need to swap it for a photocard licence before you can get your <abbr title="Driver Qualification Card">DQC</abbr>. This is because the <abbr title="Driver Qualification Card">DQC</abbr> needs a photograph and signature, which are taken from the photocard details.</p>

<h2>Applying for a replacement <abbr title="Driver Qualification Card">DQC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If your <abbr title="Driver Qualification Card">DQC</abbr> has been lost, stolen or damaged you should write to or email the Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>).</p>

<p>Tell <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> your:</p>

<ul>
<li>name</li>
  <li>driving licence number</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>telephone number</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> will then call you back. You’ll need a credit or debit card to pay for the replacement.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can still drive professionally in the UK while you’re waiting for your replacement <abbr title="Driver Qualification Card">DQC</abbr> to arrive.</p>

</article><article id="getting-driver-cpc-through-acquired-rights"><header><h1>Part 6: Getting Driver CPC through 'acquired rights'</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re an existing professional driver, you could get Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> through <strong>‘acquired rights’</strong>. This means that because you’ve already been working as a lorry or bus driver your experience is counted as equivalent to taking the Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> tests.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll still need to complete 35 hours of periodic training every 5 years to keep your Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<p>This applies if you are a:</p>

<ul>
<li>bus or coach driver and got your vocational licence (D, D1, D+E and D1+E) before 10 September 2008</li>
  <li>lorry driver and got your vocational licence (C, C1, C+E and C1+E) before 10 September 2009</li>
</ul>
<h3>When you need to complete periodic training</h3>

<p>If you’ve got your Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> by ‘acquired rights’ you must do 35 hours of periodic training by:</p>

<ul>
<li>9 September 2013 if you are a bus or coach driver</li>
  <li>9 September 2014 if you are a lorry driver</li>
</ul>
<h2>Licences where you don’t have ‘acquired rights’</h2>

<p>You don’t have ‘acquired rights’ if you have a D, D1, D+E or D1+E licence with ‘not for hire or reward’ or ‘101’ on it.</p>

<p>You will have to take the Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> initial qualification as normal to drive professionally, and then do periodic training.</p>

<h2>Driving a larger or different type of vehicle and adding trailer entitlements</h2>

<p>If you’ve already got a vocational licence and want to add a trailer entitlement or drive a larger vehicle of the same type you won’t have ‘acquired rights’ to do this automatically, but will only have to pass Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> modules 1 and 3. </p>

<p>If you have only a lorry or bus licence and want to drive both, you don’t have ‘acquired rights’ to do so. You’ll need to pass all 4 modules or the relevant bus or lorry initial Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> qualification to start driving the new type of vehicle professionally.</p>


</article><article id="driver-cpc-periodic-training"><header><h1>Part 7: Driver CPC periodic training</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must do 35 hours of periodic training every 5 years to keep your Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (<abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>).</p>
</div>

<p>You can <a href="/check-your-driver-cpc-periodic-training-hours" title="Check your Driver CPC periodic training hours">check how many hours you’ve done</a> in the current 5-year period.</p>

<h2>How to find training courses</h2>

<p>Only approved courses taken with <a rel="external" href="http://www.drivercpc-periodictraining.org/en/approved-centres-courses" title="approved training centres">approved training centres</a> will count towards periodic training. It’s up to you to decide which to attend.</p>

<p>There is no test to pass and courses can be practical or classroom based.</p>

<p>If you drive both lorries and buses professionally you only need to complete 1 set of training every 5 years.</p>

<h2>When to take Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> periodic training</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>It’s up to you when you take the training courses, as long as you do them within 5 years.</p>
</div>

<h3>When the 5-year period starts</h3>

<p>Each 5-year period starts from 5 years before your current Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> qualification runs out - not from the date you completed your last 35 hours of training.</p>

<p>For all <a href="getting-driver-cpc-through-acquired-rights" title="'acquired rights'">‘acquired rights’</a> drivers it started on:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 September 2008 for category D, D1, D+E and D1+E drivers</li>
  <li>10 September 2009 for category C, C1, C+E and C1+E drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got bus and lorry entitlements and want to keep your Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> for both, you must complete your 35 hours of periodic training in the 5 years before the earliest expiry date.</p>
