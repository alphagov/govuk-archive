  </header><p>If your employer offers you company shares as part of a government approved share scheme you get tax advantages, like not paying Income Tax or National Insurance on their value.</p>

<p>Approved schemes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Share Incentive Plans</li>
  <li>Save As You Earn Schemes</li>
  <li>Company Share Option Plans</li>
  <li>Enterprise Management Incentive Schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Employee share schemes that aren’t approved by the government don’t have the same tax advantages.</p>
</div>

<h2>Capital Gains Tax</h2>

<p>Sometimes you have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you sell your shares.</p>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) has produced a guide to help you understand the rules about Capital Gains Tax and employee share schemes.</p>

</article><article id="share-incentive-plans-sips"><header><h1>Part 2: Share Incentive Plans (SIPs)</h1>
  </header><p>If you get shares through a <abbr title="Share Incentive Plan">SIP</abbr> and keep them in the plan for 5 years you won’t pay Income Tax or National Insurance on their value.</p>

<p>If you sell the shares:</p>

<ul>
<li>you won’t pay Capital Gains Tax if you keep them in the plan until you sell them</li>
  <li>if you take them out of the plan, keep them and then sell them later on, you might have to pay Capital Gains Tax if their value has increased</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 4 ways you can get shares under <abbr title="Share Incentive Plans">SIPs</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Free shares</h2>

<p>Your employer can give you up to £3,000 of free shares in any tax year. </p>

<h2>Partnership shares</h2>

<p>You can buy shares out of your salary before tax deductions. There’s a limit to how much you can spend - either £1,500 or 10% of your income for the tax year, whichever is lower.</p>

<h2>Matching shares</h2>

<p>Your employer can give you up to 2 free matching shares for each partnership share you buy.</p>

<h2>Dividend shares</h2>

<p>If you get dividends from free, partnership or matching shares:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can use them to buy more shares</li>
  <li>you won’t pay Income Tax if you keep the dividend shares for at least 3 years</li>
  <li>you can invest up to £1,500 of dividends each tax year in this way</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you take shares out of a <abbr title="Share Incentive Plan">SIP</abbr> early, you’ll have to pay Income Tax and National Insurance on them.</p>
</div>

<p>There’s detailed information on <abbr title="Share Incentive Plans">SIPs</abbr> in a guide from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

</article><article id="save-as-you-earn-saye"><header><h1>Part 3: Save As You Earn (SAYE)</h1>
  </header><p>This is a savings-related share scheme where you can buy shares with your savings for a fixed price.</p>

<p>You can save up to £250 a month under the scheme. At the end of your savings contract (3, 5 or 7 years) you can use the savings to buy shares. The tax advantages are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the interest and any bonus at the end of the scheme is tax-free unless you cash it in early</li>
  <li>you don’t pay Income Tax or National Insurance on the difference between what you pay for the shares and what they’re worth</li>
</ul>
<p>You might have to pay Capital Gains Tax when you sell the shares - but not if you put them into an ISA or pension as soon as you buy them.</p>

<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) has produced a guide to the rules of <abbr title="Save As You Earn">SAYE</abbr> schemes.</p>
