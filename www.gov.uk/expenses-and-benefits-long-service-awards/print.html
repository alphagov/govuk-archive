  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing long-service awards to your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>What you have to report and pay depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>if the award is cash, non-cash or ‘<a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/payroll/special-pay/non-cash.htm" title="readily-convertible assets">readily-convertible assets</a>’ (<abbr title="readily convertible assets">RCAs</abbr>), eg shares</li>
  <li>how much the award is for</li>
  <li>how long the employee has worked for you</li>
  <li>if you’ve given them a long-service award before</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What’s exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report or pay on a non-cash award to an employee if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>they’ve worked for you for at least 20 years</li>
  <li>the award is worth less than £50 per year of service</li>
  <li>you haven’t given them a long-service award in the last 10 years</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>For example, you can give a non-cash award with a value of up to £1,000 for 20 years’ service.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If any of the long-service awards you provide aren’t exempt, you must report the costs to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and deduct and pay tax and National Insurance on them.</p>

<h2>Cash awards</h2>

<p>Any cash you award to an employee counts as part of their earnings. You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>add this amount to your employee’s other earnings</li>
  <li>deduct and pay Class 1 National Insurance and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax through payroll</li>
</ul>
<h2>Non-cash awards</h2>

<p>For employees with at least 20 years service and no previous award in the last 10 years:</p>
